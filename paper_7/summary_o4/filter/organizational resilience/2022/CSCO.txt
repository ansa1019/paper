In fiscal 2022, Cisco delivered growth in total revenue and strong profitability in a challenging environment impacted by significant supply constraints, rising component and related costs, and the Russia and Ukraine war, and in response the company continued to take multiple steps to mitigate component shortages and deliver products to customers, including partnering with key suppliers, leveraging volume purchasing, revising supplier arrangements, modifying product designs to leverage alternate suppliers, paying higher component and logistics costs to secure supply, and continually optimizing inventory build and customer delivery plans. The company also increased its inventory balances, inventory purchase commitments, and inventory deposits and prepayments in order to secure critical components and meet customer demand despite extended lead times, while recognizing the increased risk of future material excess and obsolete inventory and related losses. In connection with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Cisco announced its intention to stop business operations in Russia and Belarus, assessed the risk to the recoverability of its assets in those countries, reserved for the non-recoverability of substantially all of those assets, and recognized non-recurring charges related to uncollectible receivables, special personnel-related charges to support impacted employees, and severance and exit costs. Despite these pressures, Cisco remained focused on accelerating innovation across its portfolio, transitioning its business model toward increased software and subscriptions, investing aggressively in priority areas to drive profitable growth over the long term, and reimagining its strategic initiatives to help customers connect, secure, and automate to accelerate their digital agility in a cloud-first world. The company maintains strong cash and investments, manages through a disciplined capital allocation strategy—including entering into a five-year $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with sustainability-linked metrics, targeting to return at least 50 percent of free cash flow to stockholders, and periodically engaging in secured securities-lending transactions—and believes these resources, together with its ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines, will satisfy its liquidity requirements, mitigate the effects of environmental turbulence such as the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical disruptions, and preserve or improve functioning while under internal or external variations and disturbances.

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Company continues to conduct business with modifications to employee work locations, with nearly all sites now fully open and a transition to a hybrid model under which the workforce spends part of its time in offices and part of its time working from home while the return-to-workplace strategy is continuously evaluated and refined. The Russia-Ukraine war and related sanctions have increased global economic and political uncertainty, and although the Company has not experienced significant disruptions to its operations, it cannot predict the full impact of these events on demand for its offerings, its customers and partners, government actions, the macroeconomic environment, or other factors identified in its risk disclosures. In April 2020, Intuit was approved as a non-bank SBA lender for the Paycheck Protection Program to provide small businesses with loans designed to pay payroll and group health costs, salaries and commissions, mortgage and rent payments, utilities and interest on other debt during the pandemic. The Company’s growth strategy depends upon its ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, enter new markets and drive broad adoption of its products and services, and its future growth increasingly hinges on the strength of its third-party business relationships through ongoing development, maintenance and strengthening of new and existing partnerships. To remain competitive and continue to grow, the Company is investing significant resources in its product development, marketing and sales capabilities and is investing substantial management attention and resources in its information technology infrastructure and in privacy and security capabilities, including ISO 27001 certification for a portion of its systems, implementation of additional security and industry-wide anti-fraud measures in collaboration with state and federal governments and regular review and updating of security measures at Credit Karma. Furthermore, in preparing its consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, senior management and the audit and risk committee oversee critical accounting policies and estimates—including revenue recognition, business combinations and impairment assessments of goodwill, acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets—exercising judgment and updating provisional amounts over defined measurement periods to reflect new information that could affect the carrying values of assets and liabilities.

Gilead continually evaluates its liquidity and capital resources, including access to external capital, to ensure that it can adequately and efficiently finance its operations; in this respect, cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities are managed to meet short- and long-term requirements. The company uses foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge a portion of its exposures to movements in foreign exchange rates, thereby mitigating risks associated with global operations. It invests strategically in its business and research and development pipeline through acquisitions, collaborations and licensing agreements to co-develop and co-commercialize late-stage clinical assets and technology platforms, allocating resources to maintain operational flexibility and responsiveness to evolving therapeutic needs. Purchase obligations, capital expenditure projects and other commitments entered into in the ordinary course support continuity of supply and infrastructure expansion. Gilead periodically reassesses legal contingencies and adjusts its estimates and assumptions as new information becomes available, reflecting a proactive approach to risk assessment and resilience under potential adverse outcomes; for example, in connection with its acquisition of immunomedics, the company updated its estimate of the fair value of its hr+/her2- ipr&d intangible asset and recognized a partial impairment charge of $2.7 billion after revised market share assumptions and launch timing delays reduced expected cash flows. It balances shareholder returns, including dividends and share repurchases, with debt repayments and other capital obligations to preserve financial health. The company maintains a framework for anticipating future capital needs—considering factors such as commercial performance, progress and scope of R&D efforts, regulatory reviews, expansion of sales and marketing capabilities, potential acquisitions, debt service requirements, collaborative relationships and litigation costs—and acknowledges that additional funding, whether through equity or debt financings, may be required to support sustained growth and the maintenance of performance under varying conditions.

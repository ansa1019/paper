NEE’s operating performance relies on resource deployment and continues to evolve through capital investments and financing strategies to maintain system integrity under varying conditions. Management’s use of adjusted earnings supports performance maintenance and strategic planning, while capital requirements are met through diversified sources of liquidity, including cash flows, borrowings, and equity issuances. FPL’s continued investments in plant in service and other property, including the addition of the Dania Beach Clean Energy Center and ongoing transmission and distribution additions, exemplify operational flexibility and adaptation. During 2022, FPL incurred approximately $1.3 billion of recoverable storm restoration costs following hurricanes and filed a petition with the Florida PSC requesting recovery and replenishment of storm reserve funds, demonstrating crisis response and recovery mechanisms. NEE, including FPL, is monitoring solar supply chain disruptions from Southeast Asian locations and is taking steps intended to mitigate potential risks to solar project development and construction activities, without material impact to operations, reflecting proactive risk mitigation and continuity planning. Strategic acquisitions, such as GridLiance and portfolios of renewable energy projects and related service providers, further enhance system resilience and resource reconfiguration. Guarantee arrangements, letters of credit, and multiple credit facilities support liquidity and collateral requirements under contractual obligations, thereby preserving operational continuity under adverse market conditions. Derivative instruments and marked-to-market energy contracts managed through policy-approved hedging strategies and value-at-risk modeling provide risk mitigation against commodity price, interest rate, and equity price volatility. Regulatory accounting for storm funds, decommissioning reserve funds, and asset retirement obligations ensures the maintenance of financial integrity and future orientation under regulatory and operational pressures. NEE’s rigorous assessment of long-lived assets for impairment, the calibration of actuarial assumptions for pension obligations, and the recognition of regulatory assets and liabilities collectively illustrate a systemic perspective and dynamic capability in preserving or improving functioning amid environmental perturbations and financial disturbances.

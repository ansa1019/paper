KKR’s discussion of the business environment repeatedly emphasizes the firm’s ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, noting that “global and regional economic conditions can each have substantial impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations” and that “despite various economic headwinds, several key economic indicators in the U.S., including employment have demonstrated resilience in 2022.”  The firm describes how monetary and fiscal tightening, elevated inflation, supply-chain bottlenecks—from shifting Russia-Ukraine supply chains to dynamic zero-Covid policies—and currency volatility have put “significant pressure on corporate profits and consumer balance sheets,” while disruptions to energy markets and geopolitical uncertainty have increased credit spreads and default risk.  Against this backdrop, KKR has sought operational flexibility by rotating into higher-yielding assets, extending asset-liability cash-flow matching strategies that “intend to hold these investments until recovery of the losses,” managing liquidity through stress-tested credit facilities and CLOs, and revising assumptions for policy reserves and deferred acquisition costs as part of annual reviews to mitigate risk.  The firm also highlights its use of forward-looking performance metrics—such as fee paying assets under management, uncalled capital commitments, capital invested and interest-rate sensitivities—to guide resource allocation, capital raising, and funding decisions, while noting that its capital markets business “synchronize[s] underwriting, syndication and other capital markets services” in response to volatility.  Collectively, these disclosures illustrate KKR’s systemic perspective on risk assessment, its reconfiguration of investment and funding strategies, and its adaptive responses to external pressures in order to preserve or improve functioning under varying economic and market disturbances.

We offer choice and flexibility to our customers through multiple deployment models—on-premise, cloud-based and hybrid—facilitating the product, service and deployment combinations that best suit customer needs and enabling customers to pivot and migrate workloads to the Oracle Cloud while managing cloud capacity to meet existing and prospective demand. We emphasize the renewal of license support and cloud services contracts to ensure continuity of access to updates and support, and we continue to invest in research and development, cloud operations capacity and geographic expansion to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning amid economic pressures, supply-chain constraints and global events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and our withdrawal from Russia and Belarus. We allocate internally generated cash, marketable securities and credit facilities to fund acquisitions, dividend payments, stock repurchases and capital expenditures, estimating potential impacts on earnings, cash flows and return on invested capital before proceeding with transactions. We maintain a systemic perspective by annually reviewing goodwill and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment, evaluating contingent liabilities and uncertain tax positions, monitoring legal proceedings and reassessing critical accounting judgments, thereby preserving the integrity of our reporting units and financial statements under adverse conditions. Our proactive working capital management, selective acquisition program, differentiated services offerings and disciplined risk-mitigation strategies support operational flexibility, business continuity and sustained performance in turbulent markets.

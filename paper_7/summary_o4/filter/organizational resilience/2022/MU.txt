In the fourth quarter of 2022, the memory and storage industry environment deteriorated sharply due to global and macroeconomic challenges combined with downward inventory adjustments by customers, leading to significant reductions in bit shipments and average selling prices for both DRAM and NAND, and for the first quarter of 2023, continuation of these challenging conditions and inventory adjustments by customers have resulted in further reductions in near-term demand, prompting selective reduction of facility utilization in both DRAM and NAND to address elevated inventory levels and manage supply growth while anticipating inflationary pressure as a continued headwind to costs. Our primary sources of liquidity—cash generated from operations and financing obtained from capital markets and financial institutions—are continuously evaluated, with investments in high-credit-quality financial institutions constrained by policy limits on concentration of credit exposure to mitigate credit risk, and $2.50 billion available under our revolving credit facility as of September 1, 2022, to support operating continuity. To develop new product and process technology, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality, we continue to invest in manufacturing technologies, facilities, equipment, and R&D, breaking ground on a leading-edge memory manufacturing fab in Boise, Idaho, and announcing plans for a second fab in Clay, New York, contingent on Chips Act support to fulfill additional wafer capacity in line with industry demand trends. A discretionary share repurchase program with no expiration date and a quarterly dividend policy provide capital allocation flexibility based on financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions, debt service obligations, contractual restrictions, and other relevant factors. We expect that our cash and investments, cash flows from operations, and available financing will be sufficient to meet our requirements at least through the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Critical accounting estimates, including inventory lower-of-cost-or-net-realizable-value adjustments under FIFO cost, impairment assessments of property, plant, and equipment upon adverse indicators, and goodwill qualitative and quantitative tests, are evaluated on an ongoing basis to preserve asset integrity, recognize losses when appropriate, and support risk management in a volatile operating environment.

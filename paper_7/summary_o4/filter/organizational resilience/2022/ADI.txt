In fiscal 2022, the company confronted the operational and supply-chain disruptions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic by modifying business practices—including restricting employee travel, adapting work locations and cancelling in-person meetings and events—and by relying on long-term contingency planning and strategic flexibility to maintain operations across global manufacturing facilities despite government-imposed restrictions, while acknowledging that the ultimate impacts on workforce, production and financial outcomes remain uncertain and dependent on future developments beyond its control. The acquisition and integration of Maxim prompted organizational initiatives to align global workforces and reconfigure engineering, sales, marketing and administrative activities, including transitioning facilities, subleasing property and incurring severance and benefit costs to secure synergies and preserve operational continuity. A sustained commitment to research and development and planned capital expenditures to expand internal manufacturing capacity demonstrate proactive resource allocation to sustain product leadership and adaptability. Cash and liquidity management strategies—such as monitoring subsidiary funds, maintaining diversified high-quality investments and securing access to short- and long-term financing under an unsecured revolving credit facility with covenant compliance—underpin financial resilience to fund operations, capital projects, research and development efforts and dividend payments. Inventory management efforts to balance manufacturing production, demand forecasting and supply variations further reflect operational agility in responding to market fluctuations.

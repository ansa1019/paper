Given uncertainty surrounding macroeconomic factors in the U.S. and globally—characterized by the supply chain environment, inflationary pressure, rising interest rates, labor shortages, and significant disruption in commodity markets—we have experienced increased difficulties in obtaining a sufficient supply of component materials and “are engaged in activities to seek to mitigate supply disruptions, but the global supply chain shortages will remain a challenge for the foreseeable future.” We take a holistic approach, “offering intelligent technology and systems designed to work together to make MIS intervention more available and applicable,” and have implemented a customer relief program providing credits against service fees, deferred lease payments, and extended payment terms to support customers’ clinical, operational, and economic priorities and ensure continuity of supply. During the COVID-19 pandemic, our priorities and actions focused on the health and safety of patients, customers, communities, and employees; supporting customers according to their priorities; ensuring continuity of supply by working with suppliers and distributors; economically securing our workforce; and continuing to invest in priority development programs while eliminating avoidable spend. We also “collected internal and external insights to inform decision-making on work models that would align with how employees will work in the current environment,” and implemented a return-to-office strategy as vaccination rates increased. To address growth and mitigate risks of disruption, we increased inventory—“including the transfer of equipment from inventory to property, plant, and equipment”—and established programs “designed to monitor and mitigate” associated credit risks from extended customer payment terms. Our strategic capital investments in facilities, vertical integration of imaging pipelines, instruments and accessories technologies, and digital solutions aim to expand manufacturing capacity, strengthen supply chain resilience, and support long-term resource deployment, with funding sourced from cash generated by operations. These measures reflect our adaptive operational management, risk mitigation activities, and strategic resource reconfiguration to preserve our operational continuity, absorb strain, and sustain performance under challenging conditions.

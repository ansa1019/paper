Chubb’s annual report discloses a range of measures and structures that support its ability to absorb strain and maintain performance under adverse conditions, including a product and geographic diversification that “has been a source of stability during periods of industry volatility,” a profit center structure granting senior management teams autonomy within underwriting authorities to make operating decisions and develop needed coverages, and a long-term strategy combining underwriting and investment income to sustain growth in book value. The company emphasizes comprehensive risk management through internal and external data and sophisticated catastrophe loss and risk modeling techniques, the setting of risk limits based on probable maximum loss estimates, and the purchase of layered catastrophe and terrorism reinsurance to ensure sufficient liquidity and capital during stress events. Liquidity and business continuity are reinforced by a highly liquid investment portfolio, cash balances, credit facilities, letters of credit and two multi-currency notional cash pooling programs that allow participating entities to draw overnight overdrafts so long as the overall pooled position remains positive. Chubb matches asset durations with liability profiles, tightly manages credit exposures across investments and reinsurance recoverables through collateral arrangements and default analyses, and applies rigorous risk-transfer assessments for structured products. The company also maintains diversified financing sources via shelf registrations, short-term and long-term debt issuances, repurchase agreements and committed credit lines, while governing dividend distributions and share repurchases in a manner designed to preserve capital strength and financial flexibility. Critical accounting policies—such as loss reserves, deferred policy benefits and goodwill impairment—are subject to ongoing review and adjustment as new experience, methods or regulatory changes emerge, reflecting an adaptive posture to internal and external perturbations.

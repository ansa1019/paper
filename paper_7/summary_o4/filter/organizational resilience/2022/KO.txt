Throughout 2022, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the resurgence of the virus in certain countries and related government containment measures, as well as supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, inflationary pressures, geopolitical conflicts and foreign currency fluctuations, continued to introduce significant uncertainties and constraints to our operations, yet “we are focused on executing for growth” and “believe we are well positioned to create value for our company and our stakeholders” by investing in our portfolio of brands, our strategic capabilities and our people.  We maintain rigorous product and ingredient safety and quality standards under an integrated quality management program that “continually measures all operations within the Coca-Cola system against the same stringent standards,” regularly assesses and mitigates risks, and drives continuous improvement to preserve functioning under nominal, extreme or exceptional pressures.  Our sustainability focus areas—encompassing water stewardship, sustainable packaging, greenhouse gas reduction, sustainable sourcing of agricultural commodities, diversity, equity and inclusion, and human and workplace rights—reflect a systemic perspective and commitment to organizational health and resilience under external pressures.  We have strengthened our operational flexibility and resource deployment by executing structural changes—including acquisitions, refranchisings and divestitures—to reconstitute our geographic footprint and optimize resource configuration, and by performing recoverability and impairment tests of assets and intangible assets based on management’s best assumptions in volatile markets.  To manage liquidity and support business continuity, we collaborate with suppliers to extend payment terms, offer a voluntary supply chain finance program, deploy trade accounts receivable factoring, maintain substantial cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and backup credit facilities, self-insure against catastrophic losses and utilize foreign currency hedging to mitigate exchange rate variability.  We continuously align pricing initiatives, channel and package mix, marketing effectiveness, data-driven revenue growth management and innovation pipelines with evolving consumer needs, competitive landscapes and environmental turbulence to absorb strain, mitigate risk and preserve or improve our performance despite adversity.

Managementâ€™s discussion highlights that forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in condition, value and effect, including persistent uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic, broadening supply-chain constraints and inflationary cost pressures that may negatively impact revenue and gross margin, thereby necessitating ongoing risk assessment, adaptability and operational flexibility. Our customer support business group provides products and services to maximize installed equipment performance, predictability and operational efficiency, reflecting strategic initiatives to ensure business continuity under external pressures. We maintain significant research and development and sustaining engineering investments, leverage cycles of learning from our broad installed base, engage in collaborative programs with semiconductor ecosystem partners and continuously identify and invest across our product portfolio to meet technology inflections, demonstrating our capacity to absorb strain, innovate and reconfigure resource deployment in the face of environmental disruptions. We have built a strong global presence with core competencies in areas such as advanced systems engineering, nanoscale applications enablement, chemistry, plasma and fluidics, enabling us to respond effectively to evolving semiconductor device complexities and emerging market demands. Maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves and anticipating cash flows to support operations, capital expenditures, debt service and dividends through at least the next twelve months, while preserving access to capital markets if necessary, embodies our systemic resilience and ability to preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions, and we recognize that global economic uncertainty and credit market disruptions may impact customer demand and our ability to manage commercial relationships, underscoring the importance of strategic foresight and proactive resource reconfiguration.

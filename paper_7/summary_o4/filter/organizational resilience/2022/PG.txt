Procter & Gamble’s MD&A discloses a broad set of capabilities and strategies that support its ability to absorb strain and maintain or improve functioning under adverse conditions, including the ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements through supply-chain optimizations and sole‐supplier and sole‐plant arrangements to manage disruptions from natural disasters, acts of war or disease outbreaks; to successfully manage global financial risks such as foreign-currency fluctuations, pricing controls, localized volatility and credit‐market disruptions; to navigate local, regional or global economic volatility while generating sufficient income and cash flow; to manage cost fluctuations and pressures across commodities, labor, transportation, energy, pension and healthcare; to stay on the leading edge of innovation, secure intellectual property and respond to changing consumer habits, evolving digital platforms and competitive technological advances; to compete effectively across new and existing sales channels by responding to pricing, promotional incentives and trade terms; to maintain and strengthen key customer relationships and protect reputation and brand equity against safety, quality, packaging or supply-chain practice concerns; to manage the financial, legal, reputational and operational risks of third-party relationships; to rely on and secure critical information and operational technology systems, networks and data; and to navigate changing political conditions, regulatory and legal requirements, tax changes and international trade agreements. The company emphasizes ongoing productivity improvements, supply-chain optimization, general overhead and workforce restructuring, extended payment terms and supply-chain financing as means to strengthen operational effectiveness and mitigate challenging cost environments. It also highlights acting with agility and constructively disrupting its industry—innovating, communicating and leveraging new technologies—while enhancing clarity of roles, accountability and incentive compensation, and developing next-level supply-chain capabilities “to enable flexibility, agility, resilience and a new level of productivity adapting to a new reality.” Throughout periods of significant macroeconomic pressures, a global pandemic and geopolitical conflicts, P&G maintains a disciplined investment approach, implements employee safety measures to minimize manufacturing and distribution disruptions, manages liquidity through operating cash flow and capital-markets access, and deploys cash to dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and joint ventures, all underpinned by robust risk management and forward-looking planning to preserve system integrity and sustain performance under stress.

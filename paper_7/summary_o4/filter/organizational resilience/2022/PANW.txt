The company emphasizes its capacity to protect and sustain operations under adverse conditions by empowering enterprises, service providers and government entities to defend against sophisticated cyber threats with comprehensive, AI-driven and automated cybersecurity platforms that unify network, cloud and endpoint protection and eliminate siloed point solutions to improve operational efficiency and reduce total cost of ownership. It reports ongoing investments in innovation and timely feature development as essential to adapting to changing customer needs and maintaining competitive advantage. In response to external disruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the company instituted a global work-from-home policy, actively monitors health and safety developments, provides enabling technology for remote workforces and reports no material operational disruptions during fiscal 2022, while continuing to adjust business operations as required and prioritizing employee safety and community well-being. To mitigate supply chain constraints, including chip shortages, it works closely with manufacturing partners to minimize delays and cost impacts. The company further underscores the need to strengthen and expand its information technology and financial infrastructure, operating and administrative systems, and its capabilities to manage headcount, capital and processes efficiently in order to support future growth. It highlights its liquidity and capital resource planning—maintaining substantial cash and investments and monitoring cash flow from operations, deferred revenue and billings—to ensure sufficient resources to meet anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months, while acknowledging that future funding requirements will depend on factors such as growth initiatives, product development, manufacturing capacity, macroeconomic conditions and debt obligations.

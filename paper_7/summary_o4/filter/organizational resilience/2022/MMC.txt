The company’s management discussion emphasizes its capacity to help clients “navigate an increasingly dynamic and complex environment” through market-leading risk advisory, insurance and reinsurance broking, capital strategies, technology-driven workforce solutions and strategic economic and brand consulting, thereby supporting business continuity, risk mitigation and the maintenance of performance under external pressures. In discussing the COVID-19 pandemic, the MD&A states that “our businesses have remained resilient throughout the pandemic and demand for our advice and services remains strong,” reflecting positive adjustment under challenging conditions, and it similarly notes that it “continues to monitor the ongoing [Ukraine] situation and its potential impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.” To preserve operational flexibility and reconfigure resources, the company incurred $427 million of restructuring costs in 2022, “primarily related to severance and lease exit charges for activities focused on workforce actions, technology rationalization and reductions in real estate,” and expects related savings of $125 million to $150 million in 2023 with continued implementation into 2024. Its liquidity and capital resource management—including a $2.8 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, senior note issuances maturing through 2052, net investment hedges to manage foreign exchange variability, disciplined pension funding to maintain an 80 percent ERISA-based funded status, and strategic acquisitions and dispositions with contingent consideration adjustments—demonstrates systemic resilience by enabling the company to absorb strain, preserve integrity, adapt to environmental disruptions and maintain its functioning and performance under adverse and evolving conditions.

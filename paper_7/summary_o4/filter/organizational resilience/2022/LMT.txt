Lockheed Martin operates in a complex and evolving global security environment and has adopted a strategy focused on designing and developing platforms and systems that meet future requirements, accelerating the adoption of advanced networking and operational technologies to make forces more agile, adaptive and unpredictable, integrating new and existing systems across all domains, forging strategic partnerships, executing a multi-year business transformation initiative to enhance digital infrastructure and collaboration, and maintaining fiscal discipline. Underpinning our ability to execute this strategy is our talent and culture; we invest substantially in our people to ensure our workforce has the technical skills necessary to succeed, and we continue to invest internally in innovative technologies that address rapidly evolving mission requirements, while routinely evaluating our portfolio through independent research and development activities, acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and internal realignment to strengthen our products and services and deepen connections to commercial industry. COVID-19 continued to cause business impacts in 2022: the emergence of the Omicron variant adversely impacted our operations and our supply chain, resulting in disruptions, delays, labor challenges associated with employee absences, travel restrictions, site access and adjusted work schedules; the recovery has been slower than originally anticipated, in particular within our supply chain; to mitigate supply chain risks, we accelerated payments of $1.5 billion to suppliers due according to contractual terms in future periods, prioritized small businesses and at-risk businesses, deployed resources at supplier sites to improve oversight and performance, and continue to monitor and may utilize accelerated payments in 2023 on an as-needed basis. Heightened levels of inflation and the potential worsening of macro-economic conditions present risks for us, our suppliers and the broader defense industrial base; for new contract proposals, we are factoring heightened levels of inflation based on accepted DOD escalation indices and other assumptions, and in some cases seeking the inclusion of economic price adjustment clauses, while remaining committed to increasing the efficiency of our operations and improving the cost competitiveness and affordability of our products and services to offset cost increases. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has significantly elevated global geopolitical tensions and security concerns, resulting in increased demand for our products and services, and we are evaluating capacity at our operations and the supply chain to anticipate potential demand, monitoring impacts, seeking to mitigate disruptions, and enhancing our defensive posture against increased cyber threats. We retain significant liquidity through cash, cash equivalents and access to credit markets, actively manage debt maturities, interest rates and pension obligations through pension risk-transfer transactions, and employ a balanced cash deployment strategy—comprising capital expenditures, independent research and development, strategic acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases—to sustain organizational performance, preserve operational continuity and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

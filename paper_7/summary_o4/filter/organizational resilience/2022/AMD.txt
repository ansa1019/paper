During 2022, we undertook transformative initiatives to scale and reshape our business by completing the strategic acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando, thereby expanding our technology and product portfolio, accessing new markets and customers, and diversifying our business model to absorb external disturbances and preserve performance; our 2022 financial results reflect the strength of this diversified model despite challenging PC market conditions and significant inventory correction actions across the supply chain. We continued executing our product technology roadmap with the launch of next-generation EPYC processors, HPC and AI accelerators, embedded SoCs and mobile processors to optimize workload processing, resource utilization and operational flexibility across data center, gaming, client and embedded segments. To reinforce our financial resilience, we issued $1 billion of senior notes, established a $3 billion revolving credit facility and a $3 billion commercial paper program, and we believe our combined cash, short-term investments, operating cash flows and credit arrangements will be sufficient to fund operations and capital commitments over the next 12 months and beyond. Although the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our operations, we experienced limited disruptions in 2022 and continue to monitor public health measures to support business continuity; we also realigned our reporting segments to mirror management’s strategic end-market oversight and resource allocation processes. We actively manage operating assets and liabilities—building inventories for advanced process nodes, making prepayments under long-term supply agreements and timing payments to suppliers—to mitigate supply chain risks, sustain organizational integrity under environmental perturbations and maintain performance under pressure.

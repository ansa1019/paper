In response to a series of external pressures—including supply chain disruptions, inflationary cost environments, shifting consumer preferences, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, climate-related regulatory developments, geopolitical volatility such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, currency fluctuations and a rapidly evolving retail landscape—the company has undertaken a strategic end-to-end transformation under its “pep+” framework, placing sustainability and human capital at the center of its efforts to absorb strain, preserve functioning and emerge stronger from adversity. To support business continuity and organizational flexibility, PepsiCo leverages an integrated risk management framework designed to identify, assess, prioritize, address, manage, monitor and communicate risks across all hierarchical levels and geographic markets, with oversight by the Board of Directors and its designated committees (audit; compensation; nominating and governance; sustainability, diversity and public policy), supplemented by the PepsiCo Risk Committee, division and country risk committees, a centralized Risk Management Office, internal audit, compliance and ethics, and a disclosure committee. The company continuously monitors existing and proposed laws and regulations, commodity and energy price volatility, foreign exchange exposures, cyber-security threats and other hazards and employs hedging strategies, fixed-price contracts, derivative instruments, productivity initiatives and global purchasing programs to mitigate risk and maintain performance. Further measures to bolster resilience include real-time adjustments to reporting calendars, proactive portfolio realignment through divestitures and brand repositioning, targeted capital investments, the expansion of e-commerce and digital capabilities, the deployment of regenerative agriculture and circular value-chain initiatives, and ongoing engagement with external experts and strategic partners—thereby ensuring the partial maintenance of integrity and operational continuity, the adaptive reconfiguration of resources and the preservation of growth trajectories under challenging conditions.

Salesforce has implemented a restructuring plan initiated in January 2023, intended to reduce operating costs, improve operating margins and continue advancing its commitment to profitable growth, which includes a workforce reduction of approximately ten percent and select real estate exits and office space reductions; the company anticipates improvements in its operating expenses across all categories, particularly in sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses, and expects to incur $600 million to $1.1 billion of restructuring charges in the near term. To support business continuity and scalability, Salesforce intends to continue investing additional resources in its enterprise cloud computing services, data center capacity and professional services headcount to evolve its security measures and facilitate customer adoption, and further expects research and development, marketing and sales and general and administrative expenses to grow in absolute dollars while potentially moderating as a percentage of revenues as a result of its hiring pause, amortization of deferred commissions and process efficiency initiatives. Despite macroeconomic factors that have led to measured buying behavior, stretched sales cycles, additional approval layers, deal compression and foreign currency volatility negatively impacting revenues by approximately four percent and remaining performance obligations by approximately one percent, Salesforce believes its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $12.5 billion, accounts receivable of $10.8 billion, unbilled amounts under non-cancelable subscription agreements and $3.0 billion credit facility will be sufficient to meet working capital, capital expenditure and debt maintenance needs over the next twelve months. The company manages seasonality-driven operating cash flow fluctuations by recognizing subscription and support revenues ratably over contract terms, billing customers in advance and leveraging the disproportionate weighting of fourth-quarter billings to bolster first-quarter collections, and during fiscal 2023 and in future periods has made, and expects to continue to make, additional investments in its infrastructure, technology upgrades, internal systems and environmental, social and governance programs to scale its operations, preserve system integrity and maintain performance under varying environmental and market conditions.

During the quarter ended March 31, 2022, economic sanctions were imposed on Russia by the U.S., European Union, United Kingdom and other jurisdictions and authorities, impacting Visa and its clients; in March 2022, we suspended our operations in Russia and as a result, are no longer generating revenue from domestic and cross-border activities related to Russia, and during the quarter ended March 31, 2022 we deconsolidated our Russian subsidiary, as required under U.S. GAAP, acknowledging the continuing effects of the war in Ukraine are difficult to predict due to numerous uncertainties and we will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business. Exchange rate movements, partially offset by our hedging program, negatively impacted our net revenues growth by approximately two-and-a-half percentage points. Our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives, with the objectives of providing adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios; ensuring timely completion of payments settlement activities; making planned capital investments in our business; paying dividends and repurchasing our shares at the discretion of our Board of Directors; and investing excess cash in securities that enable us to first meet our working capital and liquidity needs and earn additional income. Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe current and projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months and we will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances. As of September 30, 2022, we held $9.2 billion of our total available liquidity to fund daily settlement in the event one or more of our financial institution clients are unable to settle, with the remaining liquidity available to support our working capital and other liquidity needs. Pursuant to our longstanding capital management strategy, during fiscal 2022 we repurchased 56 million shares of our Class A common stock in the open market for $11.6 billion and issued â‚¬3.0 billion in euro-denominated fixed-rate senior notes with maturities ranging between four and twelve years, and we acquired the Currencycloud Group Limited and Tink AB to enhance our cross-border, open banking and payments infrastructure. During fiscal 2022, we recorded additional accruals of $861 million to address claims associated with the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation and deposited $850 million into the U.S. litigation escrow account, reflecting our ability to absorb strain, mitigate legal risk and preserve functioning under adverse conditions.

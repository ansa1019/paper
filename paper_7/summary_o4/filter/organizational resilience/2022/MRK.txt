Merck demonstrates resilience in maintaining positive adjustment under challenging conditions by continuously monitoring and mitigating war‐related interruptions to business continuity—working cross‐functionally to safeguard employee safety, ensure uninterrupted patient access to medicines and vaccines, support ongoing clinical trials outside Russia while suspending new study enrollments under compliance with international sanctions, and donating profits from Russian operations to humanitarian causes—and by adapting to COVID‐19 disruptions, which in 2021 reduced pharmaceutical sales by $1.3 billion, through strategic discontinuation of non‐viable programs, deployment of BARDA‐funded facility modifications to expand pandemic manufacturing capacity, and sustaining strong demand for a diversified product portfolio; facing ongoing macroeconomic and healthcare cost‐containment pressures, the company has realigned its operational footprint via a global restructuring program—optimizing its manufacturing and supply network, reducing real estate and workforce by recording $337 million and $661 million in restructuring charges in 2022 and 2021, respectively, and anticipating cumulative annual cost savings of approximately $900 million by 2023—alongside establishing revenue hedging, balance‐sheet risk management and net investment hedging strategies to protect against foreign‐currency volatility, all while preserving robust liquidity and capital allocation flexibility to fund research and development, strategic collaborations and acquisitions, dividend commitments and share repurchases, thereby safeguarding its ability to absorb strain, reconfigure resources, and sustain performance under adversity.

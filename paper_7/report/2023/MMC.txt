this md&a contains forward-looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. refer to "information concerning forward-looking statements" at the outset of this report.
non-gaap measures the company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states (u.s.), referred to as in accordance with "gaap" or "reported" results. the company also refers to and presents a non-gaap financial measure in non-gaap revenue, within the meaning of regulation g and item 10(e) of regulation s-k in accordance with the securities exchange act of 1934. the company has included a reconciliation of this non-gaap financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap as part of the consolidated revenue and expense discussion. percentage changes, referred to as non-gaap underlying revenue, are calculated by dividing the period over period change in non-gaap revenue by the prior period non-gaap revenue.
the company believes this non-gaap financial measure provides useful supplemental information that enables investors to better compare the company's performance across periods. management also uses this measure internally to assess the operating performance of its businesses and to decide how to allocate resources. however, investors should not consider this non-gaap measure in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the financial information that the company reports in accordance with gaap. the company's non-gaap measure includes adjustments that reflect how management views its businesses and may differ from similarly titled non-gaap measures presented by other companies.

consolidated operating income increased $1.0 billion, or 23% to $5.3 billion in 2023, compared to $4.3 billion in the prior year, reflecting a 10% increase in revenue and a 6% increase in expenses. revenue growth was driven by increases in the risk and insurance services and consulting segments of 11% and 7%, respectively.
the increase in revenue in 2023 reflects the continued demand for our advice and solutions, growth in new business and renewals, and investments in talent and capabilities. results also benefited from growth in the global economy, inflation, higher insurance and reinsurance pricing, and an increase in fiduciary income due to higher interest rates.
expenses increased in 2023 primarily due to compensation and benefits, driven by increased headcount, and higher base salary and incentive compensation. other operating expenses decreased due to lower restructuring and facility costs, partially offset by higher travel and entertainment costs compared to 2022. expenses in 2023 also include $51 million of insurance and indemnity recoveries for a legacy jardine lloyd thompson group plc ("jlt") errors and omissions ("e&o") matter relating to suitability of advice provided to individuals for defined benefit pension transfers in the united kingdom (u.k).
diluted earnings per share increased to $7.53 from $6.04, or 25% from the prior year. the increase is primarily the result of higher operating income in 2023, compared to the prior year.
consolidated revenue and expense revenue - non-gaap revenue and components of change the company advises clients in over 130 countries. as a result, foreign exchange rate movements may impact period over period comparisons of revenue. similarly, certain other items such as acquisitions and dispositions, including transfers among businesses, may impact period over period comparisons of revenue. non-gaap revenue measures the change in revenue from one period to the next by isolating these impacts on an underlying revenue basis. percentage changes, referred to as non-gaap underlying revenue, are calculated by dividing the period over period change in non-gaap revenue by the prior period non-gaap revenue.
the non-gaap revenue measure is presented on a constant currency basis excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. the company isolates the impact of foreign exchange rate movements period over period, by translating the current period foreign currency gaap revenue into u.s. dollars based on the difference in the current and corresponding prior period exchange rates.

consolidated revenue consolidated revenue increased $2.0 billion, or 10%, to $22.7 billion in 2023, compared to $20.7 billion in 2022. consolidated revenue increased 9% on an underlying basis and 1% from acquisitions. on an underlying basis, revenue increased 11% and 7% in 2023, in the risk and insurance services and consulting segments, respectively.
underlying revenue growth in the risk and insurance services and consulting segments in 2023 reflect the continued demand for our advice and solutions. in risk and insurance services, the increase in underlying revenue was primarily due to growth in new business and renewals. results also benefited from growth in the global economy, inflation, higher insurance and reinsurance pricing, and an increase in fiduciary income due to higher interest rates. in consulting, revenue growth reflects continued demand for our health, wealth, and career solutions and products, and consulting services.
consolidated operating expenses consolidated operating expenses increased $1.0 billion, or 6%, to $17.5 billion in 2023, compared to $16.4 billion in 2022. expenses reflect a 2% increase from acquisitions. expenses excluding the impact from acquisitions, increased 5% in 2023, with increases of 5% in both the risk and insurance services and consulting segments.
expenses increased in 2023 primarily due to compensation and benefits driven by increased headcount, and higher base salary and incentive compensation. other operating expenses decreased due to lower restructuring and facility costs, partially offset by higher travel and entertainment costs compared to 2022. the company incurred a total of $301 million for restructuring activities in 2023, compared to $427 million in 2022. expenses in 2023 also include $51 million of insurance and indemnity recoveries for a legacy jlt e&o matter relating to suitability of advice provided to individuals for defined benefit pension transfers in the u.k.
restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of 2022, the company initiated activities focused on workforce actions, rationalization of technology and functional services, and reductions in real estate. the company anticipates total charges related to these activities to be approximately $475 million. through december 31, 2023, the company has incurred $441 million of these restructuring costs, primarily related to severance and lease exit charges, of which $222 million were incurred in 2023. any remaining costs are expected to be incurred by the end of 2024. related estimated savings are expected to be approximately $400 million, with $230 million realized in 2023. the majority of the remaining savings are expected to be realized in 2024. the company continues to refine its detailed plans for each business and location, which may change the expected timing, estimates of expected costs and related savings.
restructuring activities also reflect jlt integration and restructuring costs in 2023 of $31 million, compared to $115 million in 2022, primarily related to lease exit charges for a legacy jlt u.k. location. for additional details, refer to note 14, restructuring costs, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
risk and insurance services in the risk and insurance services segment, the company's subsidiaries and other affiliated entities act as brokers, agents or consultants for insureds, insurance underwriters and other brokers in the areas of risk management, insurance broking, insurance program management, risk consulting, analytical modeling and alternative risk financing services, primarily under the brand of marsh, and engage in specialized reinsurance broking expertise, strategic advisory services and analytics solutions, primarily under the brand of guy carpenter.
marsh and guy carpenter are compensated for brokerage and consulting services through commissions and fees. commission rates and fees vary in amount and can depend on a number of factors, including the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided, the particular insurer or reinsurer selected, and the capacity in which the broker acts and negotiates with clients. revenues can be affected by premium rate levels in the insurance/reinsurance markets, the amount of risk retained by insurance and reinsurance clients, and by the value of the risks that have been insured since commission-based compensation is frequently related to the premiums paid by insureds and reinsureds. in many cases, fee compensation may be negotiated in advance, based on the type of risk, coverage required and service provided by the company and ultimately, the extent of the risk placed into the insurance market or retained by the client. the trends and comparisons of revenue from one period to the next can be affected by changes in premium rate levels, fluctuations in client risk retention and increases or decreases in the value of risks that have been insured, as well as new and lost business, and the volume of business from new and existing clients.
in addition to compensation from its clients, marsh also receives other compensation, separate from retail fees and commissions, from insurance companies. this other compensation includes, among other things, payment for consulting and analytics services provided to insurers; compensation for administrative and other services (including fees for underwriting services and services provided to or on behalf of insurers relating to the administration and management of quota shares, panels and other facilities in which insurers participate); and contingent commissions, which are paid by insurers based on factors such as volume or profitability of marsh's placements, primarily driven by marsh mclennan agency ("mma") and parts of marsh's international operations.
marsh and guy carpenter receive interest income on certain funds (such as premiums and claims proceeds) held in a fiduciary capacity for others. the investment of fiduciary funds is regulated by state and other insurance authorities. these regulations typically require segregation of fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made. interest income from these investments varies depending on the amount of funds invested and applicable interest rates, both of which vary from time to time. for presentation purposes, fiduciary interest income is segregated from the other revenues of marsh and guy carpenter and separately presented within the segment, as shown in the previous revenue by segments tables.
the results of operations for the risk and insurance services segment are as follows:

the major component of revenue in the consulting business is fees paid by clients for advice and services. mercer, principally through its health line of business, also earns revenue in the form of commissions received from insurance companies for the placement of group (and occasionally individual) insurance contracts, primarily life, health and accident coverages. revenue for mercer's investment management business and certain of mercer's defined benefit and contribution administration services consists principally of fees based on assets under management or administration. for a majority of the mercer managed investment funds, revenue is recorded on a gross basis with sub-advisor fees included in other operating expenses.
revenue in the consulting segment is affected by, among other things, global economic conditions, including changes in clients' particular industries and markets. revenue is also affected by competition due to the introduction of new products and services, broad trends in employee demographics, including levels of employment and the effect of government policies and regulations. revenues from investment management services and retirement trust and administrative services are significantly affected by the level of assets under management or administration, which is impacted by securities market performance.

the increase in underlying revenue at oliver wyman group in 2023 reflects broad-based growth across capabilities led by growth in the middle east and europe. revenue in 2022 also included a loss of $12 million related to the deconsolidation of the company's russian businesses.
the consulting segment completed 5 acquisitions in 2023. information regarding these acquisitions is included in note 5, acquisitions and dispositions, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
operating expenses expenses in the consulting segment increased $457 million, or 7%, to $7.0 billion in 2023, compared to $6.6 billion in 2022. expenses reflect an increase of 2% from acquisitions.
expenses in 2023 increased primarily due to compensation and benefits driven by increased headcount and higher base salary. the increase in expenses is partially offset by $51 million of insurance recoveries for a legacy jlt e&o matter relating to suitability of advice provided to individuals for defined pension transfers in the u.k.
in 2023, the company incurred $62 million of total restructuring cost in the consulting segment, compared to $77 million in the prior year, primarily related to the company's activities initiated in the fourth quarter of 2022, focused on workforce actions, rationalization of technology and functional services, and reductions in real estate.
expenses also reflect acquisition and integration related costs for the westpac transaction of $39 million, compared to $21 million in 2022.
corporate and other corporate expenses decreased $33 million, or 9%, to $329 million in 2023, compared to $362 million in 2022. the decrease in expenses reflects a 1% impact from foreign currency translation and lower facility and equipment costs in the current year.
interest income interest income was $78 million in 2023, compared to $15 million in 2022. interest income increased $63 million in 2023, due to an increase in corporate funds and higher interest rates.
interest expense interest expense was $578 million in 2023, compared to $469 million in 2022. interest expense increased $109 million in 2023, primarily due to an increase in long-term debt and higher interest rates.
investment income the caption "investment income" in the consolidated statements of income comprises realized and unrealized gains and losses from investments. it includes, when applicable, other than temporary declines in the value of securities, mark-to-market increases or decreases in equity investments with readily determinable fair values and equity method gains or losses on its investments in private equity funds. the company's investments may include direct investments in insurance, consulting or other strategically linked companies and investments in private equity funds. the company recorded net investment income of $5 million in 2023, compared to $21 million in 2022. the decrease in 2023 is primarily driven by lower mark-to-market gains from the company's private equity investments compared to the prior year.
income and other taxes the company's consolidated effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was 24.3% and 24.4%, respectively.
the tax rates in both years reflect the impact of discrete tax matters such as excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation, enacted tax legislation, changes in uncertain tax positions, deferred tax adjustments, non-taxable adjustments related to contingent consideration for acquisitions, and valuation allowances for certain tax credits. the 2023 effective tax rate reflects the previously-enacted change in the u.k. corporate income tax rate from 19% to 25%, which was effective april 1, 2023. the blended u.k. statutory tax rate for 2023 is 23.5%. the 2022 effective tax rate also reflects tax benefits from planning that postponed the utilization of u.k. tax losses to future years when the u.k. statutory tax rate will be 25%.
in 2023, the company released valuation allowances related to its non-u.s. operations. management determined that there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are realizable, primarily due to the sustained profitability of its operations. the valuation allowance release resulted in a decrease to tax expense of $94 million in the current year.
the effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period. the effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings and the cost to repatriate the company's earnings, which may result in higher or lower effective tax rates. therefore, a shift in the mix of profits among jurisdictions, or changes in the company's repatriation strategy to access offshore cash, can affect the effective tax rate. in 2023, pre-tax income in the u.k., canada, barbados, ireland, bermuda, india, united arab emirates, japan, and australia accounted for approximately 65% of the company's total non-u.s. pre-tax income, with effective rates in those countries of 20.0%, 27.3%, 1.2%, 23.2%, (18.8)%, 26.0%, 17.3%, 37.6%, and 26.0%, respectively.
in addition, losses in certain jurisdictions cannot be offset by earnings from other operations and may require valuation allowances that affect the rate in a particular period, depending on estimates of the value of associated deferred tax assets which can be realized. a valuation allowance was recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that the company believes is more likely than not to be realized. details are provided in note 7, income taxes, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. the effective tax rate is also sensitive to changes in unrecognized tax benefits, including the impact of settled tax audits and expired statutes of limitations.
changes in tax laws, rulings, policies or related legal and regulatory interpretations occur frequently and may also have significant favorable or adverse impacts on our effective tax rate. in july 2023, the u.k. enacted legislation to implement pillar 2 of the organization for economic cooperation and development's ("oecd") framework, effective from january 1, 2024. this minimum tax will be treated as a period cost in future years and does not impact operating results for 2023. other countries in the european union (e.u.) and elsewhere have similarly adopted legislation. the company is continuing to monitor legislative developments, especially in the e.u. countries, and is in the process of evaluating the potential impact of the u.k. and other enacted legislation on its results of future operations. currently, the company does not expect the impact of pillar 2 related legislation to be material in 2024.
on august 16, 2022, the inflation reduction act of 2022 ("ira") was enacted into law. the company evaluated the provisions of the ira, the most significant of which are the corporate alternative minimum tax and the share repurchase tax. the ira was effective as of january 1, 2023, and does not have a significant impact on the company's financial results of operations for the current year.
as a u.s.-domiciled parent holding company, the company is the issuer of essentially all of the company's external indebtedness, and incurs the related interest expense in the u.s. the company's interest expense deductions are not currently limited. further, most senior executive and oversight functions are conducted in the u.s. and the associated costs are incurred primarily in the u.s. some of these expenses may not be deductible in the u.s., which may impact the effective tax rate.
changes to the u.s. tax law in recent years have allowed the company to repatriate foreign earnings without incurring additional u.s. federal income tax costs as foreign income is generally already taxed in the u.s. however, permanent reinvestment continues to be a component of the company's global capital strategy. the company continues to evaluate its global investment and repatriation strategy in light of our capital requirements and potential costs of repatriation, which are generally limited to local country withholding taxes.
liquidity and capital resources the company is organized as a legal entity separate and distinct from its operating subsidiaries. as the company does not have significant operations of its own, the company is dependent upon dividends and other payments from its operating subsidiaries to pay principal and interest on its outstanding debt obligations, pay dividends to shareholders, repurchase its shares and pay corporate expenses. the company can also provide financial support to its operating subsidiaries for acquisitions, investments and certain parts of their business that require liquidity, such as the capital markets business of guy carpenter. other sources of liquidity include borrowing facilities in financing cash flows.
the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit from operating subsidiaries located outside of the u.s. funds from those operating subsidiaries are regularly repatriated to the u.s. out of annual earnings. at december 31, 2023, the company had approximately $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents in its foreign operations, which includes $462 million of operating funds required to be maintained for regulatory requirements or as collateral under certain captive insurance arrangements. the company expects to continue its practice of repatriating available funds from its non-u.s. operating subsidiaries out of current annual earnings. where appropriate, a portion of the current year earnings will continue to be permanently reinvested.
in 2023, the company recorded foreign currency translation adjustments which increased net equity by $274 million. continued weakening of the u.s. dollar against foreign currencies would further increase the translated u.s. dollar value of the company's net investments in its non-u.s. subsidiaries, as well as the translated u.s. dollar value of cash repatriations from those subsidiaries.
cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheets includes funds available for general corporate purposes. fiduciary assets are shown separately in the consolidated balance sheets as cash and cash equivalents held in a fiduciary capacity, with a corresponding amount in current liabilities. fiduciary assets cannot be used for general corporate purposes, and should not be considered as a source of liquidity for the company.
operating cash flows the company provided $4.3 billion of cash from operations in 2023, compared to $3.5 billion provided by operations in 2022. these amounts reflect the net income of the company during those periods, excluding gains or losses from investments, adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in working capital which relate primarily to the timing of payments of accrued liabilities, including incentive compensation, or receipts of receivables and pension contributions. the company used cash of $271 million and $193 million related to its restructuring activities in 2023 and 2022, respectively.
pension related items contributions the company's policy for funding its tax-qualified defined benefit plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in accordance with applicable law. in 2023, the company contributed $33 million to its u.s. defined benefit pension plans and $78 million to its non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans. in 2022, the company contributed $30 million to its u.s. defined benefit pension plans and $139 million to its non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans.
in the u.s., contributions to the tax-qualified defined benefit plans are based on employee retirement income security act ("erisa") guidelines and the company generally expects to maintain a funded status of 80% or more of the liability determined in accordance with the erisa guidelines. in 2023, the company made contributions of $33 million to its non-qualified plans and expects to contribute approximately $31 million in 2024. the company was not required to and made no contributions to its u.s. qualified plans in 2023. in 2024, the company is required to make contributions totaling $2 million to its u.s. qualified plans.
outside the u.s., the company has a large number of defined benefit pension plans, the largest of which are in the u.k., which comprise approximately 79% of non-u.s. plan assets at december 31, 2023. contribution rates for non-u.s. plans are generally based on local funding practices and statutory requirements, which may differ significantly from measurements in accordance with u.s. gaap.
in the u.k., the assumptions used to determine pension contributions are the result of legally-prescribed negotiations between the company and the plans' trustee that typically occur every three years in conjunction with the actuarial valuation of the plans. currently, this results in a lower funded status compared to u.s. gaap and may result in contributions irrespective of the u.s. gaap funded status.
in 2021, the jlt pension scheme was merged into the mmc u.k. pension fund with a new segregated jlt section created (referred to as the "jlt section").
the company contributed $42 million to its u.k. plans, including the jlt section, in 2023. the company's contributions to its u.k. plans, including the jlt section, for 2024 are expected to be approximately $39 million. the company made deficit contributions of $41 million to the jlt section in 2023, and is expected to make contributions totaling approximately $38 million in 2024.
for the mmc u.k. pension fund, excluding the jlt section, an agreement was reached with the trustee in the fourth quarter of 2022, based on the surplus funding position at december 31, 2021. in accordance with the agreement, no deficit funding is required at the earliest until 2026. the funding level will be re-assessed during 2025 as part of the december 31, 2024 actuarial valuation to determine if contributions are required in 2026. in december 2022, the company renewed its agreement to support annual deficit contributions that may be required by the u.k. operating companies under certain circumstances, up to £450 million (or $576 million) over a seven-year period. this is part of an agreement which gives the company greater influence over asset allocation and overall investment decisions.
the company expects to contribute approximately $78 million to its non-u.s. defined benefit plans in 2024, comprising approximately of $39 million to the u.k. plans and $39 million to plans outside of the u.k.
changes in funded status and expense the year-over-year change in the funded status of the company's pension plans is impacted by the difference between actual and assumed results, particularly with regard to return on assets, and changes in the discount rate, as well as the amount of company contributions, if any. unrecognized actuarial losses as of december 31, 2023, were approximately $1.3 billion and $3.2 billion for the u.s. plans and non-u.s. plans, respectively, compared with losses of $1.4 billion and $2.6 billion as of december 31, 2022. the decrease in the u.s. is primarily due to greater than expected returns on plan assets. the increase in the non-u.s. plans is primarily due to decreases in the discount rates used to measure plan liabilities, lower than expected returns on plan assets and the impact of foreign exchange. in the past several years, the amount of unamortized losses has been significantly impacted, both positively and negatively, by actual asset performance and changes in discount rates. the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities for the company's u.s. and u.k. plans decreased in 2023 and increased in 2022 and 2021. an increase in the discount rate decreases the measured plan benefit obligation, resulting in actuarial gains, while a decrease in the discount rate increases the measured plan obligation, resulting in actuarial losses. in 2023, the company's defined benefit pension plan assets had gains of 9.3% and 4.1% in the u.s. and u.k., respectively, as compared to losses of 18.3% and 29.2% in the u.s. and u.k., respectively, in 2022.
overall, based on the measurement at december 31, 2023, net benefit credits related to the company's defined benefit plans are not expected to be materially different in 2024, compared to 2023, for both the u.s. and non-u.s. plans.
the company's accounting policies for its defined benefit pension plans, including the selection of and sensitivity to assumptions, are discussed in management's discussion of critical accounting estimates. for additional information regarding the company's retirement plans, refer to note 1, summary of significant accounting policies, and note 8, retirement benefits, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
financing cash flows net cash used for financing activities was $1.1 billion in 2023, compared with $1.0 billion used by financing activities in 2022.
credit facilities in october 2023, the company increased its multi-currency unsecured five-year revolving credit facility (the "credit facility") capacity to $3.5 billion from $2.8 billion and extended the expiration to october 2028. the interest rate on the credit facility was initially based on libor plus a fixed margin which varied with the company's credit rating. in the second quarter of 2023, the credit facility was amended that borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal, at the company's option, either at (a) sofr benchmark rate for u.s. dollar borrowings, or (b) a currency specific benchmark rate, plus an applicable margin which varies with the company's credit ratings. the company is required to maintain certain coverage and leverage ratios for the credit facility, which are evaluated quarterly.
the credit facility includes provisions for determining a benchmark replacement rate in the event existing benchmark rates are no longer available or in certain other circumstances, in which an alternative rate may be required. at december 31, 2023 and 2022, the company had no borrowings under this facility.
in october 2023, the company terminated its one-year uncommitted revolving credit facility ("uncommitted credit facility"). there were no borrowings outstanding under the uncommitted credit facility at december 31, 2022.
the company also maintains other credit and overdraft facilities with various financial institutions aggregating $113 million at december 31, 2023, and $362 million at december 31, 2022. there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities at december 31, 2023 and 2022.

contingent payments related to acquisitions the classification of contingent consideration in the consolidated statements of cash flows is dependent upon whether the receipt, payment or adjustment was part of the initial liability established on the acquisition date (financing) or an adjustment to the acquisition date liability (operating).
the following amounts are included in the consolidated statements of cash flows as operating and financing activities:

investing cash flows net cash used for investing activities amounted to $1.4 billion in 2023, compared with $850 million used for investing activities in 2022.
the company paid $976 million and $572 million, net of cash, cash equivalents and cash and cash equivalents held in a fiduciary capacity acquired, for acquisitions in 2023 and 2022, respectively. the outflow of funds in 2023 related primarily to the acquisitions of honan insurance group, graham company and the westpac transaction for $358 million, $307 million, and $232 million, respectively.

the table does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $124 million as the company is unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of these liabilities, other than approximately $49 million that may become payable within one year. the table also does not include the remaining transitional tax payments related to the tax cuts and jobs act ("tcja") of $58 million, which will be paid in installments from 2024 through 2026.
management's discussion of critical accounting estimates management makes estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. management considers the following policies to be critical to understanding the company's financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management's judgment, and requires management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. actual results may differ from those estimates.
revenue recognition in the risk and insurance services segment, management makes judgments related to the amount of variable revenue consideration to ultimately be received on placement of quota share reinsurance treaties and contingent commission from insurers. management also makes judgments and estimates to measure the progress toward completing performance obligations and realization rates for consideration related to contracts as well as potential performance-based fees in the consulting segment.
the company capitalizes the incremental costs to obtain contracts primarily related to commissions or sales bonus payments. these deferred costs are amortized over the expected life of the underlying customer relationships. the company also capitalizes certain pre-placement costs that are considered fulfillment costs that are amortized at a point in time when the associated revenue is recognized.

legal and other loss contingencies the company and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims, lawsuits and proceedings including claims for errors and omissions ("e&o"). the company records a liability when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable which requires significant management judgment. the company utilizes case level reviews by inside and outside counsel, an internal actuarial analysis by oliver wyman group, a subsidiary of the company, and other methods to estimate potential losses. the liability is reviewed quarterly and adjusted based on claims developments. in many cases, the company has not recorded a liability, other than for legal fees to defend the claim, because the company is unable, at present time, to make a determination that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. given the unpredictability of e&o claims and of litigation that could arise from such claims, it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the company's businesses, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows in a given quarterly or annual period.
in addition, to the extent that insurance coverage is available, significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of recoveries that are probable of collection under the company's various insurance programs.
retirement benefits the company maintains qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans for its eligible u.s. employees and a variety of defined benefit and defined contribution plans for its eligible non-u.s. employees. the company's policy for funding its tax-qualified defined benefit retirement plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in the u.s. and applicable foreign laws.
the company recognizes the funded status of its over-funded defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans as a net benefit plan asset and its unfunded and underfunded plans as a net benefit plan liability. the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net benefit (credit) cost are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income ("aoci"), net of tax, in the company's consolidated balance sheets. the gains and losses that exceed specified corridors in accordance with accounting guidance, of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets, are amortized prospectively out of aoci over a period that approximates the remaining life expectancy of participants in plans where substantially all participants are inactive or the average remaining service period of active participants for plans with active participants. the vast majority of unrecognized losses relate to inactive plans and are amortized over the remaining life expectancy of the participants.
the determination of net periodic benefit (credit) cost is based on a number of assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate, mortality and assumed rate of salary increase. the assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic benefit (credit) cost and pension liabilities are disclosed in note 8, retirement benefits, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
the long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption is determined for each plan based on the facts and circumstances that exist as of the measurement date, and the specific portfolio mix of each plan's assets. the company utilizes a model developed by mercer, a subsidiary of the company, to assist in the determination of this assumption. the model takes into account several factors, including: target portfolio allocation, investment, administrative and trading expenses incurred directly by the plan trust, historical portfolio performance, relevant forward-looking economic analysis, and expected returns, variances and correlations for different asset classes. these measures are used to determine probabilities using standard statistical techniques to calculate a range of expected returns on the portfolio.
the target asset allocation for the u.s. plans is 50% equities and equity alternatives and 50% fixed income. at the end of 2023, the actual allocation for the u.s. plans was 49% equities and equity alternatives and 51% fixed income. the target asset allocation for the u.k. plans, which comprise approximately 79% of non-u.s. plan assets, is 14% equities and equity alternatives and 86% fixed income. at the end of 2023, the actual allocation for the u.k. plans was 13% equities and equity alternatives and 87% fixed income.
the discount rate selected for each u.s. plan is based on a model bond portfolio with coupons and redemptions that closely match the expected liability cash flows from the plan. discount rates for non-u.s. plans are based on appropriate bond indices adjusted for duration. in the u.k., the plan duration is reflected using the mercer yield curve.
the following table shows the weighted average assumed rate of return and the discount rate at the december 31, 2023 measurement date used to measure pension expense in 2024 for the total company, the u.s. and the rest of world ("row").

holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.5 percentage point change in the rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions would affect net periodic benefit (credit) cost for the u.s. and u.k. plans, which together comprise approximately 83% of total pension plan liabilities, as follows:
0.5 percentage                          0.5 percentage point increase                          point decrease

the impact of discount rate changes relates to the increase or decrease in actuarial gains or losses being amortized through net periodic benefit (credit) cost, as well as the increase or decrease in interest expense, with all other facts and assumptions held constant. it does not contemplate nor include potential future impacts a change in the interest rate environment and discount rates might cause, such as the impact on the market value of the plans' assets. in addition, the assumed return on plan assets would likely be impacted by changes in the interest rate environment and other factors, including equity valuations, since these factors reflect the starting point used in the company's projection models. for example, a reduction in interest rates may result in a reduction in the assumed return on plan assets. changing the discount rate and leaving the other assumptions constant, may also not be representative of the impact on expense, because the long-term rates of inflation and salary increases are often correlated with the discount rate. changes in these assumptions will not necessarily have a linear impact on the net periodic benefit (credit) cost.
the company contributes to certain health care and life insurance benefits provided to its retired employees. the cost of these post-retirement benefits for employees in the u.s. is accrued during the period up to the date employees are eligible to retire but is funded by the company as incurred. the key assumptions and sensitivity to changes in the assumed health care cost trend rate are discussed in note 8, retirement benefits, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating uncertain tax positions. the company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. the evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process:
•first, the company determines whether it is more-likely-than-not a tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on only the technical merits of the position. if a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements.
•the second step is measurement. a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority. uncertain tax positions are evaluated based upon the facts and circumstances that exist at each reporting period and involve significant management judgment. subsequent changes in judgment based upon new information may lead to changes in recognition, de-recognition, and measurement. adjustments may result, for example, upon resolution of an issue with the taxing authorities, or expiration of a statute of limitations barring an assessment for an issue.
the company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. the company's accounting policy follows the portfolio approach that leaves stranded income tax effects in accumulated other comprehensive income.
certain items are included in the company's tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. as a result, the annual tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income is different than that reported in the tax returns. some of these differences are permanent, such as non-deductible expenses, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense.
temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be settled or realized. deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which cash tax payments have been deferred, or expense for which a deduction has been taken already in the tax return but the expense has not yet been recognized in the financial statements. deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in tax returns in future years for which a benefit has already been recorded in the financial statements.
the company evaluates all significant available positive and negative evidence, including the existence of losses in recent years and its forecast of future taxable income by jurisdiction, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. the company also considers tax planning strategies that would result in realization of deferred tax assets, and the presence of taxable income in prior period tax filings in jurisdictions that allow for the carry back of tax attributes pursuant to the applicable tax law. the underlying assumptions the company uses in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account the company's recent performance. the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences or carry-forwards are deductible or creditable. valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is estimated that it is more-likely-than-not that future taxable income will be insufficient to fully use a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction.
fair value determinations goodwill impairment testing - the company is required to assess goodwill and any indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. the company performs the annual impairment assessment for each of its reporting units during the third quarter of each year. the reporting unit level is defined as the same level as the company's operating segments. in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, a company can assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. alternatively, the company may elect to proceed directly to the quantitative goodwill impairment test.
in 2023, the company performed a quantitative impairment assessment. fair values for the reporting units were estimated using both an income and market valuation approach. carrying values were based on balances at june 30, 2023 and included directly identified assets and liabilities, as well as an allocation of those assets and liabilities not recorded at the reporting unit level.
the company completed its 2023 annual review in the third quarter and concluded that goodwill was not impaired, as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying value.
purchase price allocation assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, as part of a business acquisition are generally recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition. the excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. determining fair value of identifiable assets, particularly intangibles, and liabilities acquired also requires management to make estimates, which are based on all available information and in some cases assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of future revenues and expenses associated with an asset. these estimates directly impact the amount of identified intangible assets recognized and the related amortization expense in future periods.

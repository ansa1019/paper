overview we are the leading off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in the u.s. and worldwide. our mission is to deliver great value to our customers every day. we do this by selling a rapidly changing assortment of apparel, home fashions and other merchandise at prices generally 20% to 60% below full-price retailers' (including department, specialty, and major online retailers) regular prices on comparable merchandise, every day through our stores and six e-commerce sites. we operate over 4,900 stores through our four main segments: in the u.s., marmaxx (which operates tj maxx, marshalls, tjmaxx.com and marshalls.com) and homegoods (which operates homegoods, and homesense); tjx canada (which operates winners, homesense and marshalls in canada); and tjx international (which operates tk maxx, homesense, tkmaxx.com, tkmaxx.de, and tkmaxx.at in europe, and tk maxx in australia). in addition to our four main segments, sierra operates retail stores and sierra.com in the u.s. the results of sierra are included in the marmaxx segment.
results of operations highlights of our financial performance for fiscal 2024 include the following:
-net sales increased 9% to $54.2 billion for fiscal 2024 versus $49.9 billion for fiscal 2023. the 53rd week in fiscal 2024 increased net sales by an estimated 2%. as of february 3, 2024, the number of stores in operation increased approximately 2% and selling square footage increased approximately 3% compared to the end of fiscal 2023.
-consolidated comp store sales increased 5% in fiscal 2024. see net sales below for the definition of comp store sales.
-diluted earnings per share were $3.86 for fiscal 2024, which included an estimated benefit of $0.10 from the 53rd week in fiscal 2024, compared to $2.97 for fiscal 2023, which included a $0.14 net of tax charge related to the write-down and the divestiture of our minority investment in familia.
-pre-tax profit margin (the ratio of pre-tax income to net sales) for fiscal 2024 was 11.0%, which included an estimated 0.1 percentage point benefit from the 53rd week in fiscal 2024. this was a 1.7 percentage point increase compared to 9.3% for fiscal 2023, which included a 0.4 percentage point charge related to the write-down of our minority investment in familia.
-our cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, ratio for fiscal 2024 was 70.0%, a 2.4 percentage point decrease compared to 72.4% for fiscal 2023.
-our selling, general and administrative ("sg&a") expense ratio for fiscal 2024 was 19.3%, a 1.4 percentage point increase compared to 17.9% for fiscal 2023.
-our consolidated average per store inventories, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers (which excludes inventory in transit) and excluding our e-commerce sites and sierra stores, were up 1% on both a reported basis and constant currency basis at the end of fiscal 2024 as compared to the prior year.
-during fiscal 2024, we returned $4.0 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. a dividend of $0.3325 per share was declared in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 and paid in march 2024.

net sales net sales for fiscal 2024 totaled $54.2 billion, a 9% increase versus net sales of $49.9 billion for fiscal 2023. the increase includes a 5% increase in comp store sales, a 2% increase from the estimated impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2024, a 2% increase from non-comp store sales and a neutral impact from foreign currency exchange rates. net sales from our e-commerce sites combined amounted to less than 2% of total sales for both fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023.
for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024, we have returned to our historical definition of comparable store sales (as defined below). while stores in the u.s. were open for all of fiscal 2022, a significant number of stores in tjx canada and tjx international experienced covid-related temporary store closures and government-mandated shopping restrictions during fiscal 2022. therefore, in fiscal 2023, we could not measure year-over-year comparable store sales with fiscal 2022 in these geographies in a meaningful way. as a result, the comparable stores included in the fiscal 2023 measure consisted of u.s. stores only, which, for clarity, we referred to as u.s. comparable store sales ("u.s. comp store sales"), and were calculated against sales for the comparable period in fiscal 2022.
comp store sales increased 5% for fiscal 2024. u.s. comp store sales were flat for fiscal 2023. comp store sales for fiscal 2024 was driven by an increase in customer transactions. apparel comp store sales growth (as defined below) outperformed home comp store sales growth (as defined below) for fiscal 2024.
as of february 3, 2024, our store count increased approximately 2% and selling square footage increased approximately 3% compared to the same period last year.
definition of comparable store sales we define comparable store sales, or comp store sales, to be sales of stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years, or in other words, stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation. we calculate comp store sales on a 52-week basis by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned. relocated stores and stores that have changed in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store, and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated comp store sales percentage is immaterial.
sales excluded from comp store sales ("non-comp store sales") consist of sales from:
-new stores - stores that have not yet met the comp store sales criteria, which represents a substantial majority of non-comp store sales
-stores that are closed permanently or for an extended period of time
-sales from our e-commerce sites we determine which stores are included in the comp store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year unless a store is closed permanently or for an extended period during that fiscal year.
comp store sales of our foreign segments are calculated by translating the current year's comp store sales using the prior year's exchange rates. this removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, which we believe is a more accurate measure of segment operating performance.
comp store sales may be referred to as "same store" sales by other retail companies. the method for calculating comp store sales varies across the retail industry; therefore, our measure of comp store sales may not be comparable to that of other retail companies. comparable store sales for a category such as home or apparel include sales from merchandise within such category combined across all divisions at the stores that fall within the company's definition of comparable stores for such period.
historically, we defined customer traffic to be the number of transactions in stores included in the comp store sales calculation; going forward we refer to this as customer transactions. we define average ticket to be the average retail price of the units sold. we define average basket to be the average dollar value of transactions.

impact of foreign currency exchange rates our operating results are affected by foreign currency exchange rates as a result of changes in the value of the u.s. dollar or a division's local currency in relation to other currencies. we specifically refer to "foreign currency" as the impact of translational foreign currency exchange and mark-to-market of inventory derivatives, as described in detail below. this does not include the impact foreign currency exchange rates can have on various transactions that are denominated in a currency other than an operating division's local currency, which is referred to as "transactional foreign exchange," and also described below.
translation foreign exchange in our consolidated financial statements, we translate the operations of tjx canada and tjx international from local currencies into u.s. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time. significant changes in foreign exchange rates between comparable prior periods can result in meaningful variations in assets, liabilities, net sales, net income and earnings per share as well as the net sales and operating results of these segments. currency translation generally does not affect operating margins, or affects them only slightly, as sales and expenses of the foreign operations are translated at approximately the same rates within a given period.
mark-to-market inventory derivatives we routinely enter into inventory-related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact on earnings of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise purchases denominated in currencies other than the local currencies of our divisions, principally tjx canada and tjx international. as we have not elected "hedge accounting" for these instruments, as defined by u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"), we record a mark-to-market gain or loss on the derivative instruments in our results of operations at the end of each reporting period. in subsequent periods, the income statement impact of the mark-to-market adjustment is effectively offset when the inventory being hedged is paid for. while these effects occur every reporting period, they are of much greater magnitude when there are sudden and significant changes in currency exchange rates during a short period of time. the mark-to-market adjustment on these derivatives does not affect net sales, but it does affect the cost of sales, operating margins and earnings we report.
transactional foreign exchange when discussing the impact on our results of the effect of foreign currency exchange rates on certain transactions, we refer to it as "transactional foreign exchange". this primarily includes the impact that foreign currency exchange rates may have on the year-over-year comparison of merchandise margin as well as "foreign currency gains and losses" on transactions that are denominated in a currency other than the operating division's local currency. these two items can impact segment margin comparison of our foreign divisions and we have highlighted them when they are meaningful to understanding operating trends.
cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales was 70.0% for fiscal 2024, a decrease of 2.4 percentage points compared to 72.4% of net sales for fiscal 2023.
30
the decrease in the cost of sales ratio, including buying and occupancy costs, was primarily attributable to higher merchandise margin due to lower freight costs.
selling, general and administrative expenses sg&a expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 19.3% for fiscal 2024, an increase of 1.4 percentage points compared to 17.9% for fiscal 2023.
the increase in sg&a ratio for fiscal 2024 was attributable to higher incentive compensation costs and incremental store wage and payroll costs. in addition, this increase reflects a reserve related to a german government covid program receivable, costs related to the closing of our homegoods e-commerce business and a contribution to our u.s. charitable foundation.
impairment on equity investment during fiscal 2023, we announced and completed the divestiture of our minority investment in familia. as a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $218 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 representing the entire carrying value of the investment. additionally, we realized a $54 million tax benefit when we completed the divestiture of this investment during the third quarter of fiscal 2023.

the change in interest (income) expense, net for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 was due to an increase in interest income driven by an increase in prevailing rates and a higher average cash balance.
provision for income taxes in 2021, the organization for economic co-operation and development announced an inclusive framework on base erosion and profit shifting including pillar two model rules defining the global minimum tax, which calls for the taxation of large multinational corporations at a minimum rate of 15%. subsequently multiple sets of administrative guidance have been issued. many non-us tax jurisdictions have either recently enacted legislation to adopt certain components of the pillar two model rules beginning in 2024 with the adoption of additional components in later years or announced their plans to enact legislation in future years. considering we do not have material operations in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the pillar two minimum, these rules are not expected to materially increase our global tax costs. there remains uncertainty as to the final pillar two model rules. we are continuing to evaluate the impacts of enacted legislation and pending legislation to enact pillar two model rules in the non-us tax jurisdictions we operate in.
in august 2022, the inflation reduction act of 2022 ("ira"), was signed into law. among other things, the ira imposes a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (the "corporate amt") for tax years beginning after december 31, 2022 and levies a 1% excise tax on net stock repurchases after december 31, 2022. the excise tax on the net stock repurchase, corporate amt, or other provisions of the ira did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position in fiscal 2024 or fiscal 2023.
the effective income tax rate was 25.0% for fiscal 2024 compared to 24.5% for fiscal 2023. the increase in the fiscal 2024 effective income tax rate is primarily due to an increase of nondeductible items and a reduction of excess tax benefits from share-based compensation.
net income and diluted earnings per share net income was $4.5 billion in fiscal 2024 compared to $3.5 billion in fiscal 2023. diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2024 were $3.86 compared to $2.97 in fiscal 2023. the 53rd week in fiscal 2024 provided an estimated benefit of $0.10 per share. the $218 million impairment on our previously-held minority investment in familia, net of the $54 million tax benefit, had a $0.14 negative impact on diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2023. foreign currency had a neutral impact on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2024 compared to a 0.06 negative impact on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2023.
segment information we operate four main business segments. in the united states, our marmaxx segment operates tj maxx, marshalls, tjmaxx.com and marshalls.com and our homegoods segment operates homegoods and homesense. our tjx canada segment operates winners, homesense and marshalls in canada, and our tjx international segment operates tk maxx, homesense, tkmaxx.com, tkmaxx.de, and tkmaxx.at in europe and tk maxx in australia. in addition to our four main segments, sierra operates retail stores and sierra.com in the u.s. the results of sierra are included in the marmaxx segment.
we evaluate the performance of our segments based on "segment profit or loss," which we define as pre-tax income or loss before general corporate expense and interest (income) expense, net, and certain separately disclosed unusual or infrequent items. "segment profit or loss," as we define the term, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. the terms "segment margin" or "segment profit margin" are used to describe segment profit or loss as a percentage of net sales. these measures of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity.

net sales net sales for marmaxx were $33.4 billion for fiscal 2024, an increase of 9% compared to $30.5 billion for fiscal 2023. the increase in net sales reflects a 6% increase from comp store sales, a 2% increase from the estimated impact of the 53rd week and a 1% increase from non-comp store sales.
the increase in comp store sales for fiscal 2024 was driven by an increase in customer transactions. for fiscal 2024, marmaxx had strong home and apparel comp store sales growth. all geographies generally performed in line with the overall comp store sales increase.
segment profit margin segment profit margin increased to 13.8% for fiscal 2024 compared to a segment profit margin of 12.7% for fiscal 2023. the increase in segment profit margin was primarily driven by higher merchandise margin, partially offset by incremental store wage and payroll costs and higher incentive compensation costs. merchandise margin reflects lower freight costs and higher markon.
our marmaxx e-commerce sites, tjmaxx.com and marshalls.com, together with sierra.com, represented less than 3% of marmaxx's net sales for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 and did not have a significant impact on year-over-year segment margin comparisons.
in fiscal 2025, we expect to add approximately 45 marmaxx net new stores and 26 new sierra stores, which would increase selling square footage by approximately 2%.

net sales net sales for homegoods were $9.0 billion for fiscal 2024, an increase of 9%, compared to $8.3 billion for fiscal 2023. the increase in net sales reflects a 4% increase from non-comp store sales, a 3% increase from comp store sales and a 2% increase from the estimated impact of the 53rd week.
the increase in comp store sales for fiscal 2024 reflected an increase in customer transactions, partially offset by a decrease in average basket. all geographies performed in line with the overall comp store sales increase.
segment profit margin segment profit margin increased to 9.6% for fiscal 2024 compared to a segment profit margin of 6.3% for fiscal 2023. the increase in segment profit margin for fiscal 2024 was primarily driven by higher merchandise margin, due to lower freight costs, partially offset by incremental store wage and payroll costs, costs related to the closing of our homegoods e-commerce business and higher incentive compensation costs.
in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we closed our homegoods e-commerce business on homegoods.com, which represented less than 1% of homegoods net sales for both fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023.
in fiscal 2025, we expect to add approximately 40 homegoods stores, of which 17 are expected to be homesense stores. this would increase selling square footage by approximately 4%.

(a)comp store sales reported for fiscal 2024 and was not applicable for fiscal 2023.
net sales net sales for tjx canada were $5.0 billion for fiscal 2024, an increase of 3% compared to $4.9 billion for fiscal 2023. the increase in net sales reflects a 3% increase in comp store sales, a 2% increase from the estimated impact of the 53rd week and a 1% increase in non-comp store sales, partially offset by a negative foreign currency exchange rate impact of 3%. the increase in comp store sales was driven by an increase in customer transactions, partially offset by a decrease in average basket.
segment profit margin segment profit margin increased to 14.2% for fiscal 2024 compared to a segment profit margin of 14.0% for fiscal 2023. the increase for fiscal 2024 was primarily driven by favorable supply chain costs and higher merchandise margin, partially offset by a prior year release of a covid wage subsidy reserve, higher incentive compensation and administrative costs. merchandise margin reflects lower freight costs, partially offset by lower markon and higher markdowns.
in fiscal 2025, we expect to add approximately 10 stores in canada, which would increase selling square footage by approximately 2%.

(a)comp store sales reported for fiscal 2024 and was not applicable for fiscal 2023.
net sales net sales for tjx international were $6.8 billion for fiscal 2024, an increase of 9% compared to $6.2 billion for fiscal 2023. the increase in net sales reflects a 3% increase in comp store sales, a positive foreign currency exchange rate impact of 3%, a 2% increase from the estimated impact of the 53rd week and a 1% increase from non-comp store sales. the increase in comp store sales was driven by an increase in customer transactions.
e-commerce sales were approximately 3% of tjx international's net sales for both fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023. in addition to tkmaxx.com, during the second quarter of fiscal 2024, tjx international made online shopping available in germany at tkmaxx.de and in austria at tkmaxx.at.
segment profit margin segment profit margin decreased to 4.9% for fiscal 2024 compared to a segment profit margin of 5.6% for fiscal 2023. this decrease was due to a reserve related to a german government covid program receivable, higher incentive compensation and administrative costs and incremental store wage, partially offset by higher merchandise margin. merchandise margin reflects lower freight costs and higher markon.
in fiscal 2025, we expect to add approximately 15 net new stores in europe and approximately 5 net new stores in australia, which would increase selling square footage by approximately 2%.

general corporate expense        $708              $582
general corporate expense for segment reporting purposes represents those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments. general corporate expenses are primarily included in sg&a expenses. the mark-to-market adjustment of our fuel and inventory hedges is included in cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs.
the increase in general corporate expense for fiscal 2024 was primarily driven by higher incentive and share-based compensation costs and a contribution to tjx's u.s. charitable foundation.

analysis of financial condition liquidity and capital resources our liquidity requirements have traditionally been funded through cash generated from operations, supplemented, as needed, by short-term bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper. as of february 3, 2024, there were no short-term bank borrowings or commercial paper outstanding. we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, internally generated funds and our credit facilities, under which facilities we have $1.5 billion available as of the period ended february 3, 2024, as described in note j-long-term debt and credit lines of notes to consolidated financial statements, are adequate to meet our operating needs for the foreseeable future.
as of february 3, 2024, we held $5.6 billion in cash. approximately $1.4 billion of our cash was held by our foreign subsidiaries with $804 million held in countries where we intend to indefinitely reinvest any undistributed earnings. we have provided for all applicable state and foreign withholding taxes on all undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries in canada, puerto rico, italy, india, hong kong and vietnam through february 3, 2024. if we repatriate cash from such subsidiaries, we should not incur additional tax expense and our cash would be reduced by the amount of withholding taxes paid.
we monitor debt financing markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may incur additional long-term indebtedness depending on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, existing economic conditions and other factors. in fiscal 2024, we have used, and in the future we may continue to use, operating cash flow and cash on hand to repay portions of our indebtedness, depending on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, existing economic conditions, contractual restrictions and other factors. as such, we may, from time to time, seek to retire, redeem, prepay or purchase our outstanding debt through redemptions, cash purchases, prepayments, refinancings and/or exchanges, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. if we use our operating cash flow and/or cash on hand to repay our debt, it will reduce the amount of cash available for additional capital expenditures.
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was $6.1 billion in fiscal 2024 and $4.1 billion in fiscal 2023. our operating cash flows increased by $2 billion compared to fiscal 2023 primarily due to a $1 billion increase in net income, a $466 million increase in accrued expenses reflecting higher incentive compensation costs and a $461 million change in merchandise inventories net of accounts payable.
investing activities investing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $1.7 billion in fiscal 2024 and $1.5 billion in fiscal 2023. the cash outflows for both periods were primarily driven by capital expenditures.
net cash used in investing activities include capital expenditures for the last two fiscal years as set forth in the table below:

total capital expenditures                   $1,722            $1,457
we expect our capital expenditures in fiscal 2025 will be in the range of approximately $2.0 billion to $2.1 billion, including approximately $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion for our offices and distribution centers (including buying and merchandising systems and other information systems) to support growth, approximately $0.8 billion for store renovations and approximately $0.2 billion for new stores. we plan to fund these expenditures with our existing cash balances and through internally generated funds.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $4.2 billion in fiscal 2024 compared to net cash outflows of $3.3 billion in fiscal 2023. the cash outflows for both periods were primarily driven by equity repurchases and dividend payments. additionally, fiscal 2024 included a $500 million debt repayment upon maturity.
debt the cash outflows in fiscal 2024 were due to the repayment of our $500 million 2.500% ten-year notes due may 2023 during the second quarter of fiscal 2024, upon maturity. see note j-long-term debt and credit lines of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
equity under our stock repurchase program, we paid $2.5 billion to repurchase and retire 29.0 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2024. we paid $2.3 billion to repurchase and retire 34.9 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2023.
in february 2024, we announced that our board of directors had approved a new stock repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to an additional $2.5 billion of our common stock from time to time. we currently plan to repurchase approximately $2 billion to $2.5 billion of stock under our stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2025. we determine the timing and amount of repurchases based on our assessment of various factors including excess cash flow, liquidity, economic and market conditions, our assessment of prospects for our business, legal requirements, and other factors. the timing and amount of these purchases may change. as of february 3, 2024, approximately $3.5 billion remained available under our existing stock repurchase programs. for further information regarding equity repurchases, see note d-capital stock and earnings per share of notes to consolidated financial statements.
the ira levies a 1% excise tax on net stock repurchases after december 31, 2022. beginning on january 1, 2023, these purchases are subject to the excise tax. the excise tax on the net stock repurchase portion of the ira did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position in fiscal 2024 or fiscal 2023. see note k-income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
dividends we declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled $1.33 per share in fiscal 2024 and $1.18 per share in fiscal 2023. cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled $1.5 billion for fiscal 2024 and $1.3 billion for fiscal 2023. we expect to pay quarterly dividends for fiscal 2025 of $0.375 per share, or an annual dividend of $1.50 per share, subject to the declaration and approval by our board of directors. this would represent a 13% increase over the per share dividends declared and paid in fiscal 2024.
contractual obligations see the descriptions of our financing arrangements, commitments and contingencies, and contractual obligations outlined below and within the following notes to consolidated financial statements.
-see note j-long-term debt and credit lines of notes to consolidated financial statements for future payments under long-term debt arrangements (including current installments).
-see note l-leases of notes to consolidated financial statements. operating lease liabilities exclude legally binding minimum lease payments for approximately 170 leases signed but not yet commenced and include options to extend lease terms that are now deemed reasonably certain of being exercised according to our lease accounting policy. the balances do not include variable costs for insurance, real estate taxes, other operating expenses and, in some cases, rent payments based on a percentage of sales; these items totaled approximately one-third of the total minimum rent for fiscal 2024.
-see note m-accrued expenses and other liabilities, current and long term of notes to consolidated financial statements for long-term liabilities for which it is not reasonably possible for us to predict when they may be paid, which includes $0.6 billion for employee compensation and benefits and $0.2 billion for uncertain tax positions.
-we also have non-cancellable purchase obligations under purchase orders for merchandise and under agreements for capital items, products and services used in our business, including executive employment and other agreements.
critical accounting estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap which requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that impact our reported results. these judgments and estimates are based on historical experience and other factors which we continually review and believe are reasonable. we consider our most critical accounting estimates, involving uncertainty requiring management estimates and judgments, to be those relating to the areas described below.
inventory valuation we use the retail method for valuing inventory for all our businesses except tk maxx in australia. the businesses that utilize the retail method have some inventory that is initially valued at cost before the retail method is applied as it has not been fully processed for sale (i.e. inventory in transit and unprocessed inventory in our distribution centers). under the retail method, the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a cost-to-retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory. it involves management estimates with regard to markdowns and inventory shrinkage. under the retail method, permanent markdowns are reflected in inventory valuation when the price of an item is reduced. we have a specific policy as to when and how markdowns are to be taken, greatly reducing management's discretion and the need for management estimates as to markdowns. inventory shrinkage requires estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods; however, we take a full physical inventory near the fiscal year-end to determine shrinkage at year-end. we do not generally enter into arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances that could ultimately affect the value of inventory.
reserves for uncertain tax positions similar to many large corporations, our income and other tax returns and reports are regularly audited by federal, state and local tax authorities in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions where we operate, and such authorities may challenge positions we take. we are engaged in various administrative and judicial proceedings in multiple jurisdictions with respect to assessments, claims, deficiencies and refunds and other tax matters, which proceedings are in various stages of negotiation, assessment, examination, litigation and settlement. the outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain. in accordance with gaap, we evaluate our uncertain tax positions based on our understanding of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date, and we accrue for exposure when we believe that it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the positions we have taken will not be sustained. however, in the next twelve months and in future periods, the amounts we accrue for uncertain tax positions from time to time or ultimately pay, as the result of the final resolutions of examinations, judicial or administrative proceedings, changes in facts, law, or legal interpretations, expiration of applicable statute of limitations or other resolutions of, or changes in, tax positions may differ either positively or negatively from the amounts we have accrued, and may result in reductions to or additions to accruals, refund claims or payments for periods not currently under examination or for which no claims have been made. final resolutions of our tax positions or changes in accruals for uncertain tax positions could result in additional tax expense or benefit and could have a material impact on our results of operations of the period in which an examination or proceeding is resolved or in the period in which a changed outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.
loss contingencies certain conditions may exist as of the date the consolidated financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to us but will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur. our management, with the assistance of our legal counsel, assesses such contingent liabilities. such assessments inherently involve the exercise of judgment. in assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or claims that may result in such proceedings, our legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein.
if the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, we will accrue for the estimated liability in the consolidated financial statements. if the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be reasonably estimated, we will disclose the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not reasonably estimable.
recent accounting pronouncements for a discussion of any new accounting pronouncements, see note a-basis of presentation and summary of accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k, including the dates of adoption and estimated effects on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. we do not expect any other recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

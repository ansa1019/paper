item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we begin management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations with an overview of our businesses and significant trends. this overview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. we then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. a discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 can be found in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii, item 7 of our annual report on form 10-k for the fiscal year ended may 31, 2022, as filed with the sec on june 21, 2022, which is available free of charge on the sec's website at www.sec.gov and on our investor relations website at www.oracle.com/investor.
business overview oracle provides products and services that address enterprise information technology (it) environments. our products and services include enterprise applications and infrastructure offerings that are delivered worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable it deployment models. these models include on-premise, cloud-based and hybrid deployments (an approach that combines both on-premise and cloud-based deployments). accordingly, we offer choice and flexibility to our customers and facilitate the product, service and deployment combinations that best suit our customers' needs. through our worldwide sales force and oracle partner network, we sell to customers all over the world including businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers.
we have three businesses: cloud and license; hardware; and services; each of which comprises a single operating segment. the descriptions set forth below as a part of this item 7 management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the information contained within item 1 business and note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report provide additional information related to our businesses and operating segments and align to how our chief operating decision makers (codms), which include our chief executive officer and chief technology officer, view our operating results and allocate resources.
cloud and license business our cloud and license business, which represented 83% and 85% of our total revenues in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, markets, sells and delivers a broad spectrum of enterprise applications and infrastructure technologies through our cloud and license offerings. revenue streams included in our cloud and license business are:
•cloud services and license support revenues, which include:
olicense support revenues, which are earned by providing oracle license support services to customers that have elected to purchase support services in connection with the purchase of oracle applications and infrastructure licenses for use in cloud, on-premise and other it environments. substantially all license support customers renew their support contracts with us upon expiration in order to continue to benefit from technical support services and the periodic issuance of unspecified updates and enhancements, which current license support customers are entitled to receive. license support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to purchase a cloud license and/or on-premise license; are generally billed in advance of the support services being performed; are generally renewed at the customer's option; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period that the support services are provided, which is generally one year; and ocloud services revenues, which are earned by providing customers access to oracle cloud applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud-based deployment models that oracle develops, provides unspecified updates and enhancements for, deploys, hosts, manages and supports and that customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period. oracle cloud services arrangements are generally billed in advance of the cloud services being performed; generally have durations of one to three years; are generally renewed at the customer's option; and are generally index to financial statements recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period of the cloud contract or, in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed over time.
•cloud license and on-premise license revenues, which include revenues from the licensing of our software products including oracle applications, oracle database, oracle middleware and java, among others, which our customers deploy within cloud-based, on-premise or other it environments. our cloud license and on-premise license transactions are generally perpetual in nature and are generally recognized as revenues up front at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use. revenues from usage-based royalty arrangements for distinct cloud licenses and on-premise licenses are recognized at the point in time when the software end user usage occurs. the timing of a few large license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly license revenues due to the point-in-time nature of revenue recognition for license transactions, which is different than the typical revenue recognition pattern for our cloud services and license support revenues in which revenues are generally recognized ratably over the contractual terms. cloud license and on-premise license customers have the option to purchase and renew license support contracts, as further described above.
providing choice and flexibility to our customers as to when and how they deploy oracle applications and infrastructure technologies are important elements of our corporate strategy. in recent periods, customer demand for our applications and infrastructure technologies delivered through our oracle cloud services has increased. to address customer demand and enable customer choice, we have introduced certain programs for customers to pivot their applications and infrastructure licenses and the related license support to the oracle cloud for new deployments and to migrate to and expand with the oracle cloud for their existing workloads. the proportion of our cloud services revenues relative to our total revenues has increased and we expect this trend to continue. cloud services revenues represented 32%, 25% and 22% of our total revenues during fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
our cloud and license business' revenue growth is affected by many factors, including the strength of general economic and business conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; the strategy for and competitive position of our offerings; customer satisfaction with our offerings; the continued renewal of our cloud services and license support customer contracts by the customer contract base; substantially all customers continuing to purchase license support contracts in connection with their license purchases; the pricing of license support contracts sold in connection with the sales of licenses; the pricing, amounts and volumes of licenses and cloud services sold; our ability to manage oracle cloud capacity requirements to meet existing and prospective customer demand; and foreign currency rate fluctuations.
on a constant currency basis, we expect that our total cloud and license revenues generally will continue to increase due to:
•expected growth in our cloud services and license support offerings; and
•continued demand for our cloud license and on-premise license offerings.
we believe these factors should contribute to future growth in our cloud and license business' total revenues, which should enable us to continue to make investments in research and development and our cloud operations to develop, improve, increase the capacity of and expand the geographic footprint of our cloud and license products and services.
our cloud and license business' margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our cloud and license business' revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this business are generally fixed in the short term. the historical upward trend of our cloud and license business' revenues over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year is primarily due to the addition of new cloud services and license support contracts to the customer contract base that we generally recognize as revenues ratably or based upon customer usage over the respective contractual terms and the renewal of existing customers' cloud services and license support contracts over the course of each fiscal year that we generally recognize as revenues in a similar manner; and the historical index to financial statements upward trend of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues, which we generally recognize at a point in time upon delivery; in each case over those four fiscal quarterly periods.
hardware business our hardware business, which represented 6% and 7% of our total revenues in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, provides a broad selection of enterprise hardware products and hardware-related software products including oracle engineered systems, servers, storage, industry-specific hardware offerings, operating systems, virtualization, management and other hardware-related software, and related hardware support. each hardware product and its related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. the revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product and its related software are delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer. we expect to make investments in research and development to improve existing hardware products and services and to develop new hardware products and services. the majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels, including independent distributors and value-added resellers. our hardware support offerings provide customers with unspecified software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products and associated software products. our hardware support offerings can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. hardware support contracts are entered into and renewed at the option of the customer, are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees and are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual terms.
we generally expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our cloud and license business due to the incremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services, including direct materials and labor costs.
our quarterly hardware revenues are difficult to predict. our hardware revenues, cost of hardware and hardware operating margins that we report are affected by many factors, including our manufacturing partners' abilities to timely manufacture or deliver a few large hardware transactions, with this factor becoming more pronounced in recent periods due to global supply chain constraints for certain technology components; our strategy for and the position of our hardware products relative to competitor offerings; customer demand for competing offerings, including cloud infrastructure offerings; the strength of general economic and business conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; whether customers decide to purchase hardware support contracts at or in close proximity to the time of hardware product sale; the percentage of our hardware support contract customer base that renews its support contracts; and the close association between hardware products, which have a finite life, and customer demand for related hardware support as hardware products age; customer decisions to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available; and foreign currency rate fluctuations.
services business our services business, which represented 11% and 8% of our total revenues in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, helps customers and partners maximize the performance of their investments in oracle applications and infrastructure technologies. we believe that our services are differentiated based on our focus on oracle technologies, extensive experience, broad sets of intellectual property and best practices. our services offerings include consulting services and advanced customer services. our services business has lower margins than our cloud and license and hardware businesses. our services revenues are affected by many factors including our strategy for, and the competitive position of, our services; customer demand for our cloud and license and hardware offerings and the related services that we may market and sell in connection with these offerings; general economic conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; personnel reductions in our customers' it departments; tighter controls over customer discretionary spending; and foreign currency rate fluctuations.
index to financial statements acquisitions our selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. historically, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies, products, services and technologies. we acquired certain companies and technologies during fiscal 2023 and 2022, including cerner in fiscal 2023. refer to note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information related to our acquisition of cerner and our other recent acquisitions. as compelling opportunities become available, we may acquire companies, products, services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy.
we believe that we can fund our future acquisitions with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. we estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash flows and return on invested capital targets, among others, before deciding to move forward with an acquisition.
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) as set forth in the financial accounting standards board's accounting standards codification (asc), and we consider various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the sec. gaap, as set forth within the asc, requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. we believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. these estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. to the extent that there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include:
•revenue recognition;
•business combinations;
•goodwill and intangible assets-impairment assessments;
•accounting for income taxes; and
•legal and other contingencies.
our senior management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the finance and audit committee of the board of directors. refer to note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for more discussion of our critical and other accounting policies. there were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from the prior year.
revenue recognition the most critical judgments required in applying asc 606, revenue recognition from customers, and our revenue recognition policy relate to the determination of distinct performance obligations and the evaluation of the standalone selling price (ssp) for each performance obligation.
many of our customer contracts include multiple performance obligations. judgment is required in determining whether each performance obligation within a customer contract is distinct. oracle products and services generally function on a standalone basis and do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency. therefore, multiple products and services contained within a customer contract are generally considered to be distinct and are not combined for revenue recognition purposes. we allocate the transaction price for each customer contract to each performance obligation based on the relative ssp (the determination of ssp is discussed below) for each index to financial statements performance obligation within each contract. we recognize the amount of transaction price allocated to each performance obligation within a customer contract as revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied.
we use historical sales transaction data and judgment, among other factors, in determining the ssp for products and services. for substantially all performance obligations except cloud licenses and on-premise licenses, we are able to establish the ssp based on the observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. we typically establish an ssp range for our products and services, which is reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change. ssp for our products and services can evolve over time due to changes in our pricing practices that are influenced by intense competition, changes in demand for our products and services, and economic factors, among others. our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses have not historically been sold on a standalone basis, as substantially all customers elect to purchase license support contracts at the time of a license purchase. license support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to purchase the license. we are unable to establish the ssp for our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses based on observable prices given the same products are sold for a broad range of amounts (that is, the selling price is highly variable) and a representative ssp is not discernible from past transactions or other observable evidence. as a result, the ssp for a cloud license and an on-premise license included in a contract with multiple performance obligations is generally determined by applying a residual approach whereby all other performance obligations within a contract are first allocated a portion of the transaction price based upon their respective ssps, with any residual amount of transaction price allocated to cloud license and on-premise license revenues.
business combinations we apply the provisions of asc 805, business combinations (asc 805), in accounting for our acquisitions. asc 805 requires that we evaluate whether a transaction pertains to an acquisition of assets, or to an acquisition of a business. a business is defined as an integrated set of assets and activities that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. asset acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the individual assets and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis; whereas the acquisition of a business requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values. goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. while we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. as a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. upon the conclusion of a business acquisition's measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations.
accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, including our estimates for intangible assets, pre-acquisition contingencies and any contingent consideration, where applicable. although we believe that the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.
for a given business acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts.
if we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a non-income tax related pre-acquisition contingency by the end of the measurement period, which is generally the case given the nature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (1) it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and (2) the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. subsequent index to financial statements to the measurement period or final determination of the net asset values for the business combination, whichever comes first, changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position.
in addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. we reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance's or contingency's estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.
goodwill and intangible assets-impairment assessments we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable. we make certain judgments and assumptions to determine our reporting units and in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units.
judgment in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairment include cost factors; financial performance; legal, regulatory, contractual, political, business, and other factors; entity specific factors; industry and market considerations, macroeconomic conditions, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. to the extent we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed.
performing a quantitative goodwill impairment test includes the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and involves significant estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions include, among others, revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and the determination of appropriate market comparables.
we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. in such situations, we are required to evaluate whether the net book values of our finite lived intangible assets are recoverable. we determine whether finite lived intangible assets are recoverable based upon the forecasted future cash flows that are expected to be generated by the lowest level associated asset grouping. assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are complex and subjective and include, among others, forecasted undiscounted cash flows to be generated by certain asset groupings. these assumptions and estimates can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts.
accounting for income taxes judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. in the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities, the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment, and the segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation. although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made.
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. we consider future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining index to financial statements the need for a valuation allowance. in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination, or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period. if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to our provision for income taxes at such time.
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known, which can materially impact our effective tax rate.
the amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue may require certain judgments. a description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under "business combinations" above.
for those tax related contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we account for these uncertain tax issues pursuant to asc 740, income taxes, which contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. the first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters. we adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, judicial rulings, and refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates. to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences generally will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made. our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties.
legal and other contingencies we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. a description of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under "business combinations" above. for legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable. because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time the accruals are made. as additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.
index to financial statements results of operations impact of acquisitions the comparability of our operating results for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 was impacted by our recent acquisitions, including cerner. in our discussion of changes in our results of operations for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, we have qualitatively disclosed the impact of our acquired products and services subsequent to the acquisition date to the growth in operating segments' revenues where such qualitative discussions would be meaningful for an understanding of the factors that influenced the changes in our results of operations. when material, we have also provided quantitative disclosures related to such acquired products and services. the impacts of expense contributions from our recent acquisitions subsequent to the acquisition dates generally were not separately identifiable due to the integration of these businesses and operating segments into our existing operations, and/or were insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented.
presentation of operating segment results and other financial information in our results of operations discussion below, we provide an overview of our total consolidated revenues, total consolidated operating expenses and total consolidated operating margin, all of which are presented on a gaap basis. we also present a gaap-based discussion below for substantially all of the other expense items as presented in our consolidated statements of operations that are not directly attributable to our three businesses.
in addition, we discuss below the results of each of our three businesses-cloud and license, hardware and services-which are our operating segments as defined pursuant to asc 280, segment reporting. the financial reporting for our three businesses that is presented below is presented in a manner that is consistent with that used by our codms. our operating segment presentation below reflects revenues, direct costs and sales and marketing expenses that correspond to and are directly attributable to each of our three businesses. we also utilize these inputs to calculate and present a segment margin for each of our three businesses in the discussion below.
consistent with our internal management reporting processes, research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets, certain other expense allocations, acquisition related and other expenses, restructuring expenses, interest expense, non-operating expenses, net and provision for income taxes are not attributed to our three operating segments because our management does not view the performance of our three businesses including such items and/or it is impracticable to do so. refer to "supplemental disclosure related to certain charges" below for additional discussion of certain of these items and note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for a reconciliation of the summations of total segment margin as presented in the discussion below to total income before income taxes as presented per our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2023 and 2022.
during fiscal 2022, we remitted and recorded $4.7 billion for certain litigation related items that we do not expect to recur in future periods.
constant currency presentation our international operations have provided and are expected to continue to provide a significant portion of each of our businesses' revenues and expenses. as a result, each of our businesses' revenues and expenses and our total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the u.s. dollar against major international currencies. in order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this annual report using constant currency disclosure. to present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than u.s. dollars are converted into u.s. dollars at constant exchange rates (i.e., the rates in effect on may 31, 2022, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year) rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. for example, if an entity reporting in euros had revenues of 1.0 million euros from products sold on may 31, 2023 and 2022, our financial statements would reflect reported revenues of $1.08 million in fiscal 2023 (using 1.08 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period) and $1.07 million in fiscal 2022 (using 1.07 as the month-end average exchange rate for the period).
index to financial statements the constant currency presentation, however, would translate the fiscal 2023 results using the fiscal 2022 exchange rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues during the period. in each of the tables below, we present the percent change based on actual, unrounded results in reported currency and in constant currency.

(1)comprised of europe, the middle east and africa excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, our total revenues increased across our three businesses during fiscal 2023 relative to fiscal 2022 primarily due to revenue contributions from our acquisition of cerner. excluding the impact of our acquisition of cerner, the constant currency revenues increase during fiscal 2023 relative to fiscal 2022 in our cloud and license business was attributable to growth in our cloud services and license support revenues as customers purchased our applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud and license deployment models and also renewed their related cloud contracts and license support contracts to continue to gain access to the latest versions of our technologies and to receive support services, partially offset by a decrease in our cloud license and on-premise license revenues. in our hardware business, the increase during fiscal 2023 was primarily due to growth in our oracle exadata and certain other strategic hardware product offerings. in our services business, the increase during fiscal 2023 was attributable to an increase in revenues for each of our primary services offerings.
in reported currency, cerner contributed $5.9 billion to our total revenues during fiscal 2023. in constant currency, the americas, the emea and the asia pacific regions contributed 84%, 10% and 6%, respectively, of the constant currency total revenue growth during fiscal 2023.
excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, our total operating expenses increased in fiscal 2023 relative to fiscal 2022 primarily due to additional operating expenses as a result of our acquisition of cerner, including higher intangible assets amortization; higher cloud services and license support expenses, which were primarily due to higher employee related expenses and infrastructure investments that were made to support the increase in our cloud and license business' revenues; higher hardware expenses, which were primarily due to incremental hardware product costs related to cerner's hardware business; higher restructuring expenses; and higher expenses across other operating expense categories primarily due to higher employee related expenses. furthermore, during fiscal 2022, we recorded gains of $250 million on operating asset sales, which was allocated as a benefit to most of our operating expense lines as presented per our consolidated statement of operations and which reduced our total operating expenses during the same period. these constant currency expense increases during fiscal 2023 were index to financial statements partially offset by the absence of $4.7 billion of litigation related charges that were recorded to acquisition related and other expenses during fiscal 2022. we do not expect the litigation related charges to recur in future periods.
in constant currency, our total operating margin and total operating margin as a percentage of revenues increased in fiscal 2023, relative to fiscal 2022, primarily due to certain litigation related charges noted above that increased our operating expenses during fiscal 2022.
supplemental disclosure related to certain charges to supplement our consolidated financial information, we believe that the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future.
our operating results reported pursuant to gaap included the following business combination accounting adjustments and expenses related to acquisitions and certain other expense and income items that affected our gaap net income:

total intangible assets, net        $9,837
(2)acquisition related and other expenses consist of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, certain business combination adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement period has ended and certain other operating items, net. for fiscal 2022, acquisition related and other expenses also included certain litigation related charges. we consider the litigation related charges that are included in this line item to be outside our ordinary course of business based on the following considerations: (i) the unprecedented nature of the litigation related charges including the nature and size of the damages awarded; (ii) the dissimilarity of this litigation and related charges to recurring litigation of which we are a party in our normal business course for which any and all such charges are included in our gaap operating results and are not separately quantified and disclosed within this line item or any other line in the table presented above; (iii) the complexity of the case; (iv) the counterparty involved; and (v) our expectation that litigation related charges of this nature will not recur in future periods; among other factors.
(3)restructuring expenses during fiscal 2023 and 2022 primarily related to employee severance in connection with our fiscal 2022 oracle restructuring plan (2022 restructuring plan). additional information regarding certain of our restructuring plans is provided in management's discussion below under "restructuring expenses," and in note 8 of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report.

(5)for fiscal 2023 and 2022, the applicable jurisdictional tax rates applied to our income before income taxes after excluding the tax effects of items within the table above such as for stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring, and certain acquisition related and other items, and after excluding the net deferred tax effects associated with a previously recorded income tax benefit that resulted from a partial index to financial statements realignment of our legal entity structure resulted in an effective tax rate of 16.3%, instead of 6.8%, for fiscal 2023 and 16.3%, instead of 12.2%, for fiscal 2022, which in each case represented our effective tax rates as derived per our consolidated statement of operations.
cloud and license business our cloud and license business engages in the sale and marketing of our applications and infrastructure technologies that are delivered through various deployment models and include: oracle license support offerings; oracle cloud services offerings; and oracle cloud license and on-premise license offerings. license support revenues are typically generated through the sale of applications and infrastructure license support contracts related to cloud licenses and on-premise licenses; are purchased by our customers at their option; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual term, which is generally one year. our cloud services deliver applications and infrastructure technologies on a subscription basis via cloud-based deployment models that we develop, provide unspecified updates and enhancements for, deploy, host, manage and support. revenues for our cloud services are generally recognized over the contractual term, which is generally one to three years, or in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed. cloud license and on-premise license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses, generally on a perpetual basis, to use our database and middleware and our applications software products within cloud and on-premise it environments and are generally recognized up front at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use. we continue to place significant emphasis, both domestically and internationally, on direct sales through our own sales force. we also continue to market certain of our offerings through indirect channels. costs associated with our cloud and license business are included in cloud services and license support expenses, and sales and marketing expenses. these costs are largely personnel and infrastructure related including the cost of providing our cloud services and license support offerings, salaries and commissions earned by our sales force for the sale of our cloud and license offerings, and marketing program costs.

index to financial statements excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and license business' total revenues increased in fiscal 2023 relative to fiscal 2022 due to growth in our cloud services and license support revenues as customers purchased our applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud and license deployment models and renewed their related cloud contracts and license support contracts to continue to gain access to the latest versions of our technologies and to receive support services for which we delivered such cloud and support services during the period presented, as well as revenue contributions from our cerner acquisition, partially offset by a decrease in our non-cerner cloud license and on-premise license revenues. in reported currency, cerner contributed $3.6 billion to our cloud and license business' revenues during fiscal 2023. in constant currency, the americas, the emea and the asia pacific regions contributed 84%, 9% and 7%, respectively, of the constant currency revenue growth for this business during fiscal 2023.
in constant currency, our total cloud and license business' expenses increased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to higher employee related expenses due to higher headcount; higher technology infrastructure expenses to support the increase in our cloud and license business' revenues; and additional operating expenses due to our cerner acquisition. in addition, an allocation of gains from operating asset sales in fiscal 2022 decreased our expenses during that period, with no comparable transaction in fiscal 2023. our cloud services and license support expenses have grown in recent periods, and we expect this growth to continue during fiscal 2024 as we increase our existing data center capacity and establish data centers in new geographic locations in order to meet current and expected customer demand.
excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and license business' total margin increased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 due to increases in total revenues for this business. total margin as a percentage of revenues for this business decreased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 due to expenses growth.
hardware business our hardware business' revenues are generated from the sales of our oracle engineered systems, server, storage, and industry-specific hardware offerings. the hardware product and related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. the revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product is delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer. our hardware business also earns revenues from the sale of hardware support contracts purchased by our customers at their option and that are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual term, which is generally one year. the majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels such as independent distributors and value-added resellers and we also market and sell our hardware products through our direct sales force. operating expenses associated with our hardware business include the cost of hardware products, which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by our internal manufacturing operations or by third-party manufacturers, warranty and related expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, including the impact of inventory determined to be excess and obsolete; the cost of materials used to repair customer products with eligible support contracts; the cost of labor and infrastructure to provide support services; and sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include variable compensation earned by our sales force for the sales of our hardware offerings.

the increase in our constant currency hardware revenues in fiscal 2023 was primarily due to revenue contributions from our cerner acquisition and growth in our oracle exadata and certain other strategic hardware product offerings, relative to fiscal 2022. in reported currency, cerner contributed $140 million to our hardware business' revenues in fiscal 2023. our hardware business' revenues were adversely impacted during fiscal 2023 and 2022 due to the impacts of the global supply chain shortages for technology components that resulted in certain manufacturing delays. in constant currency, the americas, the emea and the asia pacific regions contributed 75%, 16% and 9%, respectively, to the revenue growth for this business during fiscal 2023.
excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware expenses increased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to incremental hardware product costs from cerner's hardware business, partially offset by lower sales and marketing expenses due to lower headcount.
in constant currency, our hardware business' total margin increased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 due to higher total revenues for this business. in constant currency, total margin as a percentage of revenues remained flat in fiscal 2023 relative to fiscal 2022.

excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our total services revenues increased in fiscal 2023 relative to fiscal 2022 due to revenue contributions from our cerner acquisition and revenue increases in each of our primary services offerings. in reported currency, cerner contributed $2.2 billion to our services business' revenues during fiscal 2023. in constant currency, the americas, the emea and the asia pacific regions contributed 86%, 11% and 3%, respectively, to the revenue growth for this business during fiscal 2023.
in constant currency, total services expenses increased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to additional operating expenses due to our acquisition of cerner and other higher employee related expenses due to higher headcount.
in constant currency, our services business' total margin increased in fiscal 2023 relative to fiscal 2022 due to higher total revenues for this business. in constant currency, total margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2023 relative to fiscal 2022 due to expenses growth.
research and development expenses:  research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenditures. we intend to continue to invest significantly in our research and development efforts because, in our judgment, they are essential to maintaining our competitive position.

index to financial statements excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, acquisition related and other expenses decreased in fiscal 2023 relative to fiscal 2022 primarily due to the absence of $4.7 billion of litigation related charges recorded to acquisition related and other expenses during fiscal 2022 that we generally do not expect to recur, partially offset by higher transitional employee related costs related to our acquisition of cerner and certain facilities-related right-of-use assets that were abandoned in connection with plans to improve our cost structure and operations in fiscal 2023.
restructuring expenses: restructuring expenses resulted from the execution of management approved restructuring plans that were generally developed to improve our cost structure and/or operations, often in conjunction with our acquisition integration strategies and/or other strategic initiatives. restructuring expenses consist of employee severance costs, contract termination costs and certain other exit costs to improve our cost structure prospectively. for additional information regarding our restructuring plans, see note 8 of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report.

restructuring expenses in fiscal 2023 and 2022 primarily related to our 2022 restructuring plan. our management approved, committed to and initiated the 2022 restructuring plan in order to restructure and further improve efficiencies in our operations. we may incur additional restructuring expenses in future periods due to the initiation of new restructuring plans or from changes in estimated costs associated with existing restructuring plans.
the majority of the initiatives undertaken by our 2022 restructuring plan were effected to implement our continued emphasis in developing, marketing, selling and delivering our cloud-based offerings. certain of the cost savings realized pursuant to our 2022 restructuring plan initiatives were offset by investments in resources and geographies that better address the development, marketing, sale and delivery of our cloud-based offerings, including investments in the development and delivery of our second-generation cloud infrastructure.

interest expense increased in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to higher average borrowings during fiscal 2023 resulting from borrowings pursuant to a $15.7 billion delayed draw term loan credit agreement (bridge credit agreement), a $5.6 billion term loan credit agreement (term loan credit agreement), the issuance of $12.3 billion of senior notes and, to a lesser extent, issuances of commercial paper notes. the amount of indebtedness under the bridge credit agreement was fully repaid from the proceeds from borrowings under the term loan credit agreement and most of the proceeds from the issuance of $12.3 billion of senior notes during fiscal 2023. the increase in interest expense was partially offset by lower interest expense that resulted from $8.3 billion and $3.8 billion of scheduled repayments made during fiscal 2022 and 2023, respectively. refer to note 7 of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information.
non-operating expenses, net: non-operating expenses, net consists primarily of interest income, net foreign currency exchange losses, the noncontrolling interests in the net profits of our majority-owned subsidiaries (primarily oracle financial services software limited and oracle corporation japan), net losses related to equity investments including losses attributable to equity method investments and net other income and expenses, including net unrealized gains and losses from our investment portfolio related to our deferred compensation plan, and non-service net periodic pension income and losses.

our non-operating expenses, net decreased during fiscal 2023 relative to fiscal 2022 primarily due to higher interest income due to higher average interest rates that were applicable to our cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances; and lower other losses, net, which was primarily attributable to higher unrealized investment gain associated with certain marketable equity securities that we held for employee benefit plans, and for which an equal and offsetting amount was recorded to our operating expenses during the same period. these decreases were partially offset by higher net losses associated with equity investments and higher foreign currency losses.
provision for income taxes:   our effective income tax rates for each of the periods presented were the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates. refer to note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for a discussion regarding the differences between the effective income tax rates as presented for the periods below and the u.s. federal statutory income tax rates that were in effect during these periods. future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by an unfavorable shift of earnings weighted to jurisdictions with higher tax rates, by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations, by adverse rulings in tax related litigation, or by shortfalls in stock-based compensation realized by employees relative to stock-based compensation that was recorded for book purposes, among others.

provision for income taxes decreased during fiscal 2023, relative to the corresponding prior year period, primarily due to decreases attributable to a combination of the net excess benefit of amortization of cerner intangible assets, a favorable mix of earnings when compared to fiscal 2022, and, to a lesser extent, tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, which together were partially offset by the net tax impact of the absence of certain litigation related charges we incurred in fiscal 2022.

* not meaningful index to financial statements working capital: the decrease in working capital as of may 31, 2023 in comparison to may 31, 2022 was primarily due to $27.8 billion net cash used for our acquisition of cerner, $1.6 billion of repayment of senior notes assumed from our acquisition of cerner, $3.5 billion of long-term senior notes that were reclassified to current liabilities, cash used for repurchases of our common stock, cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders and cash used for capital expenditures during fiscal 2023. these unfavorable impacts were partially offset by cash proceeds from borrowings pursuant to the term loan credit agreement and the issuance of senior notes (refer to note 7 of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information), the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from net income and cash proceeds from stock option exercises. our working capital may be impacted by some or all of the aforementioned factors in future periods, the amounts and timing of which are variable.
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities:  cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, money market funds and other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. marketable securities consist of time deposits, marketable equity securities and certain other securities. the decrease in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at may 31, 2023 in comparison to may 31, 2022 was primarily due to the net cash outflows of $27.8 billion for our acquisition of cerner, $1.6 billion of repayment of senior notes assumed from our acquisition of cerner, $3.8 billion of repayment of senior notes due october 2022 and february 2023, repurchases of our common stock, payments of cash dividends to our stockholders and cash used for capital expenditures. these cash outflows during fiscal 2023 were partially offset by certain cash inflows, primarily due to cash inflows generated by borrowings pursuant to the term loan credit agreement and the issuance of senior notes and commercial paper notes, as well as cash inflows from our operations and stock option exercises during fiscal 2023. during fiscal 2023, we also borrowed $15.7 billion pursuant to the bridge credit agreement which was fully repaid within the same period.

* not meaningful cash flows from operating activities: our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers following the purchase and renewal of their license support agreements. payments from customers for these license support agreements are generally received near the beginning of the contracts' terms, which are generally one year in length. over the course of a fiscal year, we also have historically generated cash from the sales of new licenses, cloud services, hardware offerings and other services. our primary uses of cash from operating activities are typically for employee related expenditures, material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware products, taxes, interest payments and leased facilities.
net cash provided by operating activities increased during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to higher net income that was primarily due to the absence of certain litigation related charges recorded during fiscal 2022 that we generally do not expect to recur and certain cash favorable working capital changes, net in fiscal 2023 relative to fiscal 2022.
cash flows from investing activities: the changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to our acquisitions, the timing of our purchases, maturities and sales of our investments in marketable securities, and investments in capital and other assets, including certain intangible assets, to support our growth.
net cash used for investing activities was $36.5 billion during fiscal 2023 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $11.2 billion during fiscal 2022. the increase in net cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2023 was primarily due to the cash used for our acquisition of cerner, an increase in cash used for capital expenditures and a decrease in cash proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities and other investments, partially offset by a decrease in cash used for the purchases of marketable securities and other investments, in each case relative to fiscal 2022.
index to financial statements cash flows from financing activities: the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and repayments related to our debt instruments, stock repurchases, dividend payments and net proceeds related to employee stock programs.
net cash provided by financing activities was $7.9 billion during fiscal 2023 compared to the net cash used for financing activities of $29.1 billion in fiscal 2022. the increase in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the net cash proceeds from borrowings pursuant to the term loan credit agreement and the issuance of senior notes and commercial paper notes, net of repayments; lower stock repurchases; lower maturities of senior notes and higher net cash from our employee stock program, in each case during fiscal 2023 relative to fiscal 2022. during fiscal 2023, we also borrowed $15.7 billion pursuant to the bridge credit agreement which was fully repaid within the same period.
free cash flow: to supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a gaap basis, we use non-gaap measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis to analyze cash flows generated from our operations. we believe that free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors. the presentation of non-gaap free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. we calculate free cash flow as follows:

cash dividends: in fiscal 2023, we declared and paid cash dividends of $1.36 per share that totaled $3.7 billion. in june 2023, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share of our outstanding common stock payable on july 26, 2023 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on july 12, 2023. future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our board of directors.
credit agreements and related borrowings: on june 8, 2022, we borrowed $15.7 billion under the bridge credit agreement to partly finance our acquisition of cerner. we fully repaid the amount borrowed under the bridge credit agreement during fiscal 2023.
during fiscal 2023, we entered into and subsequently expanded the term loan credit agreement and borrowed a total of $4.7 billion under the first facility (term loan 1 facility) and $960 million under the second facility (term loan 2 facility and, together with the term loan 1 facility, the term loan facilities). we used the net proceeds of these borrowings to reduce the amount of indebtedness outstanding under the bridge credit agreement. we will begin making quarterly repayments of amounts borrowed under both term loan facilities in september 2024. any remaining unpaid principal balance under the term loan 1 facility will be fully due and payable on august 16, 2027, and any remaining unpaid principal balance under the term loan 2 facility will be fully due and payable on august 16, 2025, unless the termination date of one or both of the term loan facilities is extended.
senior notes: during fiscal 2023, we issued $12.3 billion of senior notes comprised of the following:
•$1.0 billion of 5.80% senior notes due november 2025;
•$750 million of 4.50% senior notes due may 2028;
•$1.25 billion of 6.15% senior notes due november 2029;
index to financial statements
•$750 million of 4.65% senior notes due may 2030;
•$2.25 billion of 6.25% senior notes due november 2032;
•$1.5 billion of 4.90% senior notes due february 2033;
•$2.5 billion of 6.90% senior notes due november 2052; and
•$2.25 billion of 5.55% senior notes due february 2053.
we used the net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes to repay the amount of indebtedness outstanding under the bridge credit agreement, to repay $1.3 billion of senior notes due february 2023 and to partially repay our outstanding commercial paper notes.
cerner senior notes and other borrowings: we assumed $1.6 billion of senior notes and other borrowings through our cerner acquisition, all of which were repaid during fiscal 2023.
commercial paper program: during fiscal 2023, our commercial paper program was increased to $6.0 billion. our commercial paper program allows us to issue and sell unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a private placement exemption from the registration requirements under federal and state securities laws. there were $563 million of outstanding commercial paper notes as of may 31, 2023 (none outstanding as of may 31, 2022) that mature at various dates through june 2023. we use the net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper for general corporate purposes.
additional details regarding these activities above are included in note 7 of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report.
common stock repurchase program: our board of directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. as of may 31, 2023, approximately $8.2 billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. we repurchased 17.0 million shares for $1.3 billion, 185.8 million shares for $16.2 billion, and 329.2 million shares for $21.0 billion in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economic and market conditions. our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases and pursuant to a rule 10b5-1 plan. our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.
contractual obligations: our largest contractual obligations as of may 31, 2023 consisted of:
•principal payments related to our senior notes and other borrowings that are included in our consolidated balance sheet and the related periodic interest payments;
•routine tax payments including those that are payable pursuant to the transition tax under the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 that are included in our consolidated balance sheet;
•operating lease liabilities that are included in our consolidated balance sheet; and
•other contractual commitments associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding.
in addition, as of may 31, 2023, we had $9.4 billion of gross unrecognized income tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, the nature of which is uncertain with respect to settlement or release with the relevant tax authorities, although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal 2024. we are involved in claims and legal proceedings, which are inherently uncertain with respect to outcomes, estimates and assumptions that we make as of each reporting period, are inherently unpredictable, and many aspects are out of our control. notes 2, 7, 13 and 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report include additional information regarding our most material contractual obligations and contingencies.
we believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances, cash generated from operations, and our $6.0 billion, five-year revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet our working capital, index to financial statements capital expenditures and contractual obligations requirements. in addition, we believe that we could fund our future acquisitions, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities.
stock-based awards our stock-based compensation program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders.
we recognize that stock-based awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of stock-based awards granted while providing competitive compensation packages. consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since june 1, 2020 has been an annualized rate of 1.8% per year. the potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of stock-based awards forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by the weighted-average outstanding shares during the calculation period. this maximum potential dilution will only result if all stock-based awards vest and, if applicable, are exercised. of the outstanding stock options at may 31, 2023, which generally have a ten-year exercise period, all have exercise prices lower than the market price of our common stock on such date. in recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock-based compensation program. however, we may modify the levels of our stock repurchases in the future depending on a number of factors, including the amount of cash we have available for acquisitions, to pay dividends, to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes. as of may 31, 2023, the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding stock-based awards, regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested, was 8.0%.
during fiscal 2023, the compensation committee of the board of directors reviewed and approved the annual organization-wide stock-based award grants to selected employees; all stock-based award grants to senior officers; and any individual grant of restricted stock units of 62,500 or greater. each member of a separate executive officer committee, referred to as the plan committee, was allocated a fiscal 2023 equity budget that could be used throughout the fiscal year to grant equity within his or her organization, subject to certain limitations established by the compensation committee.

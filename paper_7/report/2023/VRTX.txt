item 7.management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for 2023 as compared to 2022 are discussed below. for a discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for 2022 as compared to 2021, please refer to item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in our 2022 annual report on form 10-k, except as set forth below.
overview we are a global biotechnology company that invests in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for people with serious diseases, with a focus on specialty markets. we have four approved medicines that treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis ("cf"), a life-threatening genetic disease, and one approved therapy that treats severe sickle cell disease ("scd") and transfusion dependent beta thalassemia ("tdt"), life shortening inherited blood disorders. our pipeline includes clinical-stage programs in cf, sickle cell disease, beta thalassemia, acute and neuropathic pain, apol1-mediated kidney disease, type 1 diabetes, myotonic dystrophy type 1 and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.
our triple combination regimen, trikafta/kaftrio (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor), was approved in 2019 in the united states ("u.s.") and in 2020 in the european union ("e.u."). collectively, our four medicines are being used to treat nearly three quarters of the approximately 92,000 people with cf in north america, europe, and australia. we are evaluating our cf medicines in additional patient populations, including younger children, with the goal of having small molecule treatments for all people who have at least one mutation in their cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ("cftr") gene that is responsive to our cftr modulators. we also are pursuing messenger ribonucleic acid ("mrna") and genetic therapies for people with cf who do not make full-length cftr protein and, as a result, cannot benefit from our current cf medicines.
casgevy (exagamglogene autotemcel or "exa-cel"), an ex-vivo, non-viral crispr/cas9 gene-edited cell therapy, was recently approved in the u.s., the e.u., the united kingdom ("u.k."), the kingdom of saudi arabia ("saudi arabia"), and the kingdom of bahrain ("bahrain") for the treatment of people 12 years of age and older with scd and tdt. we estimate approximately 35,000 people with severe scd or tdt could be eligible for casgevy in the u.s. and europe, with additional people in saudi arabia and bahrain. in addition, we are preparing for near-term launches of potential new products in cf and acute pain.
financial highlights revenues       in 2023, our net product revenues increased to $9.9 billion as compared to $8.9 billion in 2022. the increase was primarily due to the continued strong uptake of trikafta/kaftrio in ex-u.s. markets and label extensions in younger age groups, and the continued performance of trikafta in the u.s., following the launch of trikafta in children with cf 2 to 5 years of age.
expenses       our total research and development ("r&amp;d"), acquired in-process research and development ("aipr&amp;d"), and selling, general and administrative ("sg&amp;a") expenses increased to $4.8 billion in 2023 as compared to $3.6 billion in 2022. the increase was primarily due to increased aipr&amp;d, the progression of several product candidates in mid- to late-stage clinical development and costs to support global launches. cost of sales was 13% and 12% of our net product revenues in 2023 and 2022, respectively.
cash           our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased to $13.7 billion as of december 31, 2023 as compared to $10.9 billion as of december 31, 2022 primarily due to our income from operations driven by our net product revenues, and interest income, partially offset by our income tax payments and repurchases of our common stock.
note: charts above may not add due to rounding.
business updates marketed products cystic fibrosis we expect to grow our cf business with (i) continued uptake by patients in countries where we are early in our launch, such as those with recently achieved reimbursement agreements, (ii) label expansions, including into younger patient groups, and (iii) growth in the number of people living with cf. recent progress in activities supporting continued uptake and label expansions is included below:
•the u.s. food and drug administration ("fda"), the european commission, the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency ("mhra"), and health canada approved trikafta/kaftrio for the treatment of children with cf 2 to 5 years of age who have at least one f508del mutation in the cftr gene.
•the european medicines agency ("ema") validated the marketing authorization application ("maa") extension for kaftrio in combination with ivacaftor to include people with cf who have a rare mutation in the cftr gene that is responsive based on clinical and/or in vitro data, including the n1303k mutation. we plan to submit regulatory filings for these mutations in australia, brazil, canada, new zealand and switzerland, and we plan to submit for regulatory approval of a subset of these mutations not currently included in the u.s. trikafta label to the fda.
•the fda and the european commission approved the use of orkambi for children with cf 12 to less than 24 months of age who are homozygous for the f508del mutation in the cftr gene.
•the fda and mhra approved kalydeco in children with cf from 1 month to less than 4 months of age.
sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia
•casgevy is now approved in the u.s., the e.u., the u.k., saudi arabia, and bahrain for people 12 years of age and older with scd or tdt.
•the french national authority for health ("has") approved our request for the implementation of an early access program ("eap") for the use of casgevy to treat eligible people with tdt from 12 to 35 years of age. we are also pursuing an eap submission for scd in france and we expect to receive the outcome of this decision in the coming months.
•our regulatory submission for casgevy in both scd and tdt is currently under review in switzerland. we expect to submit for regulatory approval of casgevy in canada in the first half of 2024.
•we have activated 12 authorized treatment centers ("atcs") in the u.s. and three atcs in europe. we are aiming to activate approximately 50 atcs in the u.s. and 25 in europe. we also have activated one of two planned atcs in saudi arabia.
•we entered into an agreement with synergie medication collective, a medication contracting organization, which covers approximately 100 million people, to provide access to casgevy.
potential near-term launch opportunities we are preparing for the following near-term launches of potential new products:
vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor in cf
•we completed the pivotal skyline 102 and skyline 103 clinical trials, which evaluate the efficacy and safety of our new once-daily investigational triple combination vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor relative to trikafta in people with cf 12 years of age and older, and the ridgeline clinical trial of vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor in children with cf 6 to 11 years of age, at the end of 2023.
•in february 2024, we announced positive data from this phase 3 program evaluating the new triple combination regimen. we expect to submit global regulatory filings by mid-2024, including a new drug application ("nda") to the fda, using a priority review voucher, and maas to the ema and health canada.
vx-548 in acute pain
•we completed the pivotal program evaluating our lead compound, vx-548, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain, which included one randomized controlled phase 3 pivotal trial in abdominoplasty, one randomized, controlled phase 3 clinical trial in bunionectomy, and one single-arm safety and effectiveness clinical trial. in january 2024, we announced positive results from these clinical trials and we announced our plans to submit an nda to the fda for vx-548 in moderate-to-severe acute pain by mid-2024.
•in the u.s., vx-548 has been granted breakthrough therapy and fast track designations for moderate-to-severe acute pain.
pipeline we continue to advance a diversified pipeline of potentially transformative medicines for serious diseases utilizing a range of modalities. recent and anticipated progress in activities supporting these efforts is included below:
cystic fibrosis
•in collaboration with moderna, we are developing vx-522, a cftr mrna therapeutic for the treatment of people with cf who do not produce full-length cftr protein. we completed dosing in the single ascending dose part of the clinical trial for vx-522 and initiated the multiple ascending dose part of the clinical trial in late 2023. we expect to share data from this clinical trial in late 2024 or early 2025. in the u.s., the fda has granted fast track designation for vx-522.
•we are investigating a portfolio of other small molecules targeting the underlying cause of cf with the aim of achieving carrier levels of cftr function. we also are investigating additional potential treatments for people with cf who do not make full-length cftr protein and cannot benefit from cftr modulators.
sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia
•we have completed enrollment in two global phase 3 clinical trials evaluating casgevy in children 5 to 11 years of age with scd or tdt.
•we continue to work on preclinical assets for myeloablative conditioning agents that would have milder side-effects and could be used in connection with casgevy, which could broaden the eligible patient population.
peripheral neuropathic pain
•we have completed the phase 2 dose-ranging clinical trial evaluating vx-548 in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, a common form of chronic peripheral neuropathic pain, and announced positive results from this clinical trial. we plan to meet with regulators in the first quarter of 2024 and then we expect to advance vx-548 for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy into pivotal development.
•we initiated a second phase 2 clinical trial evaluating vx-548 in patients with peripheral neuropathic pain in december 2023. this clinical trial will evaluate vx-548 in patients with lumbosacral radiculopathy, a second type of peripheral neuropathic pain. screening, enrollment and dosing are underway in this clinical trial.
•we expect to initiate a phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the oral formulation of vx-993, a next generation nav1.8 inhibitor, for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain in 2024.
acute pain
•we have completed a phase 1 clinical trial evaluating an oral formulation of vx-993, a next generation nav1.8 inhibitor. we expect to initiate a phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the oral formulation of vx-993 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain in the second half of 2024.
•we anticipate completing ind-enabling studies and filing an investigational new drug application ("ind") for an intravenous formulation of vx-993 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain in 2024.
•we are advancing multiple nav1.7 inhibitors, including in combination with nav1.8 inhibitors, through research and earlier stages of development for both acute and peripheral neuropathic pain.
apol1-mediated kidney disease
•inaxaplin is our small molecule for the treatment of apol1-mediated kidney disease ("amkd"), including apol1-mediated focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ("fsgs"). we completed enrollment in the phase 2b dose-ranging portion of the pivotal program for inaxaplin, a single phase 2/3 clinical trial in patients with amkd. we expect to select a dose and begin the phase 3 portion of the clinical trial in the first quarter of 2024.
•the fda granted breakthrough therapy designation to inaxaplin for apol1-mediated fsgs and the ema granted orphan drug and prime designations to inaxaplin for amkd.
type 1 diabetes
•vx-880 is an allogeneic stem cell-derived, fully differentiated, insulin-producing islet cell replacement therapy, using standard immunosuppression to protect the implanted cells. we are evaluating vx-880 as a potential treatment for type 1 diabetes ("t1d") in a sequential, three-part phase 1/2 clinical trial. we have completed enrollment in part c of the clinical trial. we have placed the clinical trial on a protocol-specified pause, pending review of the totality of the data by an independent data monitoring committee and global regulators, following two patient deaths, both unrelated to vx-880.
•our second phase 1/2 program in t1d evaluates vx-264, which encapsulates the same vx-880 cells in a novel device designed to eliminate the need for immunosuppression. this trial is a sequential, multi-part study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of vx-264. we have completed part a of the clinical trial and part b has been initiated in multiple centers and countries.
•our hypoimmune islet cell program uses crispr/cas9 technology to gene-edit the same allogeneic stem cell-derived, fully differentiated islets used in the vx-880 and vx-264 programs. the goal is to cloak the cells from the immune system to explore another possible path to eliminate the need for immunosuppressive therapy. this program continues to progress through the research stage.
myotonic dystrophy type 1
•we have established a collaboration with entrada therapeutics, inc. ("entrada") to address the functional impact of the causal mutation in the gene that causes myotonic dystrophy type 1 ("dm1"), which includes vx-670. vx-670 is designed to enable efficient intracellular delivery of an oligonucleotide, which we believe will address the underlying pathophysiology and restore normal cell function.
•we initiated a phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating vx-670 in patients with dm1. the clinical trial is active and enrolling in canada and will initiate in the u.k. in the near term.
alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency
•we are working to address the underlying genetic cause of alpha-1 antitrypsin ("aat") deficiency ("aatd"). we are developing novel small molecule correctors of z-aat protein folding, with the goal of enabling the secretion of functional aat into the blood and addressing both the lung and the liver aspects of aatd. we continue to enroll and dose healthy volunteers in phase 1 clinical trials evaluating vx-634 and vx-668, our next-wave investigational molecule aat correctors with significantly improved potency and drug-like properties as compared to the first-generation aatd correctors.
our business environment in 2023, our net product revenues came from the sale of our medicines for the treatment of cf. our cf strategy involves continuing to develop and obtain approval and reimbursement for treatment regimens that will provide benefits to all people with cf and increasing the number of people with cf eligible and able to receive our medicines, including through label expansions, expanded reimbursement, and the development of new medicines. we are advancing our pipeline of product candidates for the treatment of serious diseases outside of cf, including casgevy, which recently received marketing approvals in the u.s., the e.u., the u.k., saudi arabia, and bahrain for the treatment of scd and tdt. we anticipate broad access with government and commercial payors for casgevy in the u.s., and we anticipate early access programs initially, such as the recently approved early access program for tdt in france, and are pursuing long-term reimbursement agreements outside of the u.s.
our strategy is to combine transformative advances in the understanding of causal human biology and the science of therapeutics to discover and develop innovative medicines. this approach includes advancing multiple compounds or therapies from each program, spanning multiple modalities, into early clinical trials to obtain patient data that can inform selection of the most promising therapies for later-stage development, as well as to inform discovery and development efforts. we aim to rapidly follow our first-in-class therapies that achieve proof-of-concept with potential best-in-class candidates to provide durable clinical and commercial success.
in pursuit of new product candidates and therapies in specialty markets, we invest in research and development. we believe that pursuing research in diverse areas allows us to balance the risks inherent in product development and may provide product candidates that will form our pipeline in future years. to supplement our internal research programs, we acquire technologies and programs and collaborate with biopharmaceutical and technology companies, leading academic research institutions, government laboratories, foundations and other organizations, as needed, to advance research in our areas of therapeutic interest and to access technologies needed to execute on our strategy.
discovery and development of a new pharmaceutical or biological product is a difficult and lengthy process that requires significant financial resources along with extensive technical and regulatory expertise. across the industry, most potential drug or biological products never progress into development, and most products that do advance into development never receive marketing approval. our investments in product candidates are subject to considerable risks. we closely monitor the results of our discovery, research, clinical trials and nonclinical studies and frequently evaluate our product development programs in light of new data and scientific, business and commercial insights, with the objective of balancing risk and potential. this process can result in rapid changes in focus and priorities as new information becomes available and as we gain additional understanding of our ongoing programs and potential new programs, as well as those of our competitors.
our business also requires ensuring appropriate manufacturing and reimbursement of our products. as we advance our product candidates through clinical development toward commercialization and market and sell our approved products, we build and maintain our supply chain and quality assurance resources. we rely on a global network of third parties and our internal capabilities to manufacture and distribute our products for commercial sale and post-approval clinical trials and to manufacture and distribute our product candidates for clinical trials. in addition to establishing supply chains for each new approved product, we adapt our supply chain for existing products to include additional formulations or to increase scale of production for existing products as needed. the processes for cell and genetic therapies can be more complex than those required for small molecule drugs and require additional investments in different systems, equipment, facilities and expertise. we are focused on ensuring the stability of the supply chains for our current products, as well as for our pipeline programs.
sales of our products depend, to a large degree, on the extent to which our products are reimbursed by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed health care organizations. reimbursement for our products, including our potential pipeline therapies, cannot be assured and may take significant periods of time to obtain. we dedicate substantial management and other resources to obtain and maintain appropriate levels of reimbursement for our products from third-party payors, including governmental organizations in the u.s. and ex-u.s. markets.
in the u.s., we have worked successfully with third-party payors to promptly obtain appropriate levels of reimbursement for our cf medicines and are currently working with u.s. government and commercial payors with respect to casgevy. we plan to continue to engage in discussions with numerous commercial insurers and managed health care organizations, along with government health programs that are typically managed by authorities in the individual states, to ensure that payors recognize the significant benefits that our therapies provide and provide patients with appropriate levels of access to our medicines and therapies now and in the future. we cannot, however, predict how recent changes in the law, including through the inflation reduction act of 2022 and passage of state laws (e.g., transparency laws and prescription drug affordability boards), will affect our ability to negotiate successfully with third-party payors and distribute our products. similarly, in ex-u.s. markets, we seek government reimbursement for our medicines on a country-by-country or region-by-region basis, as required. this is necessary for each new medicine, as well as for label expansions for our current medicines. we are beginning to work with ex-u.s. payors with respect to casgevy. we expect to continue to focus significant resources to expand and maintain reimbursement for our cf medicines, casgevy and, ultimately, pipeline therapies, in u.s. and ex-u.s. markets.
strategic transactions acquisitions as part of our business strategy, we seek to acquire technologies, products, product candidates and other businesses that are aligned with our corporate and research and development strategies and complement and advance our ongoing research and development efforts. we have engaged in a number of acquisitions of privately held biotechnology companies over the last several years. in 2019, we acquired semma therapeutics, inc., pursuant to which we established our t1d program, and exonics therapeutics, inc., which enhanced our gene-editing capabilities to repair mutations that cause severe neuromuscular diseases, such as dm1 and duchenne muscular dystrophy. in 2022, we acquired viacyte, inc. ("viacyte"), which had intellectual property, tools, technologies and assets with the potential to accelerate development of our t1d programs. our acquisition of viacyte, for $315.0 million, was accounted for as a business combination. as of the acquisition date, the cash payment was allocated primarily to goodwill and the fair value of an in-process research and development asset.
in 2023 and 2022, we also acquired programs that were accounted for as asset acquisitions resulting in $47.5 million and $60.0 million of aipr&d, respectively.
please refer to our critical accounting policies, "acquisitions," for further information regarding the significant judgments and estimates related to our acquisitions.
collaboration and in-licensing arrangements we enter into arrangements with third parties, including collaboration and licensing arrangements, for the development, manufacture and commercialization of products, product candidates, and other technologies that have the potential to complement our ongoing research and development efforts.
over the last several years, we entered into collaboration agreements with a number of companies, including crispr, entrada, and moderna, inc. generally, when we in-license a technology or product candidate, we make upfront payments to the collaborator, assume the costs of the program and/or agree to make contingent payments, which could consist of milestone, royalty and option payments. most of these collaboration payments are expensed as aipr&d, including, in 2023, our total payments of $242.6 million to entrada and our total upfront and milestone payments of $170.0 million to crispr related to t1d, because they are primarily attributable to acquired in-process research and development for which there is no alternative future use. however, depending on many factors, including the structure of the collaboration, the stage of development of the acquired technology, the significance of the in-licensed product candidate to the collaborator's operations and the other activities in which our collaborators are engaged, the accounting for these transactions can vary significantly. we expect to continue to identify and evaluate collaboration and licensing opportunities that may be similar to or different from the collaborations and licenses that we have engaged in previously.
joint development and commercialization agreement with crispr in 2017, we entered into a joint development and commercialization agreement (the "original jdca") with crispr, pursuant to which we are developing and commercializing casgevy for scd and tdt. the original jdca was entered into following our exercise of an option to co-develop and co-commercialize the hemoglobinopathies program that was contained in a collaboration agreement that we entered into with crispr in 2015.
in april 2021, we and crispr entered into an amendment and restatement of the original jdca (the "a&r jdca"). in june 2021, we made a $900.0 million upfront payment to crispr in connection with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the a&r jdca. we concluded that we did not have any alternative future use for the acquired in-process research and development and recorded this upfront payment to aipr&d. under the terms of the a&r jdca, we lead worldwide development, manufacturing, and commercialization of casgevy. as of july 1, 2021, 60% of the net profits and net losses for casgevy are allocated to us and 40% of the net profits and net losses for casgevy are allocated to crispr, subject to certain adjustments. we concluded that the original jdca and the a&r jdca are cost-sharing arrangements, which result in the net impact of the arrangements, excluding amounts recorded to aipr&d, being recorded in "research and development expenses" or "selling, general and administrative expenses." in our consolidated statements of income.
casgevy was approved by the fda in december 2023 for the treatment of scd. upon this approval, we made a $200.0 million milestone payment to crispr, which we recorded within "other intangible assets, net" on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2023. we also recorded an immaterial amount of intangible asset amortization expense to "cost of sales" in the fourth quarter of 2023 related to this intangible asset. subsequent to receiving marketing approval for casgevy, we continue to lead the research and development activities under the a&r jdca, subject to crispr's reserved right to conduct certain activities. we are reimbursed by crispr for its 40% share of these research and development activities, subject to certain adjustments, and we continue to record this reimbursement from crispr within "research and development expenses." we also share with crispr 40% of the net commercial profits or losses incurred with respect to casgevy, subject to certain adjustments. in 2023, the net commercial loss incurred with respect to casgevy was not material to our consolidated statement of income.
acquired in-process research and development expenses in 2023 and 2022, our aipr&d included $527.1 million and $115.5 million, respectively, related to upfront, contingent milestone, or other payments pursuant to our business development transactions, including the collaborations, licenses of third-party technologies, and asset acquisitions described above. please refer to note b, "collaboration, license and other arrangements," for further information regarding our collaboration, in-license agreements and asset acquisitions.

** not meaningful product revenues, net in 2023, our net product revenues increased by $938.5 million, or 11%, as compared to 2022. the increase was primarily due to the continued strong uptake of trikafta/kaftrio in ex-u.s. markets and label extensions in younger age groups, and the continued performance of trikafta in the u.s., following the launch of trikafta in children with cf 2 to 5 years of age. decreases in revenues for our products other than trikafta/kaftrio were primarily the result of patients switching from these medicines to trikafta/kaftrio.
our net product revenues from the u.s. and from ex-u.s. markets were as follows:

** not meaningful beginning in 2022, we separately classify upfront, contingent milestone, or other payments pursuant to our business development transactions, including collaborations, licenses of third-party technologies, and asset acquisitions as "acquired in-process research and development expenses," in our consolidated statements of income in cases where such acquired assets do not have an alternative future use. to conform prior periods to our current presentation, we have reclassified $1.1 billion from "research and development expenses" to aipr&d for 2021.
cost of sales our cost of sales primarily consists of third-party royalties payable on net sales of our products as well as the cost of producing inventories. pursuant to our agreement with the cystic fibrosis foundation, our tiered third-party royalties on sales of trikafta/kaftrio, symdeko/symkevi, kalydeco, and orkambi, calculated as a percentage of net sales, range from the single digits to the sub-teens, with lower royalties on sales of trikafta/kaftrio than for our other products. over the last several years, our cost of sales has been increasing due to increased net product revenues. our cost of sales as a percentage of our net product revenues was 13% and 12% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. in 2024, we expect our total cost of sales, including as a percentage of our net product revenues, will increase due to expected increases in our cf net product revenues and costs associated with casgevy.

our research and development expenses include internal and external costs incurred for research and development of our products and product candidates. we do not assign our internal costs, such as salary and benefits, stock-based compensation expense, laboratory supplies and other direct expenses and infrastructure costs, to individual products or product candidates, because the employees within our research and development groups typically are deployed across multiple research and development programs. we assign external costs of services provided to us by clinical research organizations and other outsourced research by individual program. our internal costs are greater than our external costs. all research and development costs for our products and product candidates are expensed as incurred.
over the past three years, we have incurred $9.4 billion in total research and development and aipr&d expenses associated with product discovery and development. the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risks. in addition, the duration of clinical trials may vary substantially according to the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate and the disease indication being targeted. the fda and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial requirements on the introduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products, typically requiring lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures, sampling activities and other costly and time-consuming procedures. data obtained from nonclinical and clinical activities at any step in the testing process may be adverse and lead to discontinuation or redirection of development activities. data obtained from these activities also are susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. the duration and cost of discovery, nonclinical studies and clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project and are difficult to predict. therefore, accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate costs to bring our product candidates to market are not available.
any estimates regarding development and regulatory timelines for our product candidates are highly subjective and subject to change. until we have data from phase 3 clinical trials, we cannot make a meaningful estimate regarding when, or if, a clinical development program will generate revenues and cash flows.

aipr&d in 2023 was primarily related to our $225.1 million upfront payment to entrada, $100.0 million upfront payment and $70.0 million t1d research milestone to crispr, $47.5 million acquisition of a novel gpcr program from septerna, and various other payments. aipr&d in 2022 was primarily related to the $60.0 million payment to acquire catalyst's complement portfolio, a $25.0 million upfront payment pursuant to our license agreement with verve, and various other payments. our aipr&d has historically fluctuated, and is expected to continue to fluctuate, from one period to another due to upfront, contingent milestone, and other payments pursuant to our existing and future business development transactions, including collaborations, licenses of third-party technologies, and asset acquisitions.
aipr&d in 2021 primarily related to the $900.0 million upfront payment we made to crispr in connection with the a&r jdca.

selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 20% in 2023 as compared to 2022, primarily due to the continued investment to support the commercialization of our medicines, including increased commercial headcount, outsourced services to support our pipeline product candidates and stock-based compensation expense. we expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in 2024 as we progress our efforts in preparation for the potential commercialization of vx-548 and launch casgevy.
contingent consideration in 2023, the fair value of our contingent consideration decreased by $51.6 million primarily due to our determination that additional pre-clinical studies of the delivery system for our gene-editing components for duchenne muscular dystrophy ("dmd") will be required. in 2022, the fair value of our contingent consideration decreased by $57.5 million, primarily as a result of a revision to the scope of certain gene-editing programs in the second quarter of 2022. in future periods, we expect the fair value of contingent consideration to increase or decrease based on, among other things, our estimates of the probability of achieving and the timing of these contingent development and regulatory milestone payments, as well as the time value of money and changes in market interest rates.
other non-operating income (expense), net interest income interest income increased to $614.7 million in 2023, as compared to $144.6 million in 2022, primarily due to increased market interest rates and increased cash equivalents and available-for-sale debt securities. our future interest income is dependent on the amount of, and prevailing market interest rates on, our outstanding cash equivalents and available-for-sale debt securities.
interest expense interest expense was $44.1 million in 2023, as compared to $54.8 million in 2022. the majority of our interest expense in these periods was related to imputed interest expense associated with our leased corporate headquarters in boston.
other income (expense), net other income (expense), net was expenses of $22.8 million and $164.8 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. these amounts related primarily to net unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value or sales of certain of our strategic equity investments, which consist of investments in our collaborators that may be public or private companies. to the extent that we continue to hold strategic equity investments in publicly traded companies, we expect that due to the volatility of the stock price of biotechnology companies, our other income (expense), net will fluctuate in future periods based on increases or decreases in the fair value of our strategic equity investments. as of december 31, 2023, these investments had a fair value of $46.0 million. we discuss these potential future fluctuations further in item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.
income taxes our effective tax rate fluctuates from year to year due to the global nature of our operations. the factors that most significantly impact our effective tax rate include changes in tax laws, variability in the allocation of our taxable earnings among multiple jurisdictions, the amount and characterization of our research and development expenses, the levels of certain deductions and credits, adjustments to the value of our uncertain tax positions, acquisitions and third-party collaboration and licensing transactions.
our provision for income taxes was $760.2 million for 2023 and $910.4 million for 2022. our effective tax rate of 17.4% for 2023 was lower than the u.s. statutory rate primarily due to a benefit from a research and development tax credit study that was completed in 2023 and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, partially offset by changes in uncertain tax positions.
our effective tax rate of 21.5% for 2022 was higher than the u.s. statutory rate primarily due to an increase in our uncertain tax positions associated with intercompany transfer pricing matters partially offset by excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, tax credits, and changes in our estimated prior-year tax liabilities.

working capital our total working capital of $10.6 billion as of december 31, 2023 was similar to our total working capital of $10.5 billion as of december 31, 2022 primarily due to $3.8 billion of income from operations mostly offset by net purchases of long-term marketable securities of $2.4 billion, income tax payments and repurchases of our common stock of $427.6 million.

operating activities cash provided by operating activities was $3.5 billion in 2023 as compared to $4.1 billion in 2022. the largest driver of the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2023 as compared to 2022 was an increase in cash paid for income taxes.
investing activities cash used in investing activities was $3.1 billion and $321.1 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. in 2023, our investing activities primarily related to net purchases of available-for-sale debt securities of $2.9 billion. in 2022, our investing activities included a net payment of $295.9 million to acquire viacyte and $204.7 million in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by net sales and maturities of available-for-sale debt securities of $227.3 million.
financing activities cash used in financing activities was $562.2 million and $67.7 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. in 2023, our financing activities primarily related to repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program and payments related to our employee stock benefit plans. in 2022, the largest portions of our financing activities were payments related to our employee stock benefit plans and payments on finance leases.
sources and uses of liquidity as of december 31, 2023, we had current cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $11.2 billion, which represented an increase of $439.8 million from $10.8 billion as of december 31, 2022. we intend to rely on our existing cash, cash equivalents and current marketable securities together with cash flows from product sales as our primary source of liquidity.
we expect that cash flows from our product sales together with our cash, cash equivalents and current marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. the adequacy of our available funds to meet our future operating and capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our future product sales, and the potential introduction of one or more of our other product candidates to the market, our business development activities and the number, breadth, cost and prospects of our research and development programs.
credit facilities & financing strategy we may borrow up to a total of $500.0 million pursuant to a revolving credit facility that we entered into in july 2022 and could repay and reborrow amounts under this revolving credit agreement without penalty. subject to certain conditions, we could request that the borrowing capacity be increased by an additional $500.0 million, for a total of $1.0 billion. negative covenants in our credit agreement could prohibit or limit our ability to access this source of liquidity. as of december 31, 2023, the facility was undrawn, and we were in compliance with these covenants.
we may also raise additional capital by borrowing under credit agreements, through public offerings or private placements of our securities, or securing new collaborative agreements or other methods of financing. we will continue to manage our capital structure and will consider all financing opportunities, whenever they may occur, that could strengthen our long-term liquidity profile. there can be no assurance that any such financing opportunities will be available on acceptable terms, if at all.
future capital requirements we have significant future capital requirements, including:
•expected operating expenses to conduct research and development activities, manufacture and commercialize our existing and future products, and to operate our organization.
•cash that we pay for income taxes.
•royalties we pay related to sales of our cf products.
•facility, operating and finance lease obligations as described below.
•firm purchase obligations related to our supply and manufacturing processes.
in addition, other potential significant future capital requirements may include:
•we have entered into certain business development-related and strategic agreements with third parties that include the funding of certain research, development, manufacturing and commercialization efforts. certain of our transactions, including collaborations, licensing arrangements, and asset acquisitions, include the potential for future milestone and royalty payments by us upon the achievement of pre-established developmental and regulatory targets and/or commercial targets. other transactions include the potential for future lease-related expenses and other costs. our obligation to fund these research and development and commercialization efforts and to pay these potential milestones, expenses and royalties is contingent upon continued involvement in the programs and/or the lack of any adverse events that could cause their discontinuance. we may enter into additional business development transactions and strategic agreements, including acquisitions, collaborations, licensing arrangements and equity investments, which require additional capital.
•to the extent we borrow amounts under our existing credit agreement, we would be required to repay any outstanding principal amounts in 2027.
•as of december 31, 2023, we had $2.6 billion remaining authorization available under our $3.0 billion share repurchase program that our board of directors approved in february 2023. we expect to fund repurchases of our common stock through a combination of cash on hand and cash generated by operations. this program does not have an expiration date and can be discontinued at any time.
additional information on several of our future capital requirements is provided below.
research and development costs at any point in time, we have several ongoing clinical trials at various stages of clinical development. our clinical trial costs are dependent on, among other things, our research activities advancing to later-stage clinical development as well as the size, number, and length of our clinical trials.
leases finance leases our corporate headquarters is in two buildings that we lease at fan pier in boston, massachusetts. we commenced lease payments on these buildings in 2013 and the initial lease periods end in december 2028. we also lease office and laboratory space in san diego, california. we commenced lease payments for this building in 2019 pursuant to an initial 16-year lease term. we account for each of these buildings as finance leases.
operating leases we account for our remaining real estate leases as operating leases, including office and laboratory space at the jeffrey leiden center for cell and genetic therapies near our corporate headquarters. base rent payments commenced in 2021 pursuant to an initial 15-year lease term for this building.
our total future minimum lease payments for our finance and operating leases for each of the next five years and in total are included in note l, "leases." the total future undiscounted minimum lease payments were $583.0 million and $436.1 million related to our finance and operating leases, respectively, as of december 31, 2023.
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the u.s. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. these items are monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which the change occurs. we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate.
we believe that our application of the following accounting policies, each of which requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management, are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results:
•revenue recognition;
•acquisitions, including intangible assets, goodwill and contingent consideration; and
•income taxes.
our accounting policies, including the ones discussed below, are more fully described in note a, "nature of business and accounting policies."
revenue recognition cf product revenues, net we generate cf product revenues from sales in the u.s. and in international markets. we sell our cf products principally to a limited number of specialty pharmacy and specialty distributors in the u.s., which account for the largest portion of our total revenues. our customers in the u.s. subsequently resell our products to patients and health care providers. we contract with government agencies so that our products will be eligible for purchase by, or partial or full reimbursement from, such third-party payors. we make international sales primarily through distributor arrangements and to retail pharmacies, as well as to hospitals and clinics, many of which are government-owned or supported customers. we recognize net cf product revenues from sales of our products when our customers obtain control of our products, which typically occurs upon delivery to our customers. revenues from our cf product sales are recorded at the net sales price, or transaction price, which requires us to make several significant estimates regarding the net sales price.
the most significant estimate we are required to make for our cf product revenues is related to government and private payor rebates, chargebacks, discounts and fees, collectively rebates. the values of the rebates provided to third-party payors per course of treatment vary significantly and are based on government-mandated discounts and our arrangements with other third-party payors. to estimate our total rebates, we estimate the percentage of prescriptions that will be covered by each third-party payor, which is referred to as the payor mix. we track available information regarding changes, if any, to the payor mix for our products, to our contractual terms with third-party payors and to applicable governmental programs and regulations and levels of our products in the distribution channel. we adjust our estimated rebates based upon new information as it becomes available, including information regarding actual rebates for our products. claims by third-party payors for rebates are submitted to us significantly after the related sales, potentially resulting in adjustments in the period in which the new information becomes known.
the following table summarizes activity related to our cf product revenue accruals for rebates for 2023, 2022 and 2021:

balance as of december 31, 2023                       $1,701.6
we have also entered into annual contracts with government-owned and supported customers in international markets that limit the amount of annual reimbursement we can receive for our cf products. upon exceeding the annual reimbursement amount provided by the customer's contract with us, products are provided free of charge, which is a material right. if we estimate that the annual reimbursement amount under a contract will be exceeded for an annual period, we defer a portion of the consideration received, which includes upfront payments and fees, for shipments made up to the annual reimbursement limit as "other current liabilities." once the annual reimbursement limit has been reached, we recognize the deferred amount as revenue when we ship the free products. to estimate the portion of the consideration received to be recognized as revenue and the portion of the amount to be deferred, we rely on our forecast of the number of units we will distribute during the applicable annual period in each international market in which our contracts with government-owned and supported customers limit the amount of annual reimbursement we can receive. our forecasts are based on, among other things, our historical experience.
the preceding estimates and judgments materially affect our recognition of net cf product revenues. changes in our estimates of net cf product revenues could have a material effect on net cf product revenues recorded in the period in which we determine that change occurs.
acquisitions as part of our business strategy, we seek to acquire products, product candidates and other technologies and businesses that are aligned with our corporate and research and development strategies and complement and advance our ongoing research and development efforts. if we determine that substantially all the fair value associated with an acquisition is concentrated in a single asset, and the acquisition does not constitute a business, we account for it as an asset acquisition. for an asset acquisition involving rights to intellectual property related to in-process research and development that is not yet associated with a product that has achieved regulatory approval, we generally record our upfront payment to aipr&d, because there is no alternative future use for the asset that was acquired. for example, we accounted for our a&r jdca with crispr in 2021 as an asset acquisition of rights to in-process research and development for which we did not have any alternative future use and recorded the associated $900.0 million upfront payment to aipr&d.
if the fair value that we acquired in an acquisition is distributed among more than one asset, and the acquisition constitutes a business, we account for it as a business combination.
we are required to make several significant judgments and estimates to calculate the purchase price for our business combinations and then allocate it to the assets that we have acquired and the liabilities that we have assumed on our consolidated balance sheet. the most significant judgments and estimates relate to the fair value of the in-process research and development assets and contingent consideration liabilities related to these business combinations. based on these judgments and estimates, the fair value of the goodwill that we record as a result of these business combinations may be material.
in-process research and development intangible assets as of each of december 31, 2023 and 2022, we had $603.6 million of in-process research and development assets on our consolidated balance sheet within "other intangible assets, net." most recently, we recorded a $216.6 million in-process research and development intangible asset related to our acquisition of viacyte on our consolidated balance sheet in 2022. we characterize in-process research and development assets on our consolidated balance sheets as indefinite-lived intangible assets until either the project underlying it is completed or the asset becomes impaired and is subsequently written-off. we test our in-process research and development intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, and more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. when we determine that an indefinite-lived intangible asset has become impaired or we abandon the associated research and development project, we write down the carrying value to its fair value and record an impairment charge in the period in which the impairment occurs. for example, we recorded a $13.0 million impairment of an in-process research and development intangible asset to "research and development expenses" in 2022 due to a decision to revise the scope of certain acquired gene-editing programs. if one of our product candidates achieves regulatory approval, the in-process research and development intangible assets associated with the product candidate become finite-lived intangible assets as described below.
to determine the fair value of our in-process research and development assets, we have utilized either the multi-period excess earnings or the relief from royalty methods of the income approach. each method requires us to estimate the probability of technical and regulatory success, revenue projections and growth rates, and appropriate discount and tax rates.
the multi-period excess earnings method also requires us to estimate development and commercial costs. the relief from royalty method also requires us to estimate the after-tax royalty savings expected from ownership of the asset that we acquired.
contingent consideration as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, we had $77.4 million and $129.0 million, respectively, of liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets attributable to the fair value of the contingent development and regulatory payments that we may owe to exonics' former equity holders upon the achievement of certain events associated with research programs focused on dmd and other severe neuromuscular diseases, including dm1.
we record an increase or a decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet and in our consolidated statement of income on a quarterly basis. we determine the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities using a probability weighted discounted cash flow method of the income approach, which requires us to make estimates of the timing of regulatory and commercial milestone achievement and the corresponding estimated probability of technical and regulatory success rates. we use significant judgment in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions during each reporting period. reasonable changes in these assumptions can cause material changes to the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities. due to the early stage of exonics' programs, these significant assumptions could be affected by future economic and market conditions.
in november 2023, we determined that additional pre-clinical studies of the delivery system for our gene-editing components for dmd will be required. as a result, we revised our estimates regarding the timing of the development and regulatory milestones and the probability of achieving those milestones, which reduced the estimated fair value of our contingent consideration as of december 31, 2023.
goodwill as of december 31, 2023 and 2022, we had goodwill of $1.1 billion on our consolidated balance sheets. during 2023, we did not have any business combinations. in 2022, we recorded $85.8 million of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet related to our acquisition of viacyte. goodwill reflects the difference between the fair value of the consideration transferred and the fair value of the net assets acquired. thus, the goodwill that we record is dependent on the significant judgments and estimates inherent in these fair values. we have one reporting unit for goodwill reporting purposes. we evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, and more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. we have not identified any goodwill impairment to date.
finite-lived intangible assets as of december 31, 2023, we had $236.3 million of finite-lived intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet within "other intangible assets, net." these finite-lived intangible assets, which were recorded during 2023, relate to $208.0 million of casgevy regulatory approval milestones, including $200.0 million we paid to crispr pursuant to the a&r jdca, and $30.0 million for a non-exclusive sublicense of developed technology related to casgevy.
we amortize our finite-lived intangible assets using the straight-line method within "cost of sales" over the remaining estimated life of the assets beginning in the period in which regulatory approval is achieved or the assets are acquired and continuing through the period that we no longer have either exclusive rights to market the products associated with the assets or in-license rights to the intellectual property underlying the assets. we test finite-lived intangible assets for impairment if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. if we determine that the carrying value of a finite-lived intangible asset may not be recoverable, we compare the carrying value of the asset to the undiscounted cash flows that we expect the asset to generate. when we determine that a finite-lived intangible asset has become impaired, we write down the carrying value of the asset to its fair value and record an impairment charge in the period in which the impairment occurs.
income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. if our estimate of the tax effect of reversing temporary differences is (i) not reflective of actual outcomes, (ii) modified to reflect new developments or interpretations of the tax law, or (iii) revised to incorporate new accounting principles, or changes in the expected timing or manner of the reversal, our results of operations could be materially impacted.
we provide a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. on a periodic basis, we reassess our valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets, weighing positive and negative evidence to assess the recoverability of the deferred tax assets. significant judgment is required in making these assessments to maintain or adjust our valuation allowances and, to the extent our future expectations change we would have to assess the recoverability of these deferred tax assets at that time. as of december 31, 2023, we maintained a valuation allowance of $266.6 million related primarily to u.s. state tax attributes.
we record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. we adjust our liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the uncertain positions. we are subject to tax laws and audits in multiple jurisdictions and significant judgment is required in making this assessment. consequently, we regularly re-evaluate uncertain tax positions and consider various factors, including changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position. as of december 31, 2023, our liability for uncertain tax positions was $615.9 million.

overview servicenow is a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions that define, structure, manage and automate services for global enterprises. we help our customers improve service quality and reduce costs while scaling and automating their businesses.
we generally offer our services on an annual subscription fee basis, which includes access to the ordered subscription service and related support, including updates to the subscription service during the subscription term. we provide a scaled pricing model based on the duration of the subscription term, and we frequently extend discounts to our customers based on the number of users. we generate sales through our direct sales team and, to a lesser extent, indirectly through resale partners and third-party referrals. we also generate revenues from professional services and for training of customer and partner personnel. we generally bill our customers annually in advance for subscription services and monthly in arrears for our professional services as the work is performed.
a majority of our revenues come from large global enterprise customers. we continue to invest in the development of our services, infrastructure and sales and marketing to drive long-term growth. we increased our overall employee headcount to 6,222 as of december 31, 2017 from 4,801 as of december 31, 2016.
new revenue recognition standard under topic 606
in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board issued a new standard related to revenue recognition from contracts with customers (topic 606), which is effective beginning january 1, 2018. topic 606 supersedes the prior revenue recognition standard (topic 605) for periods beginning january 1, 2018. the most significant impacts of the standard relate to the timing of revenue recognition related to our on-premises offerings, in which we grant customers the right to deploy our software on the customer's own servers without significant penalty, the accounting for incremental costs to obtain a contract and the classification of proceeds from knowledge and other user forums as a reduction in sales and marketing expenses instead of professional services and other revenues.
our results of operations below are presented under topic 605. our expectations for 2018 revenues, cost of revenues and operating expenses, including the comparison period amounts used to derive the expected trends, are based on topic 606. in addition, our expectations for 2018 revenues, cost of revenues and operating expenses are based on foreign exchange rates as of december 31, 2017. refer to note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for details regarding topic 606, including adjusted amounts for historical periods.
key business metrics number of customers with acv greater than $1 million. we count the total number of customers with annualized contract value (acv) greater than $1 million as of the end of the period. we had 500, 350 and 231 customers with acv greater than $1 million as of december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. for purposes of customer count, a customer is defined as an entity with a unique dunn & bradstreet global ultimate (gult), data universal numbering system (duns) number and an active subscription contract as of the measurement date. the duns number is a global standard for business identification and tracking. we make exceptions for holding companies, government entities and other organizations for which the gult, in our judgment, does not accurately represent the servicenow customer. for example, while all u.s. government agencies roll up to "government of the united states" under the gult, we count each government agency that we contract with as a separate customer. our customer count is subject to adjustments for acquisitions, spin-offs and other market activity. previously disclosed number of customers with acv greater than $1 million as well as our average contract term calculations are restated to allow for comparability. acv is calculated based on the foreign exchange rate in effect at the time the contract was signed. foreign exchange rate fluctuations could cause some variability in the number of customers with acv greater than $1 million.
26
g2k customer count. the global 2000 (g2k) customer count is defined as the total number of g2k companies in our customer base as of the end of the period. the forbes global 2000 is an annual ranking of the top 2,000 public companies in the world by forbes magazine. the ranking is based on a mix of four metrics: sales, profit, assets, and market value. the forbes global 2000 is updated annually in the second quarter of the calendar year. current and prior period g2k customer counts are based on the most recent list for comparability purposes. we adjust the g2k count for acquisitions, spin-offs and other market activity. for example, we add a g2k customer when a g2k company that is not our customer acquires a company in our existing customer base that is not a g2k company. when we enter into a contract with a g2k parent company, or any of its related subsidiaries, or any combination of entities within a g2k company, we count only one g2k customer. we do not count further penetration into entities within a given g2k as a new customer in the g2k customer count. our g2k customer count also excludes customers that have only purchased our express product offering, which is our entry-level it service management solution. our g2k customer count was 840, 737 and 637 as of december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
average acv per g2k customer. we calculate average acv for our g2k customers by taking aggregate acv from g2k customers as of the end of the period divided by the total number of g2k customers as of the end of the period. acv is calculated based on the foreign exchange rate in effect at the time the contract was entered into, and as a result, foreign currency rate fluctuations could cause variability in the average acv per g2k customer. prior g2k customer counts used in calculating acv per g2k are adjusted for the most recent forbes global 2000 list for comparability purposes. our average acv per g2k customer was approximately $1.3 million, $1.1 million and $0.9 million as of december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
renewal rate. we calculate our renewal rate by subtracting our attrition rate from 100%. our attrition rate for a period is equal to the acv from customers lost during the period, divided by the total acv from all customers that renewed during the period, excluding changes in price or users, and total acv from all customers lost during the period. accordingly, our renewal rate is calculated based on acv and is not based on the number of customers that have renewed. a lost customer is a customer that did not renew an expiring contract and that, in our judgment, will not be renewed. typically, a customer that reduces its subscription upon renewal is not considered a lost customer. however, in instances where the subscription decrease represents the majority of the customer's acv, we may deem the renewal as a lost customer. for our renewal rate calculation, we define a customer as an entity with a separate production instance of our service and an active subscription contract as of the measurement date, instead of an entity with a unique gult or duns number. our renewal rate was 97% for the year ended december 31, 2017 and 98% for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015. as our renewal rate is impacted by the timing of renewals, which could occur in advance of, or subsequent to the original contract end date, period-to-period comparison of renewal rates may not be meaningful.
billings. we define billings, a non-gaap financial measure, as revenues recognized plus the change in total deferred revenue as presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows. the change in total deferred revenue as presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows represents the change in deferred revenues in local currencies translated into u.s. dollars using an average foreign currency exchange rate, and aligns actual billings with the exchange rates in effect at the time of the billings. we believe billings is a useful leading indicator regarding the performance of our business.
a calculation of billings is provided below:

billings consists of amounts invoiced for subscription contracts with existing customers, renewals, upsells and new customers, and contracts for professional services, training, and our knowledge and other user forum events. factors that may cause our billings results to vary from period to period include the following:
•   billings duration. while we typically bill customers annually for our subscription services, customers sometimes request, and we accommodate, billings with durations less than or greater than the typical 12-month term.
27
•   contract start date. from time to time, we enter into contracts with a contract start date in the future, and we exclude these amounts from billings as these amounts are not included in our consolidated balance sheets, unless such amounts have been paid as of the balance sheet date.
•   foreign currency exchange rates. while a majority of our billings have historically been in u.s. dollars, an increasing percentage of our billings in recent periods has been in foreign currencies, particularly the euro and british pound sterling.
•   timing of contract renewals. while customers typically renew their contracts at the end of the contract term, from time to time customers may do so either before or after the scheduled expiration date. for example, in cases where we are successful in upselling additional products or services, a customer may decide to renew its existing contract early to ensure that all its contracts expire on the same date. in other cases, prolonged negotiations or other factors may result in a contract not being renewed until after it has expired.
accordingly, while we believe billings is a useful leading indicator regarding the performance of our business, an increase or decrease in new or renewed subscriptions in a reporting period may not have an immediate impact on billings for that reporting period.
to facilitate greater year-over-year comparability in our billings results, we disclose the impact that foreign currency rate fluctuations and fluctuations in billings duration had on our billings. the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations is calculated by translating the current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than u.s. dollars into u.s. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the prior period presented, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the current period. the impact of fluctuations in billings duration is calculated by replacing the portion of multi-year billings in excess of 12 months during the current period with the portion of multi-year billings in excess of 12 months during the prior period presented. notwithstanding the adjustments described above, the comparability of billings results from period to period remains subject to the impact of variations in the dollar value of contracts with future start dates and the timing of contract renewals, for which no adjustments have been presented.
foreign currency rate fluctuations had a favorable impact of $8.3 million and an unfavorable impact of $8.4 million on billings for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. changes in billings duration had a favorable impact of $1.6 million and $16.3 million for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board issued a new standard related to revenue recognition from contracts with customers (topic 606), which is effective beginning on january 1, 2018. under topic 606, due to the change in timing of revenue recognition under certain of our contracts, our definition of billings will be revenues recognized plus the change in total deferred revenue, unbilled receivables, and customer deposits as presented on or derived from our consolidated statements of cash flows. refer to note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for details regarding topic 606.
free cash flow. we define free cash flow, a non-gaap financial measure, as gaap net cash provided by operating activities reduced by purchases of property and equipment. purchases of property and equipment are otherwise included in cash used in investing activities under gaap. we believe information regarding free cash flow provides useful information to investors because it is an indicator of the strength and performance of our business operations. however, our calculation of free cash flow may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. a calculation of free cash flow is provided below:

average contract term. we calculate the average contract term for new customers, upsells and renewals based on the term of those contracts entered into during the period weighted by their acv. the average new customer contract term was 32 months for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. the average upsell contract term was 26 months for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. the average renewal contract term was 27 months, 28 months, and 25 months for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
components of results of operations revenues subscription revenues. subscription revenues are primarily comprised of fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service, and related support and updates, if any, to the subscription service during the subscription term. pricing includes multiple instances, hosting and support services, data backup and disaster recovery services, as well as future updates, when and if available, offered during the subscription term. we typically invoice our customers for subscription fees in annual increments upon execution of the initial contract or subsequent renewal. our contracts are generally non-cancelable during the subscription term, though a customer can terminate for breach if we materially fail to perform.
professional services and other revenues. professional services revenues consist of fees associated with professional services. our arrangements for professional services are primarily on a time-and-materials basis. we generally invoice our professional services monthly in arrears based on actual hours and expenses incurred. other revenues primarily consist of fees from customer training delivered on-site or through publicly available classes and registration and sponsorship fees for our annual knowledge user conference and other user forums. typical payment terms require our customers to pay us within 30 days of invoice.
we generate sales directly through our sales team and, to a lesser extent, through our resale partners. revenues from our direct sales organization represented 88% of our total revenues for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 and 89% of our total revenues for the year ended december 31, 2015. we make sales to our resale partners at a discount and record those revenues at the discounted price when all revenue recognition criteria have been met. from time to time, other third parties provide us referrals for which we pay a referral fee. we include revenues associated with these referrals as part of revenues from our direct sales organization. referral fees paid to these third parties are between 5% and 15% of the customer's acv, depending on the level of activity these third parties perform in the sales process. we include these fees in sales and marketing expense.
allocation of overhead costs overhead costs associated with office facilities, it and certain depreciation related to infrastructure that is not dedicated for customer use or research and development use are allocated to cost of revenues and operating expenses based on headcount.
cost of revenues cost of subscription revenues. cost of subscription revenues consists primarily of expenses related to hosting our services and providing support to our customers. these expenses are comprised of data center capacity costs, which include facility costs associated with our data centers as well as interconnectivity between data centers, depreciation related to our infrastructure hardware equipment dedicated for customer use, amortization of intangible assets and personnel-related costs directly associated with data center operations and customer support, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation and allocated overhead.
cost of professional services and other revenues. cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of personnel-related costs directly associated with our professional services and training departments, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, the costs of contracted third-party partners, travel expenses and allocated overhead.
professional services are performed directly by our services team, as well as by contracted third-party partners. fees paid to third-party partners are primarily recognized as cost of revenues as the professional services are delivered. cost of revenues associated with our professional services engagements contracted with third-party partners as a percentage of professional services and other revenues was 19% for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 and 21% for the year ended december 31, 2015.
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our sales and marketing staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, commissions and stock-based compensation. sales and marketing expenses also include third-party referral fees, expenses related to our annual knowledge user conference, other marketing program expenses, which include events other than knowledge, and costs associated with purchasing advertising and marketing data, and allocated overhead.
29
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our research and development staff, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation and allocated overhead. research and development expenses also include data center capacity costs, costs associated with outside services contracted for research and development purposes, amortization of intangible assets and depreciation of infrastructure hardware equipment that is used solely for research and development purposes.
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses for our executive, finance, legal, human resources, facilities and administrative personnel, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, external legal, accounting and other professional services fees, other corporate expenses, amortization of intangible assets and allocated overhead.
legal settlements legal settlements consist of one-time aggregate charges related to the settlement agreements with hewlett packard enterprise company (hpe) and bmc software, inc. (bmc). refer to note 16 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for further details regarding these matters.
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes consists of federal, state and foreign income taxes. due to cumulative losses, we maintain a valuation allowance against our u.s. deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2017 and 2016. we consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including but not limited to earnings history, projected future outcomes, industry and market trends and the nature of each of the deferred tax assets in assessing the extent to which a valuation allowance should be applied against our u.s. deferred tax assets.

subscription revenues increased $518.2 million during the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to the prior year, driven by our upsells and an increase in customer count. we expect subscription revenues to grow in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues in the year ended december 31, 2018 as we continue to add new customers and upsell to existing customers.
subscription revenues consist of the following:

our service management products include our platform, itsm, itbm, customer service management, hr service delivery and security operations, which have similar features and functions and are generally priced on a per user basis. our itom products, which improve visibility, availability and agility of enterprise services, are generally priced on a per node basis.
professional services and other revenues increased $24.4 million during the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to the prior year, due to an increase in the services provided to our growing customer base. included within our total professional services and other revenues are the revenues from our annual knowledge user conference, which increased to $17.1 million during the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to $12.8 million in the prior year, due to an increase in registration and sponsorship fees in the current year.
we expect professional services and other revenues under topic 606 for the year ending december 31, 2018 to remain flat in absolute dollar terms when compared to professional services and other revenues for the year ended december 31, 2017, as adjusted for topic 606. this reflects our plan to focus on deploying our internal professional services organization as a strategic resource while relying on our partner ecosystem to contract directly with customers for service delivery. as described above under the section entitled "new revenue recognition standard under topic 606," with the adoption of topic 606, proceeds from knowledge and other user forums will be classified as a reduction in sales and marketing expense instead of as professional services and other revenues.
33
our international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues. revenues outside north america represented 33% and 32% of total revenues for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. because we primarily transact in foreign currencies for sales outside of the united states, the general weakening of the u.s. dollar relative to other major foreign currencies (primarily the euro and british pound sterling) from the year ended december 31, 2016 to the year ended december 31, 2017 had a favorable impact on our revenues. for entities reporting in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended december 31, 2017 at the average exchange rates in effect for the year ended december 31, 2016 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period, our reported subscription revenues would have been $6.3 million lower. the impact from the foreign currency movements from the year ended december 31, 2016 to the year ended december 31, 2017 is not material to professional services and other revenues.

cost of subscription revenues increased $80.2 million during the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of $30.8 million in personnel-related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $8.0 million in other overhead expenses and an increase of $6.9 million in stock-based compensation. in addition, there was an increase of $17.8 million in depreciation expense primarily due to purchases of infrastructure hardware equipment for our data centers, an increase of $7.2 million in data center capacity costs primarily due to the addition of new data centers and the expansion of existing data centers, and an increase of $2.3 million in amortization of intangibles as a result of acquisitions. service and technical support agreement and software subscription costs increased $5.0 million, and outside service costs increased $1.2 million during year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the prior year.
our subscription gross profit percentage increased to 82% for the year ended december 31, 2017, from 81% for the year ended december 31, 2016, due to improved data center utilization and economies of scale. we expect our cost of subscription revenues to increase in absolute dollar terms as we provide subscription services to more customers and increase the number of users within our customer instances, but we expect such increase to be at a slower rate than the increase in our subscription revenues, leading to a slight increase in our subscription gross profit percentage for the year ended december 31, 2018 as we continue to leverage the investments we have made in our existing data center infrastructure. to the extent future acquisitions are consummated, our cost of subscription revenues may increase due to additional non-cash charges associated with the amortization of intangible assets acquired.
cost of professional services and other revenues increased $20.9 million during the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of $11.7 million in personnel-related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $2.1 million in overhead expenses, and an increase of $1.0 million in stock-based compensation. outside service costs increased $4.6 million during year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased utilization of contracted third-party partners for the implementation and configuration of our subscription services.
34
our professional services and other gross profit percentage increased to 5% during the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to 3% in the prior year, primarily due to the increase in revenues from our annual knowledge user conference. costs associated with knowledge are included in sales and marketing expense. knowledge contributed $17.1 million, or 10 percentage points, to the professional services and other gross profit percentage for the year ended december 31, 2017. knowledge contributed $12.8 million, or 8 percentage points, to the professional services and other gross profit percentage for the year ended december 31, 2016.
the impact from the foreign currency movements from the year ended december 31, 2016 to the year ended december 31, 2017 is not material to cost of revenues.

sales and marketing expenses increased $246.2 million during the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of $120.7 million in personnel-related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $39.0 million in stock-based compensation, an increase of $22.0 million in overhead expenses, and an increase of $30.2 million in commission expense. commissions and referral fee expenses amounted to 7% of subscription revenues for each of the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016. expenses related to our annual knowledge user conference increased $8.2 million, from $24.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 to $32.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2017, due to a 29% increase in registrations year-over-year. other marketing program expenses, which include expenses related to events other than knowledge and costs associated with purchasing advertising and marketing data, increased $17.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the prior year. outside services increased $7.0 million primarily due to an increase in contractors and professional fees to support our sales and marketing functions.
because we primarily transact in foreign currencies for sales and marketing expenses outside of the united states, the general weakening of the u.s. dollar relative to other major foreign currencies from the year ended december 31, 2016 to the year ended december 31, 2017 had an unfavorable impact on our sales and marketing expenses. for entities reporting in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended december 31, 2017 at the average exchange rates in effect for the year ended december 31, 2016 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period, our sales and marketing expenses would have been $2.5 million lower.
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase for the year ended december 31, 2018 in absolute dollar terms when compared to sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december 31, 2017, as adjusted for topic 606, but decrease slightly as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to expand our direct sales force, increase our marketing activities, grow our international operations, build brand awareness and sponsor additional marketing events. as described above under the section entitled "new revenue recognition standard under topic 606," with the adoption of topic 606, proceeds from knowledge and other user forums will be classified as a reduction in sales and marketing expense instead of professional services and other revenues.

research and development expenses increased $92.3 million during the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of $60.2 million in personnel-related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $14.4 million in overhead expenses, and an increase of $10.3 million in stock-based compensation. outside services increased $3.6 million primarily due to an increase in contractors and consultants that support our research and development functions. research and development expenses also increased $1.8 million due to depreciation of infrastructure hardware equipment that are used solely for research and development purposes.
because we primarily transact in foreign currencies for research and development expenses outside of the united states, the general weakening of the u.s. dollar relative to other major foreign currencies from the year ended december 31, 2016 to the year ended december 31, 2017 had an unfavorable impact on our research and development expenses. for entities reporting in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended december 31, 2017 at the average exchange rates in effect for the year ended december 31, 2016 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period, our research and development expenses would have been $1.3 million lower.

general and administrative expenses increased $51.6 million during the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase of $22.4 million in personnel-related costs excluding stock-based compensation, an increase of $19.3 million in stock-based compensation, and an increase of $2.3 million in overhead expenses. software subscription costs increased $4.6 million, and outside services costs, which include costs related to contractors and consultants, increased $2.3 million to support our administrative function. amortization of intangibles increased $1.5 million, and acquisition-related costs increased $1.4 million from acquisitions in 2017.
the impact from the foreign currency movements from the year ended december 31, 2016 to the year ended december 31, 2017 is not material to general and administrative expenses.

stock-based compensation expense increased $76.5 million during the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount and increased weighted-average grant date fair value of equity awards.
stock-based compensation expense is inherently difficult to forecast due to fluctuations in our stock price. based upon our stock price as of december 31, 2017, we expect stock-based compensation expense to continue to increase for the year ended december 31, 2018 in absolute dollar terms, but decrease as a percentage of total revenues as we continue to grow.

interest income and other income (expense), net decreased $0.2 million during the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased foreign exchange loss, partially offset by increased interest income. foreign exchange losses increased $8.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the prior year as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. interest income increased $8.1 million due to the higher cash balances and higher yields on our invested balances during the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to the prior year.

our expanding international operations will continue to increase our exposure to currency risks, though we cannot presently predict the impact of this exposure on our consolidated financial statements. while we have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date, we currently expect to initiate a hedging program to hedge selected significant transactions denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar in 2018.

our effective tax rate was 0% for the year ended december 31, 2017 and 2016. our tax expense decreased $1.6 million during the year ended december 31, 2017, compared to the prior year, primarily due to the tax effects of unrealized gains in investment securities. see note 15 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes.
on december 22, 2017, the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act (the tax act) was enacted into law, changing how the u.s. imposes income tax on multinational corporations. significant changes include, but are not limited to, a reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, a transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings, and a transition from a worldwide to a territorial tax system. we are required to recognize the effect of the tax act in the period of enactment, such as remeasuring our u.s. deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.
in december 2017, the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no. 118, income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act (sab 118), which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend more than one year beyond the tax act enactment date. since the tax act was passed late in the fourth quarter of 2017, and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretation are expected over the next 12 months, we consider the accounting for deferred tax remeasurements, the impact of the transition of u.s. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and other provisions to be incomplete due to the forthcoming guidance and our ongoing analysis. we expect to complete our analysis within the measurement period in accordance with sab 118.
we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our u.s. federal and state deferred tax assets, and the significant components of the tax expense recorded are current cash taxes payable in various jurisdictions. the cash tax expenses are impacted by each jurisdiction's individual tax rates, laws on timing of recognition of income and deductions, and availability of net operating losses and tax credits. given the full valuation allowance, sensitivity of current cash taxes to local rules and our foreign structuring, we expect that our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates. prior to the enactment of the tax act, we considered earnings from foreign operations to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states. we are currently evaluating whether to change our indefinite reinvestment assertion in light of the tax act and consider that assessment to be incomplete as permitted under guidance issued by the sec. we expect to reach a final determination within the measurement period described above.

our international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues. revenues outside north america represented 32% and 30% of total revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. because we primarily transact in foreign currencies for sales outside of the united states, the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to other major foreign currencies (primarily euro and the british pound sterling) from the year ended december 31, 2015 to the year ended december 31, 2016 had an unfavorable impact on our revenues. for entities reporting in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, if we had translated our results for the year ended december 31, 2016 at the average exchange rates in effect for the year ended december 31, 2015 rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the period, our subscription revenues would have increased by an additional $6.3 million. the impact from the foreign currency movements from the year ended december 31, 2015 to the year ended december 31, 2016 is not material to professional services and other revenues.

our professional services and other gross profit percentage decreased to 3% during the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to 7% in the prior year, due to lower utilization rates as we invested in specialized resources to support our newer products and higher growth rate in our stock-based compensation of 14% compared to the growth rate in our professional services and other revenues of 7%, partially offset by the increase in revenues from our annual knowledge user conference. costs associated with knowledge are included in sales and marketing expense. knowledge contributed $12.8 million, or 8 percentage points, to the professional services and other gross profit percentage for the year ended december 31, 2016. knowledge contributed $10.9 million, or 7 percentage points, to the professional services and other gross profit percentage for the year ended december 31, 2015.

interest income and other income (expense), net increased $1.6 million during the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased interest income, partially offset by increased foreign exchange losses. we had foreign exchange losses of $2.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to gains of $0.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. interest income increased $3.7 million due to the higher yields during the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the prior year.

seasonality, cyclicality and quarterly trends we have historically experienced seasonality in terms of when we enter into customer agreements for our services. we sign a significantly higher percentage of agreements with new customers, as well as renewal agreements with existing customers, in the quarter ended december 31. the increase in customer agreements for the quarter ended december 31 is primarily a result of the terms of our commission plans, which incentivize our direct sales force to meet their annual quotas by december 31, and large enterprise account buying patterns typical in the software industry, which are driven primarily by the expiration of annual authorized budgeted expenditures. furthermore, we usually sign a significant portion of these agreements during the last month, and often the last two weeks, of each quarter. this seasonality in the timing of entering into customer contracts is sometimes not immediately apparent in our billings due to the fact that we exclude contracts with a future start date from our billings. similarly, this seasonality is reflected to a much lesser extent, and sometimes is not immediately apparent in our revenues, due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenues over the term of the subscription agreement, which is generally 12 to 36 months. although these seasonal factors are common in the technology industry, historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance.
our revenues have increased over the periods presented due to increased sales to new customers, as well as upsells to existing customers. our operating expenses have increased over the periods presented primarily due to increases in headcount and other related expenses to support our growth. we have historically seen an increase in marketing expenses in the quarter ended june 30, and a corresponding decrease in marketing expenses in the quarter ended september 30 due to the expenses incurred for our annual knowledge user conference. marketing expenses in the quarter ended december 31 are also historically higher due to user forums we conduct in that quarter. we anticipate operating expenses will continue to increase in future periods as we continue to focus on investing in the long-term growth of our business.
our free cash flow is impacted by the timing of collections and disbursements, including the timing of capital expenditures. we have historically seen higher collections in the quarter ended march 31 due to seasonality in timing of entering into customer contracts as described above.
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and cash generated from operations. as of december 31, 2017, we had $1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which $250.6 million represented cash held by foreign subsidiaries. $191.5 million of the $1.8 billion are denominated in currencies other than u.s. dollar. in addition, we had $391.4 million in long-term investments that provide additional capital resources. we do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations.
prior to the enactment of the tax act, we considered earnings from foreign operations to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states. we are currently evaluating whether to change our indefinite reinvestment assertion in light of the tax act and consider that assessment to be incomplete as permitted under guidance issued by the sec. we expect to reach a final determination within the measurement period in accordance with sab 118.
in november 2013, we issued the 2018 notes with an aggregate principal amount of $575.0 million. the 2018 notes mature on november 1, 2018 unless converted or repurchased in accordance with their terms prior to such date. in connection with the issuance of the 2018 notes, we entered into the 2018 note hedge transactions and 2018 warrant transactions with certain financial institutions (the option counterparties). we may elect to settle the 2018 notes in cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares. if the 2018 note hedges are exercised, we may elect to receive cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares.
the price of our common stock was greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price of the 2018 notes for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the quarters ended june 30, 2017, september 30, 2017 and december 31, 2017. therefore, the 2018 notes first became convertible at the holders' option beginning on july 1, 2017 and continue to be convertible at the holders' option through march 31, 2018. the impact of the conversion of the 2018 notes on our liquidity will depend on the settlement method we elect for each instrument described above. we currently intend to settle the principal amount of any converted 2018 notes in cash.
47
during the year ended december 31, 2017, we paid cash to settle an immaterial principal amount of the 2018 notes due to early conversion requests. based on additional conversion requests we have received through the filing date, we expect to settle in cash an aggregate of $37.3 million in principal amount of the 2018 notes during the first quarter of 2018 and $7.3 million in principal amount of the 2018 notes during the second quarter of 2018. we may receive additional conversion requests that require settlement in the second quarter or the remainder of the year 2018.
in may and june 2017, we issued the 2022 notes with an aggregate principal amount of $782.5 million. we currently intend to use approximately $575.0 million of the net proceeds from the 2022 notes to repay the 2018 notes. in connection with the issuance of the 2022 notes, we entered into the 2022 note hedge transactions and 2022 warrant transactions with certain financial institutions. refer to note 9 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements and the risk factors included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for additional information on the 2022 notes, the 2022 notes hedges and the 2022 warrants. in addition, in may 2017, we used approximately $55.0 million of the net proceeds from the 2022 notes to repurchase shares of our common stock sold by certain purchasers of the 2022 notes, and during the three months ended june 30, 2017, we used approximately $73.9 million to pay the cost of the 2022 note hedges (after such cost was partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of the 2022 warrants).
we anticipate our current cash and cash equivalents balance and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including the repayment of our 2018 notes, expansion of data centers, lease obligations, expenditures related to the growth of our headcount and the acquisition of fixed assets, intangibles, and investments in office facilities, to accommodate our growth for at least the next 12 months. whether these resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs beyond that period will depend on our growth, operating results, cash utilized for acquisitions and/or debt retirements if any are consummated, and the capital expenditures required to meet possible increased demand for our services. if we require additional capital resources to grow our business at any time in the future, we may seek to finance our operations from the current funds available or seek additional equity or debt financing.

(1)   during the year ended december 31, 2017, we adopted accounting standards update 2016-18, "statement of cash flows (topic 230): restricted cash," which requires that amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. we have adopted changes to the consolidated statements of cash flows on a retrospective basis. the impact of the adoption for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 is not material.
operating activities cash provided by operating activities mainly consists of our net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, amortization of premiums on investments, amortization of deferred commissions, amortization of issuance cost and debt discount, stock-based compensation, and changes in operating assets and liabilities during the year.
net cash provided by operating activities was $642.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 compared to $159.9 million for the prior year. the increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to a decrease in net loss by $302.7 million. the remaining change was due to an increase in non-cash adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operations and the favorable impact on operating cash flow from changes in operating assets and liabilities.
net cash provided by operating activities was $159.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to $317.8 million for the prior year. the decrease in operating cash flow was primarily due to $267.5 million cash paid for aggregate legal settlements during the year ended december 31, 2016 (refer to note 16 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k for further details). the remaining change was due to an increase in non-cash adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operations and the favorable impact on operating cash flow from changes in operating assets and liabilities.
48
investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2017 was $883.9 million compared to $108.2 million for the prior year. the increase in cash used in investing activities was mainly due to a $714.7 million increase in net purchases of investments, a $44.9 million increase in capital expenditures related to the purchases of infrastructure hardware equipment to support the expansion of our data centers as well as investments in leasehold improvements, furniture and equipment to support our headcount growth, a $23.9 million increase in business combinations, net of cash and restricted cash acquired, and a $4.3 million increase in purchases of strategic investments. the increase in cash used in investing activities was partially offset by a $12.1 million decrease in purchases of other intangibles.
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2016 was $108.2 million compared to $231.5 million for the prior year. the decrease in cash used in investing activities was mainly due to a $181.6 million decrease in net purchases of investments and a $10.0 million decrease in the purchases of strategic investments, partially offset by a $33.2 million increase in business combinations, net of cash and restricted cash acquired, a $17.0 million increase in purchases of other intangibles, and a $18.1 million increase in capital expenditures related to the purchase of infrastructure hardware equipment to support the expansion of our data centers as well as investments in leasehold improvements, furniture and equipment to support our headcount growth.
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2017 was $538.9 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of $55.8 million for the prior year. the change was primarily due to a $698.2 million increase in net proceeds from issuance of the 2022 notes and the 2022 note hedge and 2022 warrant transactions entered into during the year ended december 31, 2017 and a $16.2 million increase in proceeds from employee stock plans, partially offset by a $62.0 million increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards and a $55.0 million increase in cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock.
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31, 2016 was $55.8 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $80.3 million for the prior year. the change was primarily due to a $107.1 million increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards as a result of a policy change to net settle shares for all u.s. employees starting in 2016 and a $27.0 million decrease in proceeds from employee stock plans due to a reduction in the number of stock options issued in the last four years.

(2)   consists of future minimum payments under non-cancelable purchase commitments primarily related to data center and it operations and sales and marketing activities. not included in the table above are certain purchase commitments related to our future annual knowledge user conferences and other customer or sales conferences to be held in 2019 and 2020. if we were to cancel these contractual commitments as of december 31, 2017, we would have been obligated to pay cancellation penalties of approximately $13.9 million in aggregate.
(3)   for additional information regarding our convertible senior notes, refer to note 9 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
in addition to the obligations in the table above, approximately $4.8 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of december 31, 2017. it is uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled.
off-balance sheet arrangements during all periods presented, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. as such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships.
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. these items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences could be material.
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition we derive our revenues from two sources: (i) subscriptions and (ii) professional services and other. subscription revenues are primarily comprised of subscription fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service, related support and updates, if any, to the subscribed service during the subscription term.
50
our contracts typically do not give the customer the right to take possession of the software supporting the services. professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with services provided to customers for process design, implementation, configuration and optimization of our products. professional services and other revenues also include customer training and registration and sponsorship fees for our annual knowledge user conference and other user forums.
we commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are met:
•there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement;
•the service has been provided to the customer;
•the collection of related fees is reasonably assured; and
•the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable.
we use a signed contract together with a signed order form as evidence of an arrangement for a new customer. in subsequent transactions with an existing customer, including an upsell or a renewal, we consider the existing signed contract and either the new signed order form or new purchase order as evidence of an arrangement.
we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract term beginning on the commencement date of each contract, the date we make our services available to our customers. once our services are available to customers, we record amounts due in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue. to the extent we bill customers in advance of the contract commencement date, the accounts receivable and corresponding deferred revenue amounts are netted to zero on our consolidated balance sheets, unless such amounts have been paid as of the balance sheet date.
our professional services arrangements are primarily on a time-and-materials basis and revenues on these arrangements are recognized as the services are delivered. professional services revenues associated with fixed fee arrangements are recognized using a proportional performance model. in instances where certain milestones are required to be met before revenues are recognized, we defer professional services revenues and the associated costs until milestone criteria have been met.
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors such as past collection history with the customer and creditworthiness of the customer. if we determine collectibility is not reasonably assured, we defer revenue recognition until collectibility becomes reasonably assured. we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. our arrangements are generally non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions.
we have multiple element arrangements comprised of subscription fees and professional services. we account for subscription and professional services revenues as separate units of accounting. to qualify as a separate unit of accounting, the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis. we have concluded that our subscription service has standalone value as it is routinely sold separately by us. in addition, the applications offered through this subscription service are fully functional without any additional development, modification or customization. we provide customers access to our subscription service at the beginning of the contract term. in determining whether professional services have standalone value, we considered the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer's satisfaction with the professional services work. our professional services, including implementation and configuration services, are not so unique and complex that other vendors cannot provide them. in some instances, customers independently contract with third-party vendors to do the implementation and we regularly outsource implementation services to contracted third-party vendors. as a result, we concluded professional services, including implementation and configuration services, have standalone value.
the total arrangement consideration for a multiple element arrangement is allocated to the identifiable separate units of accounting based on a relative selling price hierarchy. we determined the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendor-specific objective evidence (vsoe) of selling price or third-party evidence (tpe) of selling price if vsoe does not exist. if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exists for a deliverable, the selling price is determined using the best estimate of selling price (besp). we determine the besp for each deliverable primarily by considering the historical selling price of these deliverables in similar transactions as well as other factors, including, but not limited to, market competition, review of stand-alone sales and current pricing practices. in determining the appropriate pricing structure, we consider the available information regarding the competitive pricing of similar products and marketing analysis.
51
in limited circumstances, we grant certain customers the right to deploy our subscription service on the customers' own servers. these arrangements are subject to software revenue recognition guidance since the customer deploys our software. as we never sell the non-software elements separately from the software elements, we have determined that we do not have sufficient vsoe of fair value for all undelivered non-software elements. consequently, we defer all revenue and related costs under the arrangement until the last element in the transaction has been delivered or starts to be delivered. once the delivery of the last element has commenced, we recognize the entire fee and related costs from the arrangement ratably over the remaining period of the arrangement.
deferred revenue consists primarily of payments received in advance of revenue recognition for our subscriptions and professional services and other revenues and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met.
deferred commissions deferred commissions are the incremental selling costs that are directly associated with our customer contracts and consist of sales commissions paid to our direct sales force and referral fees paid to independent third-parties. the majority of commissions and referral fees are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related customer contracts. we include amortization of deferred commissions in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. we believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the revenue is recognized. the commission payments are generally paid in full the month after the customer's initial service under the contract commences.
goodwill, intangible assets and other long lived assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. the allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, especially with respect to intangible assets. these estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions and information obtained from the management of the acquired company. critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets included, but are not limited to, cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, discount rates, the time and expense that would be necessary to recreate the assets and the profit margin a market participant would receive. these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.
we evaluate and test the recoverability of goodwill for impairment at least annually during our fourth quarter or more frequently if circumstances indicate that goodwill may not be recoverable. we perform the impairment testing by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we perform a goodwill impairment test. to calculate any potential impairment, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill over its fair value is recognized as an impairment loss, and the carrying value of goodwill is written down. we have determined that we have a single reporting unit. we have not recognized any impairment charges related to goodwill during the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 because the aggregate fair value of our company has consistently and materially exceeded the carrying value of our single reporting unit.
we periodically review the carrying amounts of long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. we measure the recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amount of each asset to the future undiscounted cash flows we expect the asset to generate. if we consider any of these assets to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. in addition, we periodically evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of long-lived assets to determine whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of depreciation or amortization. our intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives ranging from 18 months to ten years.
screening for and assessing whether impairment indicators exist or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred, including market conditions, operating fundamentals, competition and general economic conditions, requires significant judgment. additionally, changes in the technology industry occur frequently and quickly. therefore, there can be no assurance that a charge to operating expenses will not occur as a result of future goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets impairment tests.
52
stock-based compensation we recognize compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock units (rsus) on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting term of four years. for rsus granted with a performance condition, the expenses are recognized on a graded vesting basis over the vesting period, after assessing the probability of achieving requisite performance criteria. this has the impact of greater stock-based compensation expense during the initial years of the vesting period as stock-based compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award as though the award were, in substance, multiple awards. we recognize compensation expense related to shares issued pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan (espp) on a straight-line basis over the offering period. we estimate the fair value of options using the black-scholes options pricing model and fair value of rsu awards using the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. we recognize compensation expense net of estimated forfeiture activity, which is based on historical forfeiture rates. we evaluate the forfeiture rates at least annually or when events or circumstances indicate a change may be needed. this may cause a fluctuation in our stock-based compensation in the period of change.
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be reversed. we recognize the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates as income and expense in the period that includes the enactment date. a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. in determining the need for a valuation allowance, we consider future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law, carryforward periods and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.
our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. we recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. we measure the tax benefit recognized as the largest amount of benefit which is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. we recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our tax provision. significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. our evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law or guidance, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues. changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change, which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results.
we calculate the current and deferred income tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years and record adjustments based on filed income tax returns when identified. the amount of income taxes paid is subject to examination by u.s. federal, state and foreign tax authorities. the estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management's assessment of relevant risks, facts and circumstances existing at that time. to the extent the assessment of such tax position changes, we record the change in estimate in the period in which we make the determination.
new accounting pronouncements on december 22, 2017, the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act (the tax act) was enacted into law and significantly changed how the u.s. imposes income tax on multinational corporations. changes include, but are not limited to, a reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, a transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings, and a transition from a worldwide to a territorial tax system. we are required to recognize the effect of the tax act in the period of enactment, such as remeasuring our u.s. deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.
in december 2017, the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no. 118, income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act (sab 118), which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend more than one year beyond the tax act enactment date. since the tax act was passed late in the fourth quarter of 2017, and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretation are expected over the next 12 months, we consider the accounting for deferred tax remeasurements, the impact of the transition of u.s. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system and other provisions to be incomplete due to the forthcoming guidance and our ongoing analysis. we expect to complete our analysis within the measurement period in accordance with sab 118.
53
in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board issued a new standard related to revenue recognition from contracts with customers (topic 606), which is effective beginning january 1, 2018. topic 606 supersedes the prior revenue recognition standard (topic 605). under topic 606, for our on‐premises offerings, we will recognize a portion of the subscription revenue when the on-premises offering is made available, resulting in a larger amount of upfront subscription revenue, and a smaller amount of deferred revenue compared with topic 605, which required ratable revenue recognition over the contract period. due to the complexity of certain customer contracts, the actual revenue recognition treatment required under topic 606 will depend on contract-specific terms and may result in greater variability in revenue from period to period.
under topic 606, we will defer all incremental commission costs to obtain customer contracts, including indirect costs that are not tied to a specific contract. on initial contracts, only the portion equivalent to a renewal commission will be amortized over the contract term, while the portion incremental to a renewal commission will be amortized over a period of benefit that we have determined to be five years. on renewal contracts, these costs will be amortized over the renewal term. additionally, for our on-premises offerings, consistent with the recognition of subscription revenue for on-premises offerings as described above, a portion of the commission costs will be expensed upfront when the on-premises offering is made available. under topic 605, we deferred only direct and incremental commission costs to obtain a contract and amortized those costs over the contract term, which is generally 12 to 36 months.
for details regarding these and other recently issued accounting standards, refer to note 2, summary of significant accounting policies, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.

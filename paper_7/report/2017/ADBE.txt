item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.
acquisitions during fiscal 2017, we completed our acquisition of tubemogul, a publicly held video advertising platform company, for $560.8 million. as of the end of fiscal 2017, we are continuing to integrate tubemogul into our digital marketing reportable segment.
during fiscal 2015, we completed our acquisition of privately held fotolia, a leading marketplace for royalty-free photos, images, graphics and hd videos, for $807.5 million. during fiscal 2015, we integrated fotolia into our digital media reportable segment.
we also completed other immaterial business acquisitions during the fiscal years presented. pro forma information has not been presented for any of our fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 acquisitions as the impact to our consolidated financial statements was not material.
see note 2 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these acquisitions.
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the sec, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. we base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. on a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates. we also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors.
we believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. these areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.
revenue recognition our revenue is derived from the subscription, non-software related hosted services, perpetual and term-based licensing of software products, associated software maintenance and support plans, consulting services, training and technical support. most of our enterprise customer arrangements are complex, involving multiple solutions and various license rights, bundled with post-contract customer support and other meaningful rights that together provide a complete end-to-end solution to the customer. throughout the contract period, customers use our solutions to complete various phases of the creative and/or marketing processes allowing them to concurrently work on multiple projects. in response to evolving customer and market expectations, we frequently expand and improve our technology to keep up with the pace of change, to provide enhancements to our tools to meet industry needs and to provide support at each stage of the customer's life cycle.
we recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; we have delivered the product or performed the service; the fee is fixed or determinable; and collection is probable. determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report.
we enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of software, upgrades, maintenance and support, hosted services and consulting.
for our software and software-related multiple element arrangements, we must: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services; (3) determine the fair value of each undelivered element using vendor-specific objective evidence ("vsoe"); and (4) allocate the total price among the various elements. vsoe of fair value is used to allocate a portion of the price to the undelivered elements and the residual method is used to allocate the remaining portion to the delivered elements. absent vsoe, revenue is deferred until the earlier of the point at which vsoe of fair value exists for any undelivered element or until all elements of the arrangement have been delivered. however, if the only undelivered element is maintenance and support, the entire
35
arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period.
we determine vsoe for each element based on historical stand-alone sales to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the elements contained in the initial arrangement. in determining vsoe, we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range.
we have established vsoe for our software maintenance and support services, custom software development services, consulting services and training, when such services are sold optionally with software licenses.
for multiple-element arrangements containing our non-software services, we must: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of vsoe of selling price, third-party evidence ("tpe") of selling price or best-estimated selling price ("besp"), as applicable; and (3) allocate the total price among the various elements based on the relative selling price method.
for multiple-element arrangements that contain both software and non-software elements, we allocate revenue to software or software-related elements as a group and any non-software elements separately based on the selling price hierarchy. we determine the selling price for each deliverable using vsoe of selling price, if it exists, or tpe of selling price. if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exist for a deliverable, we use besp. once revenue is allocated to software or software-related elements as a group, we recognize revenue in conformance with software revenue accounting guidance. revenue is recognized when revenue recognition criteria are met for each element.
we are generally unable to establish vsoe or tpe for non-software elements and as such, we use besp. besp is generally used for offerings that are not typically sold on a stand-alone basis or for new or highly customized offerings. we determine besp for a product or service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, major product groupings, geographies, market conditions, competitive landscape, internal costs, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. pricing practices taken into consideration include historic contractually stated prices, volume discounts where applicable and our price lists. we must estimate certain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers. while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. accordingly, our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenue could differ from actual events, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.
product revenue is recognized when the above criteria are met. we reduce the revenue recognized for estimated future returns, rebates and price protection at the time the related revenue is recorded. in determining our estimate for returns and in accordance with our internal policy regarding global channel inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by our distributors on which we have recognized revenue, we rely upon historical data, the estimated amount of product inventory in our distribution channel, the rate at which our product sells through to the end user, product plans and other factors. our estimated provisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs. product returns may be more or less than what was estimated. the amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated. our estimate of the rate of sell-through for product in the channel could be different than what actually occurs. these factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual returns, thus impacting our financial position and results of operations.
in the future, actual returns and price protection may exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences, market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms, product updates or competing products. while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. accordingly, if our estimates change, our returns and price protection reserves would change, which would impact the total net revenue we report.
we recognize revenue for hosted services that are priced based on a committed number of transactions ratably beginning on the date the services associated with the committed transactions are first made available to the customer and continuing through the end of the contractual service term. over-usage fees, and fees billed based on the actual number of transactions from which we capture data, are billed in accordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred. we record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met.
our consulting revenue is recognized on a time and materials basis and is measured monthly based on input measures, such as on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable.
36
accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. in addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset.
our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. we have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. in addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the u.s. internal revenue service ("irs") and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. we expect future examinations to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters. we regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from such examinations. we believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, the final determination of any of these examinations could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.
our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income, such as income from operations or capital gains income. actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate. any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.
we are a united states-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple u.s. and foreign tax jurisdictions. a significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our irish subsidiaries. in addition to providing for u.s. income taxes on earnings from the united states, we provide for u.s. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries' earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the united states. while we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings as of the balance sheet date, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related u.s. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings.
our income tax expense has differed from the tax computed at the u.s. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to discrete items and to earnings considered as permanently reinvested in foreign operations. unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations. our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, by changes in or our interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, by unanticipated decreases in the amount of earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates, by unexpected negative changes in business and market conditions that could reduce certain tax benefits, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.
in addition, in the united states, the european commission, countries in the european union and other countries where we do business, we are subject to potential changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as adobe. these countries and other governmental bodies have or could make unprecedented assertions about how earnings in their jurisdictions might be determined that are contrary to the way in which we have interpreted and historically applied the rules and regulations described above in our income tax returns filed in such jurisdictions. in the current global tax policy environment, any changes in laws, regulations and interpretations related to these assertions could adversely affect our effective tax rates or result in other costs to us, which could adversely affect our operations and financial results.
moreover, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. these tax examinations are expected to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters. we regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for adjustments that may result from these examinations. we cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.

results of operations overview of 2017
for fiscal 2017, we reported strong financial results consistent with the continued execution of our long-term plans for our two strategic growth areas, digital media and digital marketing, while continuing to market and license a broad portfolio of products and solutions.
in our digital media segment, we are a market leader with creative cloud, our subscription-based offering for creating and publishing content and applications. creative cloud delivers value through frequent product updates, storage and access to user files stored in the cloud with syncing of files across users' machines, access to marketplace, social and community-based features with our adobe stock and behance services, app creation capabilities and affordable pricing for cost-sensitive customers.
we offer creative cloud for individuals, students, teams and enterprises. we expect creative cloud will drive sustained long-term revenue growth through a continued expansion of our customer base by acquiring new users on account of creative cloud's low cost of entry and delivery of additional features and value, as well as keeping existing customers current on our latest release. we have also built out a marketplace for creative cloud subscribers to enable the delivery and purchase of stock content in our adobe stock service. overall, our strategy with creative cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with users, attract more new customers, and grow a recurring and predictable revenue stream that is recognized ratably.
we continue to implement strategies that will accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of subscriptions to our creative cloud offerings. these strategies include increasing the value creative cloud users receive, such as offering new mobile applications, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract past customers and potential users to try out and ultimately subscribe to creative cloud. because of the shift towards creative cloud subscriptions and enterprise term license agreements ("etlas"), revenue from perpetual licensing of our creative products has been immaterial to our business.
we are also a market leader with our adobe document cloud offerings built around our adobe acrobat family of products, the adobe reader and a set of integrated cloud-based document services, including adobe sign. acrobat provides reliable creation and exchange of electronic documents, regardless of platform or application source type. document cloud, which we believe enhances the way people manage critical documents at home, in the office and across devices, includes adobe acrobat dc and adobe sign, and a set of integrated services enabling users to create, review, approve, sign and track documents whether on a desktop or mobile device. adobe acrobat dc, with a touch-enabled user interface, is offered both through subscription and perpetual licenses.
annualized recurring revenue ("arr") is currently the key performance metric our management uses to assess the health and trajectory of our overall digital media segment. arr should be viewed independently of revenue, deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue as arr is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. we adjust our reported arr on an annual basis to reflect any material exchange rates changes. our reported arr results in fiscal 2017 are based on currency rates set at the start of fiscal 2017 and held constant throughout the year. we calculate arr as follows:
creative arr         annual value of creative cloud subscriptions and services+ annual digital publishing suite contract value + annual creative etla contract value document cloud arr   annual value of document cloud subscriptions and services +annual document cloud etla contract value digital media arr    creative arr+ document cloud arr
38
creative arr exiting fiscal 2017 was $4.63 billion, up from $3.52 billion at the end of fiscal 2016. document cloud arr exiting fiscal 2017 was $600 million, up from $472 million at the end of fiscal 2016. total digital media arr grew to $5.23 billion at the end of fiscal 2017, up from $3.99 billion at the end of fiscal 2016. revaluing our ending arr for fiscal 2017 using currency rates at the beginning of fiscal 2018, our digital media arr at the end of fiscal 2017 would be $5.39 billion or approximately $154 million higher than the arr reported above.
our success in driving growth in arr has positively affected our revenue growth. creative revenue in fiscal 2017 was $4.17 billion, up from $3.18 billion in fiscal 2016 and representing 31% year-over-year growth. document cloud revenue in fiscal 2017 was $836.7 million, up from $764.9 million in fiscal 2016 and representing 9% year-over-year revenue growth as we continue to transition document cloud to a subscription-based model. total digital media segment revenue grew to $5.01 billion in fiscal 2017, up from $3.94 billion in fiscal 2016 and representing 27% year-over-year growth.
we are a market leader in the fast-growing category addressed by our digital marketing segment. our digital marketing business provides comprehensive solutions that include analytics, social marketing, targeting, media optimization, digital experience management, cross-channel campaign management, audience management, premium video delivery and monetization. these comprehensive solutions enable marketers to measure, personalize and optimize marketing campaigns and digital experiences across channels for optimal marketing performance. in march 2017, we migrated our hierarchy of solutions under what was formerly known as adobe marketing cloud to our next generation offering referred to as adobe experience cloud.
adobe experience cloud consists of the following cloud offerings:
•   adobe marketing cloud-provides an integrated set of solutions to help marketers differentiate their brands and engage their customers, helping businesses manage, personalize, and orchestrate campaigns and customer journeys; includes adobe experience manager ("aem"), adobe campaign, adobe target, adobe social and adobe primetime.
•   adobe analytics cloud-enables businesses to move from insights to actions in real time by uniquely integrating audiences as the core system of intelligence for the enterprise; makes data available across all adobe clouds through the capture, aggregation, rationalization and understanding of vast amounts of disparate data and then translating that data into singular customer profiles; includes adobe analytics and adobe audience manager.
•   adobe advertising cloud-delivers an end-to-end platform for managing advertising across traditional tv and digital formats, and simplifies the delivery of video, display and search advertising across channels and screens; combines capabilities from adobe media optimizer ("amo") and adobe's acquisition of tubemogul during the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
in addition to chief marketing officers and digital marketers, users of our adobe experience cloud solutions include advertisers, campaign managers, digital marketers, publishers, data analysts, content managers, social marketers and marketing executives. these customers often are involved in workflows that utilize other adobe products, such as our digital media offerings. by combining the creativity of our digital media business with the science of our digital marketing business, we help our customers to more efficiently and effectively make, manage, measure and monetize their content across every channel with an end-to-end workflow and feedback loop.
we utilize a direct sales force to market and license our adobe experience cloud solutions, as well as an extensive ecosystem of partners, including marketing agencies, systems integrators and independent software vendors that help license and deploy our solutions to their customers. we have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market, and our recent financial results reflect the success of these investments. we achieved record adobe experience cloud revenue of $2.03 billion in fiscal 2017, which represents 24% year-over-year growth.
financial performance summary for fiscal 2017

fiscal 2017 revenue compared to fiscal 2016 revenue digital media revenue from digital media increased $1.07 billion during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016, primarily driven by increases in revenue associated with our creative offerings.
revenue associated with our creative offerings, which includes our creative cloud, perpetually licensed creative and stock photography offerings, increased during fiscal 2017. the increase was primarily due to an increase in subscription revenue associated with our creative cloud offerings driven by increases in individual, team and enterprise subscriptions. also contributing to the increase in revenue was revenue growth associated with our creative cloud photography plan subscription offering.
adobe document cloud revenue, which includes our acrobat product family and adobe sign service, increased during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to increases in document cloud subscriptions revenue, offset in part by expected declines in revenue associated with our perpetually licensed acrobat offering. also contributing to the increase in document cloud revenue was an increase in adobe sign revenue.
digital marketing revenue from digital marketing increased $383.4 million during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to subscription revenue growth associated with our adobe experience cloud. the increase in subscription revenue was driven by strong performance with our adobe marketing cloud offerings, which include aem and adobe campaign, and our adobe analytics cloud offerings, which includes audience manager. also contributing to the increase in adobe experience cloud revenue were increases in revenue associated with our adobe advertising cloud offerings, including tubemogul which we acquired in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.

during fiscal 2016, the u.s. dollar strengthened against the euro and british pound which negatively impacted revenue in emea measured in u.s. dollar equivalents. this impact was partially offset by hedging gains from our emea currencies hedging programs during fiscal 2016. during fiscal 2016, the u.s. dollar weakened against the japanese yen, the impact of which was offset by the impact of the u.s. dollar strengthening against other asian currencies.
see note 17 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further geographic information.
backlog deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet consists of billings and payments received in advance of revenue recognition for our products and solutions and does not represent the total contract value of existing annual or multi-year, non-cancelable commercial subscription, saas and managed services agreements or government contracts with fiscal funding clauses. unbilled deferred revenue represents expected future billings that are contractually committed under our existing subscription, saas and managed services agreements that have not been invoiced and are not recorded in deferred revenue within our financial statements. our presentation of unbilled deferred revenue backlog may differ from that of other companies in the industry. as of december 1, 2017, we had unbilled deferred revenue backlog of approximately $3.94 billion of which approximately 40% to 50% is not reasonably expected to be billed during fiscal 2018. comparatively, we had unbilled deferred revenue backlog of approximately $3.42 billion as of december 2, 2016, of which approximately 40% to 50% was not reasonably expected to be billed during fiscal 2017.
we expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue backlog will change from period to period due to certain factors, including the timing and duration of large customer subscriptions, saas and managed service agreements, varying billing cycles of these agreements, the timing of customer renewals, the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue backlog is to be billed, changes in customer financial circumstances and foreign currency fluctuations. additionally, the unbilled deferred revenue backlog for multi-year subscription agreements that are billed annually is typically higher at the beginning of the contract period, lower prior to renewal and typically increases when the agreement is renewed. accordingly, fluctuations in unbilled deferred revenue backlog may not be a reliable indicator of future business prospects and the related revenue associated with these contractual commitments.

amortization of purchased intangibles during the last several years, we have completed a number of business combinations and asset acquisitions. as a result of these acquisitions, we purchased intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to fourteen years.
amortization expense remained relatively consistent during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. the decreases associated with certain fully amortized acquired intangible assets from previous acquisitions were offset by increases associated with intangible assets purchased through our acquisition of tubemogul in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
amortization expense increased during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to the write-off of certain acquired intangible assets from a previous acquisition and the increase in amortization expense associated with intangible assets purchased in fiscal 2016.

interest and other income (expense), net interest and other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term fixed income investments. interest and other income (expense), net also includes gains and losses on fixed income investments and foreign exchange gains and losses other than any gains recorded to revenue from our hedging programs.
interest and other income (expense), net increased in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 due to higher average invested balances and interest rates and a decline in foreign exchange hedging costs.
interest and other income (expense), net decreased in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 due to a gain on the sale of certain property assets that occurred in fiscal 2015 and an increase in foreign exchange hedging costs, offset in part by an increase in interest income due to higher average invested balances and interest rates.
interest expense interest expense primarily represents interest associated with our senior notes and interest rate swaps. interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on february 1 and august 1. floating interest payments on the interest rate swaps are paid monthly. the fixed-rate interest receivable on the swaps is received semi-annually concurrent with the senior notes interest payments.  see notes 5 and 15 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further details regarding our interest rate swaps.

as described in note 1 of our notes to consolidated financial statements, we early adopted the updated accounting standard for share-based payment accounting during fiscal 2017. as a result, we recorded deferred tax attributes that we were previously tracking pursuant to the rules that preceded this standard. the deferred tax asset recorded with the adoption was offset by the establishment of a valuation allowance.
our effective tax rate increased by approximately two percentage points during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. the increase was partially related to a one-time tax cost associated with licensing acquired company assets to our trading subsidiaries, offset in part by the recognition of excess tax benefits due to our adoption of new accounting guidance related to stock-based compensation and the completion of certain income tax examinations. in addition to the above noted items, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 included tax benefits recognized as a result of the completion of certain income tax examinations, and to a lesser extent, a one-time tax benefit related to the retroactive reinstatement of the fiscal 2015 u.s. research and development credit.
our effective tax rate decreased by approximately nine percentage points during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. the decrease was primarily due to tax benefits recognized as a result of the completion of certain income tax examinations and the permanent extension of the u.s. research and development credit for 2015 and onward. the reinstatement of the credit was retroactive to january 1, 2015. a tax benefit for the credit relating to fiscal 2015 was reflected in its entirety in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. the decrease was partially offset by stronger domestic profits for fiscal 2016. in addition, the fiscal 2015 effective tax rate included one-time tax costs associated with licensing acquired company assets to adobe's trading companies, offset by tax benefits for the temporary reinstatement of the u.s. research and development credit in december 2014.
we are a united states-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple u.s. and foreign tax jurisdictions. a significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year was earned by our irish subsidiaries. in addition to providing for u.s. income taxes on earnings from the united states, we provide for u.s. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries' earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the united states. while we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings as of the balance sheet date, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related u.s. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings. currently, there is a significant amount of foreign earnings upon which u.s. income taxes have not been provided.
see note 9 of our notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our provision for income taxes.
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes the gross liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties were $172.9 million, $178.4 million and $258.7 million for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, of which, $135.0 million, $144.5 million and $220.2 million if recognized, would affect our effective tax rates for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which were net of the estimated $37.9 million, $33.9 million and $38.5 million federal benefits related to deducting certain payments on future federal and state tax returns for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
48
the combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns were approximately $23.6 million and $22.4 million for fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. these amounts were included in non-current income taxes payable in their respective years.
the timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. these events could cause large fluctuations in the balance of current and non-current assets, liabilities and income taxes payable. we believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. given the uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to approximately $40 million.

our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue. the primary uses of cash are payroll related expenses, general operating expenses including marketing, travel and office rent, and cost of revenue. other sources of cash are proceeds from participation in the employee stock purchase plan. other uses of cash include our stock repurchase program, which is described below, business acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment.
cash flows from operating activities for fiscal 2017, net cash provided by operating activities of $2.91 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. the primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue and accrued expenses. the increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased subscriptions for our creative cloud offerings and increases in digital marketing hosted services. the increase in accrued expenses is primarily due to the increase in accruals for compensation costs and employee benefits driven by headcount growth, and increased accrued media costs associated with our advertising cloud offerings, including tubemogul. the primary working capital uses of cash were increases in trade receivables, payments of trade payables assumed as part of the tubemogul acquisition, and a decrease in income taxes payable. trade receivables increased primarily due to revenue linearity, higher revenue levels, and increased media rebill receivables attributable to tubemogul. income taxes payable decreased primarily due to taxes paid in excess of the tax provision increase.
for fiscal 2016, net cash provided by operating activities of $2.20 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. the primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue and accrued expenses. the increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased subscriptions for our creative cloud offerings and increases in digital marketing hosted services. the increase in accrued expenses is primarily due to the increase in accruals for compensation costs and employee benefits driven by the increase in headcount. the primary working capital uses of cash were increases in trade receivables, prepaid expenses and other current assets, and a decrease in income taxes payable. trade receivables increased primarily due to higher revenue levels. prepaid expenses and other current assets increased
49
primarily due to advanced tax payments made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. income taxes payable decreased primarily due to the completion of certain income tax audits in fiscal 2016, offset in part by increases to the tax provision in excess of taxes paid.
for fiscal 2015, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.47 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. the primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue, income taxes payable and trade payables. the increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased subscriptions for our team, individual and enterprise creative cloud offerings and increases in digital marketing hosted services. the increase in income taxes payable was primarily due to higher taxable income levels during fiscal 2015. trade payables increased primarily due to the timing of payments to web services vendors as certain invoices were received in the final weeks of fiscal 2015. the primary working capital uses of cash were increases in trade receivables which were principally due to higher revenue levels.
cash flows from investing activities for fiscal 2017, net cash used for investing activities of $442.9 million was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments and our acquisition of tubemogul. other uses of cash included purchases of property and equipment, including the almaden tower and long-term investments and other assets. these cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments.
for fiscal 2016, net cash used for investing activities of $960.0 million was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments. other uses of cash represented purchases of property and equipment, purchases of long-term investments and other assets, and an immaterial acquisition. these cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments.
for fiscal 2015, net cash used for investing activities of $1.49 billion was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments and our acquisition of fotolia. other uses of cash during fiscal 2015 represented purchases of property and equipment and long-term investments and other assets. these cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments and proceeds received from the sale of certain property assets.
see note 2 and note 6 of our consolidated financial statements for more detailed information regarding our acquisitions and the almaden tower purchase, respectively.
cash flows from financing activities for fiscal 2017, net cash used for financing activities of $1.18 billion was primarily due to payments for our treasury stock repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock.
for fiscal 2016, net cash used for financing activities of $1.09 billion was primarily due to payments for our treasury stock repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
in january 2015, we issued $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due february 1, 2025 (the "2025 notes"). our proceeds were approximately $989.3 million which is net of an issuance discount of $10.7 million. in addition, we incurred issuance costs of $7.9 million. both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2025 notes using the effective interest method. the 2025 notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
we used $600 million of the proceeds from the 2025 notes offering to repay the outstanding balance plus accrued and unpaid interest of the $600 million 3.25% senior notes due february 1, 2015 ("2015 notes"). the remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.  see note 15 of our consolidated financial statements for more detailed information.
in addition to the 2025 notes issuance and 2015 notes repayment, other financing activities during fiscal 2015 included payments for our treasury stock repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. see the section titled "stock repurchase program" discussed below.
we expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments, venture capital, facilities expansion and purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and administrative staff. furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to strategically acquire companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business.
other liquidity and capital resources considerations our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may fluctuate during fiscal 2018 due to changes in our planned cash outlay, including changes in incremental costs such as direct and integration costs related to our acquisitions. our cash and
50
investments totaled $5.82 billion as of december 1, 2017. of this amount, approximately 89% was held by our foreign subsidiaries and subject to material repatriation tax effects. as of our balance sheet date, our intent is to permanently reinvest a significant portion of our earnings from foreign operations, and current plans do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations. in the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the united states and if u.s. tax has not already been previously provided, we would provide for and pay additional u.s. taxes in connection with repatriating these funds.
subsequent to december 1, 2017, the "tax cuts and jobs act" (the "act") was enacted and included broad tax reforms that are applicable to adobe. under the provisions of the act, the u.s. corporate tax rate decreased from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018, our undistributed foreign earnings amount of approximately $4 billion are subject to taxation in fiscal 2018 and are available for repatriation, and our future foreign earnings are subject to u.s. taxation. these changes will require us to remeasure our deferred tax assets and liabilities and reclassify approximately $380 million of deferred tax liabilities related to undistributed foreign earnings to long-term income taxes payable due over eight years. in addition, based on preliminary estimates, we anticipate a tax provision charge of approximately $85 million in fiscal 2018 predominately due to the taxation of undistributed foreign earnings.
cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed in part i, item 1a titled "risk factors." however, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months.
on march 2, 2012, we entered into a five-year $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (the "credit agreement"), providing for loans to us and certain of our subsidiaries. on march 1, 2013, we exercised our option under the credit agreement to extend the maturity date of the credit agreement by one year to march 2, 2018. on july 27, 2015, we entered into an amendment to further extend the maturity date of the credit agreement to july 27, 2020 and reallocated the facility among the syndicate of lenders that are parties to the credit agreement. as of december 1, 2017, there were no outstanding borrowings under this credit agreement and the entire $1 billion credit line remains available for borrowing.
as of december 1, 2017, the amount outstanding under our senior notes was $1.9 billion, consisting of $900 million of 4.75% senior notes due february 1, 2020 (the "2020 notes") and $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due february 1, 2025 (together with the 2020 notes, the "notes").
our short-term investment portfolio is primarily invested in corporate bonds and commercial paper, u.s. treasury securities, foreign government securities, municipal securities and asset-backed securities. we use professional investment management firms to manage a large portion of our invested cash.
stock repurchase program to facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, we may repurchase shares in the open market or enter into structured repurchase agreements with third parties. in january 2017, our board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program granting us authority to repurchase up to $2.5 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2019.
during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $1.10 billion, $1.08 billion, and $625 million, respectively. we enter into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the volume weighted average price ("vwap") of our common stock over a specified period of time. we only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is higher than our estimate of the expected foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. there were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us.
the financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. the parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the contract, the number of trading days in the interval and the average vwap of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount. during fiscal 2017, we repurchased approximately 8.2 million shares at an average price per share of $134.20 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016. during fiscal 2016, we repurchased approximately 10.4 million shares at an average price per share of $97.16 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015. during fiscal 2015, we repurchased approximately 8.1 million shares at an average price per share of $77.38 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014.
51
for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our consolidated balance sheets at the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by december 1, 2017, december 2, 2016 and november 27, 2015 were excluded from the computation of earnings per share. as of december 1, 2017, $101.5 million of prepayments remained under the agreement.
subsequent to december 1, 2017, as part of the 2017 stock repurchase authority, we entered into a structured stock repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $300 million. this amount will be classified as treasury stock on our consolidated balance sheets. upon completion of the $300 million stock repurchase agreement, $1.6 billion remains under our current authority.

senior notes as of december 1, 2017, our outstanding notes payable consist of the 2020 notes and 2025 notes with a total carrying value of $1.88 billion. interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears on february 1 and august 1. at december 1, 2017, our maximum commitment for interest payments under the notes was $350.6 million for the remaining duration of our notes. in june 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps that effectively converted the fixed interest rate on our 2020 notes to a floating interest rate based on the london interbank offered rate ("libor") plus a fixed number of basis points through february 1, 2020.
covenants our credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio. as of december 1, 2017, we were in compliance with this covenant. we believe this covenant will not impact our credit or cash in the coming fiscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. our notes do not contain any financial covenants.
under the terms of our credit agreement, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or one currently exists. we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes see results of operations - provision for income taxes above for our discussion on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes.
royalties we have certain royalty commitments associated with the licensing of certain offerings and products. royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit sold, or a percentage of the underlying revenue.
indemnifications in the normal course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations.
to the extent permitted under delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is or was serving at our request in such capacity. the indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the director's or officer's lifetime. the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.

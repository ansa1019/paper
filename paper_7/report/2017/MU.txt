operating segments and significant increases in sales volumes for both dram and trade nand products as well as increases in average selling prices for dram products. increases in sales volumes for 2017 as compared 2016 were enabled by higher manufacturing output due to improvements in product and process technology and solid execution.
total net sales for 2016 decreased 23% as compared to 2015 primarily due to lower cnbu, mbu, and sbu sales as declines in average selling prices outpaced increases in sales volumes. the increases in sales volumes for 2016 were primarily attributable to higher manufacturing output due to improvements in product and process technology partially offset by reductions resulting from technology node transitions.
gross margin our overall gross margin percentage increased to 42% for 2017 from 20% for 2016 reflecting increases in the gross margin percentages for all operating segments, primarily due to strong markets that drove favorable pricing conditions and to manufacturing cost reductions from improvements in product and process technology and solid execution.
our overall gross margin percentage declined to 20% for 2016 from 32% for 2015 primarily due to declines in the gross margin percentages for cnbu, mbu, and sbu, as decreases in average selling prices outpaced manufacturing cost reductions. ebu's gross margin percentage for 2016 was relatively unchanged from 2015 as manufacturing cost reductions offset declines in average selling prices.
we periodically assess the estimated useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. in the fourth quarter of 2016, we identified factors such as the lengthening period of time between dram product technology node transitions, an increased re-use rate of equipment, and industry trends. as a result, we revised the estimated useful lives of equipment in our dram wafer fabrication facilities from five to seven years in the fourth quarter of 2016. the effect of the revision was not material for 2016 and reduced depreciation costs by approximately $100 million per quarter in 2017.
from january 2013 through december 2015, we purchased all of inotera's dram output under supply agreements at prices reflecting discounts from market prices for our comparable components. after december 2015 through december 6, 2016, the date we acquired the remaining interest in inotera, the price for dram products purchased by us from inotera was based on a formula that equally shared margin between inotera and us. under these agreements, we purchased $504 million, $1.43 billion, and $2.37 billion of dram products from inotera in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, which represented 9% of our aggregate dram gigabit production for 2017, 30% for 2016, and 35% for 2015. in accounting for the inotera acquisition, inotera's work in process inventories were recorded at fair value, based on their estimated future selling prices, estimated costs to complete, and other factors, and was approximately $107 million higher than the cost of work in process inventory recorded by inotera prior to the acquisition. the acquired inventory was sold in 2017.

strong conditions in 2017 for enterprise, client, mobile, graphics, and networking markets as well as key customer qualifications drove increases in sales volumes and prices as compared to 2016. the reductions in cost for 2017 and 2016 as compared to prior years were primarily due to improvements in product and process technology. for 2017 compared to 2016, lower depreciation due to the change made in the fourth quarter of 2016 in estimated useful lives for equipment at our dram wafer fabrication facilities contributed to cost reductions.
our gross margin percentage on sales of dram products for 2017 improved from 2016 primarily due to manufacturing cost reductions, increases in average selling prices, and shifts in product mix, while our gross margin percentage for 2016 declined as compared to 2015 as decreases in average selling prices outpaced manufacturing cost reductions.

strong conditions in 2017 for ssd, mobile, and client storage markets drove increases in net sales as compared to 2016, particularly for ssd and mobile products. our ability to meet this demand was due in part to increases in production, primarily from the ramp of capacity and improvements in product and process technology, including our transition to 3d nand products. the increase in sales volumes of trade nand for 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to increases in demand and increases in production due to improvements in product and process technology. increases in production for 2016 were constrained in connection with transitioning to 3d nand products.
our gross margin percentage on sales of trade nand for 2017 improved from 2016 as manufacturing cost reductions outpaced declines in average selling prices, while our gross margin percentage for 2016 declined from 2015 as decreases in average selling prices outpaced manufacturing cost reductions.

operating expenses and other selling, general, and administrative sg&a expenses for 2017 were 13% higher than 2016 primarily due to increases in performance-based pay, transaction costs related to the inotera acquisition, and stock-based compensation, partially offset by a reduction in other payroll costs. sg&a expenses for 2016 were 8% lower than 2015 due to decreases in performance-based pay and travel costs and to an additional week in 2015.
research and development r&d expenses for 2017 were 13% higher than 2016 primarily due to higher volumes of product being processed that had not been qualified and increases in performance-based pay, partially offset by lower subcontracted engineering and other professional services costs. r&d expenses for 2016 were 5% higher than 2015 primarily due to higher volumes of product being processed that had not been qualified, higher payroll costs, an increase in depreciation expense from r&d capital expenditures, partially offset by an additional week in 2015.
we generally share with intel the costs of product design and process development activities for nand and 3d xpoint memory at imft and our other facilities. our r&d expenses reflect net reductions as a result of reimbursements under our cost-sharing arrangements with intel of $213 million, $205 million, and $224 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
see further discussion of our r&d in "part i - item 1. - business - research and development."
income taxes our income taxes reflect operations in tax jurisdictions, including singapore and taiwan, where our earnings are indefinitely reinvested and the tax rates are significantly lower than the u.s. statutory rate; operations outside the united states, including singapore, where we have tax incentive arrangements that further decrease our effective tax rates; and a valuation allowance against substantially all of our net deferred tax assets in the united states. income tax (provision) benefit consisted of the following:

income taxes for 2017 and 2016 included tax benefits of $28 million and $58 million, respectively, related to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters, which were previously reserved as uncertain tax positions.
we have a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax asset associated with our u.s. operations. management continues to evaluate future projected financial performance to determine whether such performance is sufficient evidence to support a reduction in or reversal of the valuation allowance. the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted if sufficient positive evidence exists.
we operate in a number of locations outside the unites states, including singapore, where we have tax incentive arrangements that are conditional, in part, upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds. the effect of tax incentive arrangements, which expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2030, reduced our tax provision by $742 million (benefiting our diluted earnings per share by $0.64) for 2017, were not material in 2016, and by $338 million ($0.29 per diluted share) for 2015.

equity in net income (loss) of equity method investees we recognize our share of earnings or losses from equity method investments generally on a two-month lag. equity in net income (loss) of equity method investees, net of tax, included the following:
for the year ended            2017            2016              2015
inotera                     $9             $32              $445

$8             $25              $447
on december 6, 2016, we ceased accounting for inotera as an equity method investment due to our acquisition of the remaining interest in inotera. our equity in net income (loss) of inotera declined for 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to the effect to inotera, under our supply agreements with them, of declines in average selling prices and inotera's cost of technology node transitions. included in our earnings for 2015 was $49 million from our equity share of inotera's full release of its valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets related to its net operating loss carryforward.
in 2017, we ceased recognizing our share of tera probe's earnings due to our sale of our equity interest in tera probe. we recorded impairment charges of $16 million, $25 million, and $10 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, within equity in net income (loss) of equity method investees to write down the carrying value of our investment in tera probe to its then fair value in each of those periods based on its trading price.
other net interest expense increased 42% for 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to increases in debt obligations, including our borrowings of 80 billion new taiwan dollars at an effective interest rate of 3.02% on december 6, 2016 in connection with our acquisition of inotera and $1.25 billion at an effective interest rate of 7.69% in april 2016 under the 2023 secured notes. net interest expense increased 18% for 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to increases in debt obligations.
further discussion of other operating and non-operating income and expenses can be found in the following notes contained in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements":
•   equity plans
•   restructure and asset impairments
•   other operating income (expense), net
•   other non-operating income (expense), net liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and financing obtained from capital markets and financial institutions. cash generated from operations is highly dependent on selling prices for our products, which can vary significantly from period to period. we are continuously evaluating alternatives for efficiently funding our capital expenditures and ongoing operations. we expect, from time to time in the future, to engage in a variety of financing transactions for such purposes, including the issuance of securities. we have a revolving credit facility that expires in february 2020 and provides for additional borrowings of up to $750 million based on eligible receivables. we expect that our cash and investments, cash flows from operations, and available financing will be sufficient to meet our requirements at least through the next 12 months.
to develop new product and process technology, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality, we must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies, facilities and equipment, and r&d. we estimate that expenditures in 2018 for property, plant, and equipment, net of partner contributions, to be in the range of $7.5 billion plus or minus 5 percent, focused on technology transitions and product enablement. the actual amounts for 2018 will vary depending on market conditions. as of august 31, 2017, we had commitments of approximately $1.1 billion for the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment, substantially all of which is expected to be paid within one year.
cash and marketable investments totaled $6.05 billion and $4.81 billion as of august 31, 2017 and september 1, 2016, respectively. our investments consist primarily of liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries
32
and individual issuers. as of august 31, 2017, $2.82 billion of our cash and marketable investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries. to mitigate credit risk, we invest through high-credit-quality financial institutions and by policy generally limit the concentration of credit exposure by restricting the amount of investments with any single obligor.
in october 2017, subsequent to the end of 2017, we issued 34 million shares of our common stock for $41.00 per share in a public offering, for net proceeds of $1.36 billion, net of underwriting fees and other offering costs. on october 12, 2017, we issued a notice to redeem $438 million of principal amount of our 2023 secured notes on november 13, 2017 for $470 million in cash, excluding accrued and unpaid interest. the amount redeemed represents 35% of the original principal amount of the 2023 secured notes issued and will be settled with proceeds from our common stock issuance in october 2017. on october 17, 2017, we issued a notice to redeem the remaining $812 million of principal amount of our 2023 secured notes on november 16, 2017 for approximately $885 million, excluding accrued and unpaid interest. additionally, on october 17, 2017, we issued a notice to redeem all of our 2023 notes on november 16, 2017 for approximately $1.05 billion in cash, excluding accrued and unpaid interest. in connection with these redemptions, we expect to recognize non-operating losses of approximately $170 million in the first quarter of 2018.
acquisition of inotera through december 6, 2016, we held a 33% ownership interest in inotera, nanya and certain of its affiliates held a 32% ownership interest, and the remaining ownership interest was publicly held. on december 6, 2016, we acquired the 67% interest in inotera for an aggregate of $4.1 billion in cash. the cash paid for the inotera acquisition was funded with 80 billion new taiwan dollars of proceeds from the 2021 mstw term loan (see "acquisition financing" below), $986 million of proceeds from the sale of 58 million shares of our common stock, and cash on hand.
acquisition financing
2021 mstw term loan: on december 6, 2016, we drew 80 billion new taiwan dollars under a collateralized, five-year term loan that bears interest at a variable per annum rate equal to the three-month or six-month taibor, at our option, plus a margin of 2.05%. principal under the 2021 mstw term loan is payable in six equal semi-annual installments, commencing in june 2019, through december 2021. the 2021 mstw term loan contains financial covenants, which if not maintained, could in certain cases constitute an event of default and result in all obligations owed under the 2021 mstw term loan being accelerated to be immediately due and payable. the 2021 mstw term loan also contains customary events of default. the 2021 mstw term loan is collateralized by certain assets and is guaranteed by micron. to hedge our currency exposure of this borrowing, we are party to a series of currency forward contracts to purchase new taiwan dollars under a rolling hedge strategy. as of august 31, 2017, the forward contracts expire at various dates through march 2018. (see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - debt.")
limitations on the use of cash and investments mmj group: cash and marketable investments included an aggregate of $580 million held by mmj as of august 31, 2017. as a result of the corporate reorganization proceedings of the mmj companies initiated in march 2012, and for so long as such proceedings are continuing, mmj is prohibited from paying dividends to us. in addition, pursuant to an order of the japan court, mmj cannot make loans or advances, other than certain ordinary course advances, to us without the consent of the japan court and may, under certain circumstances, be subject to the approval of the legal trustee. as a result, the assets of mmj are not available for use by us in our other operations. furthermore, certain uses of the assets of mmj, including investments in certain capital expenditures and in mmt, may require consent of mmj's trustees and/or the japan court.
mstw and mttw: cash and marketable investments included an aggregate of $56 million held by mstw and mttw as of august 31, 2017. the 2021 mstw term loan contains covenants that limit or restrict the ability of mstw and mttw to pay dividends. as a result, the assets of mstw and mttw are not available for use by us in our other operations.
imft: cash and marketable investments included $87 million held by imft as of august 31, 2017. our ability to access funds held by imft to finance our other operations is subject to agreement by intel and contractual limitations. amounts held by imft are not anticipated to be available to finance our other operations.
indefinitely reinvested: as of august 31, 2017, $1.29 billion of cash and marketable investments, including substantially all of the amounts held by mmj, mstw, and mttw, was held by foreign subsidiaries whose earnings were considered to be indefinitely reinvested and repatriation of these funds to the united states would be subject to u.s. federal income taxes. determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities related to investments in these foreign subsidiaries is not practicable.

(1)   amounts include mmj creditor payments, convertible notes, and other notes.
(2)   amounts include principal and interest.
(3)   amounts include contractually obligated minimum lease payments for operating leases having an initial noncancelable term in excess of one year.
(4)   purchase obligations include all commitments to purchase goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity that meet any of the following criteria: (1) they are noncancelable, (2) we would incur a penalty if the agreement was canceled, or (3) we must make specified minimum payments even if we do not take delivery of the contracted products or services. if the obligation to purchase goods or services is noncancelable, the entire value of the contract was included in the above table. if the obligation is cancelable, but we would incur a penalty if canceled, only the dollar amount of the penalty was included as a purchase obligation. contracted minimum amounts specified in any take-or-pay contracts were included in the above table as they represent the portion of each contract that is a firm commitment.
(5)   amounts represent future cash payments to satisfy other long-term liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, including $366 million for the current portion of these long-term liabilities. we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future certain payments related to uncertain tax positions and deferred tax liabilities; therefore, the amount has been excluded from the preceding table. however, other noncurrent liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet included these uncertain tax positions and deferred tax liabilities.
the expected timing of payment amounts of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information. timing and actual amounts paid may differ depending on redemptions, repurchase, or conversions of our debt, the timing of receipt of goods or services, market prices, changes to agreed-upon amounts, or timing of certain events for some obligations.
35
the contractual obligations in the table above include the current portions of the related long-term obligations. all other current liabilities are excluded.
off-balance sheet arrangements we entered into capped call transactions in connection with certain of our convertible notes and are intended to reduce the effect of potential dilution. the capped calls provide for our receipt of cash or shares, at our election, from our counterparties if the trading price of our stock is above strike prices on the expiration dates. as of august 31, 2017, the dollar value of cash or shares that we would receive from our outstanding capped calls upon their expiration dates range from $0, if the trading price of our stock is below strike prices for all of the capped calls at expiration, to $527 million, if the trading price of our stock is at or above the cap prices for all capped calls. settlement of the capped calls prior to the expiration dates may be for an amount less than the maximum value at expiration. for further details of our capped call arrangements, see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - equity - micron shareholders' equity - outstanding capped calls."
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, forecasted events, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions. we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. our management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments.
business acquisitions: accounting for acquisitions requires us to estimate the fair value of consideration paid and the individual assets and liabilities acquired, which involves a number of judgments, assumptions, and estimates that could materially affect the amount and timing of costs recognized in subsequent periods. accounting for acquisitions can also involve significant judgment to determine when control of the acquired entity is transferred. we typically obtain independent third party valuation studies to assist in determining fair values, including assistance in determining future cash flows, discount rates, and comparable market values. the items involving significant assumptions, estimates, and judgments include the following:
•   debt, including discount rate and timing of payments;
•   deferred tax assets, including projections of future taxable income and tax rates;
•   fair value of consideration paid or transferred;
•   intangible assets, including valuation methodology, estimations of future revenue and costs, profit allocation rates attributable to the acquired technology, and discount rates;
•   inventory, including estimated future selling prices, timing of product sales, and completion costs for work in process; and
•   property, plant, and equipment, including determination of values in a continued-use model.
consolidation: we have interests in entities that are vies. determining whether to consolidate a vie requires judgment in assessing whether an entity is a vie and if we are the entity's primary beneficiary. if we are the primary beneficiary of a vie, we are required to consolidate it. to determine if we are the primary beneficiary, we evaluate whether we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vie's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie. our evaluation includes identification of significant activities and an assessment of our ability to direct those activities based on governance provisions and arrangements to provide or receive product and process technology, product supply, operations services, equity funding, financing, and other applicable agreements and circumstances. our assessments of whether we are the primary beneficiary of our vies require significant assumptions and judgments.
contingencies: we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. significant judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of a loss, if any, from such contingencies. an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. we accrue a liability and charge operations for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as
36
of the balance sheet date. in accounting for the resolution of contingencies, significant judgment may be necessary to estimate amounts pertaining to periods prior to the resolution that are charged to operations in the period of resolution and amounts related to future periods.
goodwill and intangible assets: we test goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently if indicators of an impairment exist, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit with goodwill is less than its carrying value. for reporting units for which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value, goodwill is considered not impaired and we are not required to perform the goodwill impairment test. qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the fair value of the reporting unit. for reporting units for which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is below the carrying value, goodwill is tested for impairment by determining the fair value of each reporting unit and comparing it to the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit. if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered not impaired. if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then we would record an impairment loss up to the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value.
determining when to test for impairment, the reporting units, the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, and the fair value of the reporting unit requires significant judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates, forecasted manufacturing costs, and other expenses and are developed as part of our long-range planning process. the same estimates are used in business planning, forecasting, and capital budgeting as part of our long-term manufacturing capacity analysis. we test the reasonableness of the output of our long-range planning process by calculating an implied value per share and comparing that to current stock prices, analysts' consensus pricing, and management's expectations. these estimates and assumptions are used to calculate projected future cash flows for the reporting unit, which are discounted using a risk-adjusted rate to estimate a fair value. the discount rate requires determination of appropriate market comparables. we base fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. actual future results may differ from those estimates.
we test other identified intangible assets with definite useful lives when events and circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable by comparing the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. we test intangible assets with indefinite lives annually for impairment using a fair value method such as discounted cash flows. estimating fair values involves significant assumptions, including future sales prices, sales volumes, costs, and discount rates.
income taxes: we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world. these estimates involve significant judgment and interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex. resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year. we are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with u.s. gaap, which requires the assessment of our performance and other relevant factors. realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income. in recent periods, our results of operations have benefitted from increases in the amount of deferred taxes we expect to realize, primarily from the levels of capital spending and increases in the amount of taxable income we expect to realize in japan and taiwan. our income tax provision or benefit is dependent, in part, on our ability to forecast future taxable income in these and other jurisdictions. such forecasts are inherently difficult and involve significant judgments including, among others, projecting future average selling prices and sales volumes, manufacturing and overhead costs, levels of capital spending, and other factors that significantly impact our analyses of the amount of net deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized.
inventories: inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. cost includes depreciation, labor, material, and overhead costs, including product and process technology costs. determining net realizable value of inventories involves significant judgments, including projecting future average selling prices, sales volumes, and costs to complete products in work in process inventories. to project average selling prices and sales volumes, we review recent sales volumes, existing customer orders, current contract prices, industry analyses of supply and demand, seasonal factors, general economic trends, and other information. when these analyses reflect estimated net realizable values below our manufacturing costs, we record a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when inventories are actually sold. differences in forecasted average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of product inventories and accordingly the amount of write-down recorded. for example, a 5% variance in the estimated selling prices would have changed the estimated net realizable value of our inventory by approximately $439 million as of august 31, 2017. due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory and storage markets, actual selling prices and
37
volumes often vary significantly from projected prices and volumes; as a result, the timing of when product costs are charged to operations can vary significantly.
u.s. gaap provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to net realizable values. the amount of any inventory write-down can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories. in determining the lower of average cost or net realizable value, inventories are primarily categorized as memory (including dram, nand, and other memory) based on the major characteristics of product type and markets. the major characteristics we consider in determining inventory categories are product type and markets.
property, plant, and equipment: we review the carrying value of property, plant, and equipment for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and/or disposition. in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets. the estimate of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require significant judgment by us, including, but not limited to, future use of the assets for our operations versus sale or disposal of the assets, future selling prices for our products and future production and sales volumes. in addition, significant judgment is required in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performed.
we periodically assess the estimated useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. we revised the estimated useful lives of equipment in our dram wafer fabrication facilities from five to seven years in the fourth quarter of 2016. the effect of the revision was not material for 2016 and reduced depreciation costs by approximately $100 million per quarter in 2017. (see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - significant accounting policies.")
research and development: costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as r&d as incurred. determining when product development is complete requires significant judgment by us. we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability. subsequent to product qualification, product costs are included in cost of goods sold.
stock-based compensation: stock-based compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense using the straight-line amortization method over the requisite service period. for performance-based stock awards, the expense recognized is dependent on our assessment of the likelihood of the performance measure being achieved. we utilize forecasts of future performance to assess these probabilities and this assessment requires significant judgment.
determining the appropriate fair-value model and calculating the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires significant judgment, including estimating stock price volatility and expected option life. we develop these estimates based on historical data and market information which can change significantly over time. a small change in the estimates used can result in a relatively large change in the estimated valuation. we use the black-scholes option valuation model to value employee stock options. we estimate stock price volatility based on an average of historical volatility and the implied volatility derived from traded options on our stock.

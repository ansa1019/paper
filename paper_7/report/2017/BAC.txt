broad range of asset classes serving corporations, governments, institutions and individuals around the world.
2017 economic and business environment the u.s. economy gained momentum in 2017, as it grew for the eighth consecutive year. following a soft start, partly driven by sharp inventory liquidation and adverse weather effects, gdp growth accelerated over the remainder of the year. economic growth was supported by a noticeable pickup in business investment in high-tech equipment, a recovery in oil exploration and solid consumer demand growth. a revitalization in u.s. export growth, on the back of a weakening dollar and stronger global growth, also had beneficial impacts. gdp growth was limited by a mid-year softening in residential investment and a flat period for government consumption and investment. the housing market finished the year strongly. a lean supply of unsold inventory and solid demand was supportive of steady home price appreciation through much of the year.
the labor market continued to tighten as job creation exceeded the growth in the labor force. the unemployment rate fell to a 17-year low. wage growth, however, remained relatively muted.
inflation also remained low. the headline rate edged somewhat higher on recovering energy prices. but core inflation, excluding volatile food and energy components, slowed unexpectedly over much of the year, as goods' prices and health care inflation softened, and the acceleration in rents leveled off. core inflation once again finished the year below the federal reserve's two percent target level.
equity markets advanced strongly in 2017, with the s&p 500 increasing by approximately 20 percent. the anticipation of corporate tax reform and strong global earnings growth appeared to fuel the stock market's strong performance. following a mid-year decline, long-term treasury yields recovered towards the end of 2017, but finished little changed from the start of the year. with short-end rates rising over the course of the year, the yield curve flattened considerably. after a brief surge following the 2016 election, the trade-weighted dollar declined over most of 2017.
the federal open market committee (fomc) raised its target range for the federal funds rate three times in 2017, bringing the total rise in the funds rate during the current cycle to 125 basis points (bps). the federal reserve also began allowing a small portion of its treasury and mortgage-backed securities (mbs) to roll off as monetary policy normalization continued. current federal reserve baseline forecasts suggest gradual rate increases will continue into 2018 against a backdrop of solid economic expansion and a tightening labor market.
the improved economic momentum in 2017 was not confined to the u.s. the eurozone posted its strongest gdp growth in 10 years, despite heightened political uncertainty and fragmentation.
in this context, the european central bank decided to taper its quantitative easing program even if domestic inflationary pressures remained historically weak. the impact of the 2016 u.k. referendum vote in favor of leaving the european union (eu) started to materialize within the u.k. economy which, despite the robust global momentum, showed its weakest gdp growth in five years.
supported by a very accommodative monetary policy stance and sustained growth in external demand, the japanese economy expanded at the strongest pace since 2010 with headline inflation remaining positive throughout the year. across emerging nations, economic activity was supported by china's continued transition towards a more consumption-based growth model, as well as by the recovery in brazil and russia following the 2016 recession.
recent events capital management during 2017, we repurchased approximately $12.8 billion of common stock pursuant to the board's repurchase authorizations under our 2017 and 2016 comprehensive capital analysis and review (ccar) capital plans, including repurchases to offset equity-based compensation awards, and pursuant to an additional $5 billion share repurchase authorization approved by the board and the federal reserve in december 2017. for more information, see capital management on page 45.
change in tax law on december 22, 2017, the president signed into law the tax cuts and jobs act (the tax act) which made significant changes to federal income tax law including, among other things, reducing the statutory corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent and changing the taxation of our non-u.s. business activities. results for 2017 included an estimated reduction in net income of $2.9 billion due to the tax act, driven largely by a lower valuation of certain u.s. deferred tax assets and liabilities. we have accounted for the effects of the tax act using reasonable estimates based on currently available information and our interpretations thereof. this accounting may change due to, among other things, changes in interpretations we have made and the issuance of new tax or accounting guidance.
long-term debt exchange in december 2017, pursuant to a private offering, we exchanged $11.0 billion of outstanding long-term debt for new fixed/floating-rate senior notes, subject to certain terms and conditions. the impact on our results of operations related to this exchange was not significant. for more information on this exchange, see liquidity risk on page 49.

financial highlights net income was $18.2 billion, or $1.56 per diluted share in 2017 compared to $17.8 billion, or $1.49 per diluted share in 2016. the results for 2017 include an estimated charge of $2.9 billion related to the tax act. the pre-tax results for 2017 compared to 2016 were driven by higher revenue, largely the result of an increase in net interest income, lower provision for credit losses and a decline in noninterest expense.
effective october 1, 2017, we changed our accounting method for determining when certain stock-based compensation awards granted to retirement-eligible employees are deemed authorized, changing from the grant date to the beginning of the year preceding the grant date when the incentive award plans are generally approved.  as a result, the estimated value of the awards is now expensed ratably over the year preceding the grant date. all prior periods presented herein have been restated for this change in accounting method. the change affected consolidated financial information and all other; it did not affect the business segments. under the applicable bank regulatory rules, we are not required to and, accordingly, did not restate previously-filed capital metrics and ratios. the cumulative impact of the change in accounting method resulted in an insignificant pro forma change to our capital metrics and ratios. for more information, see note 1 - summary of significant accounting principles to the consolidated financial statements.

net interest income net interest income increased $3.6 billion to $44.7 billion in 2017 compared to 2016. the net interest yield increased 11 bps to 2.32 percent for 2017. these increases were primarily driven by the benefits from higher interest rates and loan and deposit growth, partially offset by the sale of the non-u.s. consumer credit card business in the second quarter of 2017. for more information regarding interest rate risk management, see interest rate risk management for the banking book on page 81.

noninterest income increased $80 million to $42.7 billion for 2017 compared to 2016. the following highlights the significant changes.
●   service charges increased $180 million primarily driven by the impact of pricing strategies and higher treasury services-related revenue.
●   investment and brokerage services income increased $536 million primarily driven by the impact of assets under management (aum) flows and higher market valuations, partially offset by the impact of changing market dynamics on transactional revenue and aum pricing.
●   investment banking income increased $770 million primarily due to higher advisory fees and higher debt and equity issuance fees.
●   trading account profits increased $375 million primarily due to increased client financing activity in equities, partially offset by weaker performance across most fixed-income products.
●   mortgage banking income decreased $1.6 billion primarily driven by lower net servicing income due to lower net mortgage servicing rights (msr) results, and lower production income primarily due to lower volume.
●   gains on sales of debt securities decreased $235 million primarily driven by lower activity.
●   other income remained relatively unchanged. included was a $793 million pre-tax gain recognized in connection with the sale of the non-u.s. consumer credit card business and a downward valuation adjustment of $946 million on tax-advantaged energy investments in connection with the tax act.
provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses decreased $201 million to $3.4 billion for 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to reductions in energy exposures in the commercial portfolio and credit quality improvements in the consumer real estate portfolio. this was partially offset by portfolio seasoning and loan growth in the u.s. credit card portfolio and a single-name non-u.s. commercial charge-off. for more information on the provision for credit losses, see provision for credit losses on page 72.

noninterest expense decreased $340 million to $54.7 billion for 2017 compared to 2016. the decrease was primarily due to lower operating costs, a reduction from the sale of the non-u.s. consumer credit card business and lower litigation expense, partially offset by a $316 million impairment charge related to certain data centers in the process of being sold and $145 million for the shared success discretionary year-end bonus awarded to certain employees.

tax expense for 2017 included a charge of $1.9 billion reflecting the impact of the tax act discussed below. included in the tax charge was $2.3 billion related primarily to a lower valuation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities and a $347 million tax benefit on the pre-tax loss from the lower valuation of our tax-advantaged energy investments. other than the impact of the tax act, the effective tax rate for 2017 was driven by our recurring tax preference benefits as well as an expense recognized in connection with the sale of the non-u.s. consumer credit card business, largely offset by benefits related to the adoption of the new accounting standard for the tax impact associated with share-based compensation and the restructuring of certain subsidiaries. the effective tax rate for 2016 was driven by our recurring tax preferences and net tax benefits related to various tax audit matters, partially offset by a charge for the impact of u.k. tax law changes enacted in 2016.

on december 22, 2017, the president signed into law the tax act which made significant changes to federal income tax law including, among other things, reducing the statutory corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent and changing the taxation of our non-u.s. business activities. results for 2017 included an estimated reduction in net income of $2.9 billion due to the tax act, driven largely by a lower valuation of certain u.s. deferred tax assets and liabilities. additionally, the change in the corporate income tax rate impacted our tax-advantaged energy investments, resulting in a downward valuation adjustment of $946 million recorded in other income that was fully offset by tax benefits arising from lower deferred tax liabilities on these investments. we have accounted for the effects of the tax act using reasonable estimates based on currently available information and our interpretations thereof. this accounting may change due to, among other things, changes in interpretations we have made and the issuance of new tax or accounting guidance.
we expect the effective tax rate for 2018 to be approximately 20 percent, absent unusual items.
our u.k. deferred tax assets, which consist primarily of net operating losses, are expected to be realized by certain subsidiaries over a number of years. significant changes to management's earnings forecasts for those subsidiaries, changes in applicable laws, further changes in tax laws or changes in the ability of our u.k. subsidiaries to conduct business in the eu, could lead management to reassess our ability to realize the u.k. deferred tax assets.

assets at december 31, 2017, total assets were approximately $2.3 trillion, up $93.2 billion from december 31, 2016. the increase in assets was primarily due to higher loans and leases driven by client demand for commercial loans, higher trading assets and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell due to increased customer activity, and higher cash and cash equivalents and debt securities driven by the deployment of deposit inflows.
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents increased $9.7 billion primarily driven by deposit growth and net debt issuances, partially offset by loan growth and net securities purchases.
federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell federal funds transactions involve lending reserve balances on a short-term basis. securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell are collateralized lending transactions utilized to accommodate customer transactions, earn interest rate spreads, and obtain securities for settlement and for collateral. federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell increased $14.5 billion due to a higher level of customer financing activity.
trading account assets trading account assets consist primarily of long positions in equity and fixed-income securities including u.s. government and agency securities, corporate securities and non-u.s. sovereign debt. trading account assets increased $29.1 billion primarily driven by additional inventory in fixed-income, currencies and commodities (ficc) to meet expected client demand and increased client financing activities in equities within global markets.
debt securities debt securities primarily include u.s. treasury and agency securities, mbs, principally agency mbs, non-u.s. bonds, corporate bonds and municipal debt. we use the debt securities portfolio primarily to manage interest rate and liquidity risk and to take advantage of market conditions that create economically attractive returns on these investments. debt securities increased $9.4 billion primarily driven by the deployment of deposit inflows. for more information on debt securities, see note 3 - securities to the consolidated financial statements.
loans and leases loans and leases increased $30.1 billion compared to december 31, 2016. the increase was primarily due to net loan growth driven by strong client demand for commercial loans and increases in

liabilities at december 31, 2017, total liabilities were approximately $2.0 trillion, up $92.2 billion from december 31, 2016, primarily due to an increase in deposits, higher trading account liabilities due to an increase in short positions, and higher long-term debt due to net issuances.
deposits deposits increased $48.6 billion primarily due to an increase in retail deposits.
federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase federal funds transactions involve borrowing reserve balances on a short-term basis. securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase are collateralized borrowing transactions utilized to accommodate customer transactions, earn interest rate spreads and finance assets on the balance sheet. federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase increased $6.6 billion primarily due to an increase in repurchase agreements.
trading account liabilities trading account liabilities consist primarily of short positions in equity and fixed-income securities including u.s. treasury and agency securities, corporate securities and non-u.s. sovereign debt. trading account liabilities increased $18.2 billion primarily due to higher equity short positions and higher levels of short government bonds driven by expected client demand within global markets.
short-term borrowings short-term borrowings provide an additional funding source and primarily consist of federal home loan bank (fhlb) short-term borrowings, notes payable and various other borrowings that generally have maturities of one year or less. short-term borrowings increased $8.7 billion primarily due to an increase in short-term bank notes and short-term fhlb advances. for more information on short-term borrowings, see note 10 - federal funds sold or purchased, securities financing agreements and short-term borrowings to the consolidated financial statements.

supplemental financial data in this form 10-k, we present certain non-gaap financial measures. non-gaap financial measures exclude certain items or otherwise include components that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with gaap. non-gaap financial measures are provided as additional useful information to assess our financial condition, results of operations (including period-to-period operating performance) or compliance with prospective regulatory requirements. these non-gaap financial measures are not intended as a substitute for gaap financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as non-gaap financial measures used by other companies.
we view net interest income and related ratios and analyses on a fully taxable-equivalent (fte) basis, which when presented on a consolidated basis, are non-gaap financial measures. to derive the fte basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. for purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent and a representative state tax rate. in addition, certain performance measures including the efficiency ratio and net interest yield utilize net interest income (and thus total revenue) on an fte basis. the efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue, and net interest yield measures the bps we earn over the cost of funds. we believe that presentation of these items on an fte basis allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices.
we may present certain key performance indicators and ratios excluding certain items (e.g., debit valuation adjustment (dva)) which result in non-gaap financial measures. we believe that the presentation of measures that exclude these items are useful because they provide additional information to assess the underlying operational performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance.
we also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-gaap financial measure. tangible equity represents an adjusted shareholders' equity or common shareholders' equity amount which has been reduced by goodwill and certain acquired intangible assets (excluding msrs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. these measures are used to evaluate our use of equity. in addition, profitability, relationship and investment models use both return on average tangible common shareholders' equity and return on average tangible shareholders' equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals. these ratios are as follows:
●   return on average tangible common shareholders' equity measures our earnings contribution as a percentage of adjusted common shareholders' equity. the tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders' equity divided by total assets less goodwill and certain acquired intangible assets (excluding msrs), net of related deferred tax liabilities.
●   return on average tangible shareholders' equity measures our earnings contribution as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders' equity. the tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders' equity divided by total assets less goodwill and certain acquired intangible assets (excluding msrs), net of related deferred tax liabilities.
●   tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders' equity divided by ending common shares outstanding.
we believe that the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. tangible book value per share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of common stock.
the aforementioned supplemental data and performance measures are presented in tables 7 and 8.

business segment operations segment description and basis of presentation we report our results of operations through the following four business segments: consumer banking, gwim, global banking and global markets, with the remaining operations recorded in all other. the primary activities, products and businesses of the business segments and all other are shown below.
we periodically review capital allocated to our businesses and allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. we utilize a methodology that considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to internal risk-based capital models. our internal risk-based capital models use a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment's credit, market, interest rate, business and operational risk components. for more information on the nature of these risks, see managing risk on page 41. the capital allocated to the business segments is referred to as allocated capital. allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit. for more information, see note 8 - goodwill and intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements.
for more information on the basis of presentation for business segments and reconciliations to consolidated total revenue, net income and year-end total assets, see note 23 - business segment information to the consolidated financial statements.

mortgage banking income mortgage banking income in consumer banking includes production income and net servicing income. production income is comprised primarily of revenue from the fair value gains and losses recognized on our interest rate lock commitments (irlcs) and loans held-for-sale (lhfs), the related secondary market execution, and costs related to representations and warranties made in the sales transactions along with other obligations incurred in the sales of mortgage loans. production income decreased $461 million to $202 million in 2017 due to a decision to retain a higher percentage of residential mortgage production in consumer banking, as well as the impact of a higher interest rate environment driving lower refinances.
net servicing income within consumer banking includes income earned in connection with servicing activities and msr valuation adjustments for the core portfolio, net of results from risk management activities used to hedge certain market risks of the msrs. net servicing income decreased $18 million to $279 million in 2017 reflecting the decline in the size of the servicing portfolio.
mortgage servicing rights at december 31, 2017, the core msr portfolio, held within consumer lending, was $1.7 billion compared to $2.1 billion at december 31, 2016. the decrease was primarily driven by the amortization of expected cash flows, which exceeded additions to the msr portfolio, partially offset by the impact of changes in fair value from rising interest rates. for more information on msrs, see note 20 - fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements.

gwim consists of two primary businesses: merrill lynch global wealth management (mlgwm) and u.s. trust, bank of america private wealth management (u.s. trust).
mlgwm's advisory business provides a high-touch client experience through a network of financial advisors focused on clients with over $250,000 in total investable assets. mlgwm provides tailored solutions to meet our clients' needs through a full set of investment management, brokerage, banking and retirement products.
u.s. trust, together with mlgwm's private banking & investments group, provides comprehensive wealth management solutions targeted to high net worth and ultra high net worth clients, as well as customized solutions to meet clients' wealth structuring, investment management, trust and banking needs, including specialty asset management services.
net income for gwim increased $313 million to $3.1 billion in 2017 compared to 2016 due to higher revenue, partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense. the operating margin was 27 percent compared to 25 percent a year ago.
net interest income increased $414 million to $6.2 billion driven by higher short-term interest rates. noninterest income, which primarily includes investment and brokerage services income, increased $526 million to $12.4 billion. the increase in noninterest income was driven by the impact of aum flows and higher market valuations, partially offset by the impact of changing market dynamics on transactional revenue and aum pricing. noninterest expense increased $389 million to $13.6 billion primarily driven by higher revenue-related incentive costs.
return on average allocated capital was 22 percent in 2017, up from 21 percent a year ago, as higher net income was partially offset by an increased capital allocation.
revenue from mlgwm of $15.3 billion increased six percent in 2017 compared to 2016 due to higher net interest income and asset management fees driven by aum flows and higher market valuations, partially offset by lower transactional revenue and aum pricing. u.s. trust revenue of $3.3 billion increased seven percent in 2017 compared to 2016 reflecting higher net interest income and asset management fees driven by higher market valuations and aum flows.

client balances increased $243.3 billion, or 10 percent, in 2017 to nearly $2.8 trillion at december 31, 2017, primarily due to aum which increased $194.6 billion, or 22 percent, due to positive net flows and higher market valuations.

term rates on an increased deposit base and the impact of the allocation of alm activities, partially offset by credit spread compression. noninterest income increased $521 million to $9.5 billion largely due to higher investment banking fees.
the provision for credit losses decreased $671 million to $212 million in 2017 primarily driven by reductions in energy exposures and continued portfolio improvement, partially offset by global banking's portion of a single-name non-u.s. commercial charge-off. noninterest expense increased $110 million to $8.6 billion in 2017 primarily driven by higher investments in technology and higher deposit insurance, partially offset by lower litigation costs.
the return on average allocated capital was 17 percent, up from 15 percent, as higher net income was partially offset by an increased capital allocation. for more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see business segment operations on page 30.

business lending revenue increased $271 million in 2017 compared to 2016 driven by the impact of loan and lease-related growth and the allocation of alm activities, partially offset by credit spread compression.
global transaction services revenue increased $734 million in 2017 compared to 2016 driven by the impact of higher short-term rates on an increased deposit base, as well as the allocation of alm activities.
average loans and leases increased four percent in 2017 compared to 2016 driven by growth in the commercial and industrial, and leasing portfolios. average deposits increased three percent due to growth with new and existing clients.
global investment banking client teams and product specialists underwrite and distribute debt, equity and loan products, and provide advisory services and tailored risk management solutions. the economics of certain investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between global banking and global markets under an internal revenue-sharing arrangement. to provide a complete discussion of our consolidated investment banking fees, the following table presents total corporation investment banking fees and the portion attributable to global banking.

net income for global markets decreased $525 million to $3.3 billion in 2017 compared to 2016. net dva losses were $428 million compared to losses of $238 million in 2016. excluding net dva, net income decreased $408 million to $3.6 billion primarily driven by higher noninterest expense, lower sales and trading revenue and an increase in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher investment banking fees.
sales and trading revenue, excluding net dva, decreased $423 million primarily due to weaker performance in rates products and emerging markets. the provision for credit losses increased $133 million to $164 million, reflecting global markets' portion of a single-name non-u.s. commercial charge-off. noninterest expense increased $562 million to $10.7 billion primarily due to higher litigation expense and continued investments in technology.

trading-related assets increased $38.8 billion to $419.4 billion at december 31, 2017 driven by additional inventory in ficc to meet expected client demand as well as targeted growth in client financing activities in the global equities business.
the return on average allocated capital decreased to nine percent, reflecting lower net income, partially offset by a decrease in average allocated capital.
sales and trading revenue sales and trading revenue includes unrealized and realized gains and losses on trading and other assets, net interest income, and fees primarily from commissions on equity securities. sales and trading revenue is segregated into fixed-income (government debt obligations, investment and non-investment grade corporate debt obligations, commercial mbs, residential mortgage-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations, interest rate and credit derivative contracts), currencies (interest rate and foreign exchange contracts), commodities (primarily futures, forwards, swaps and options) and equities (equity-linked derivatives and cash equity activity). the following table and related discussion present sales and trading revenue, substantially all of which is in global markets, with the remainder in global banking. in addition, the following table and related discussion present sales and trading revenue excluding the impact of net dva, which is a non-gaap financial measure. we believe the use of this non-gaap financial measure provides additional useful information to assess the underlying performance of these businesses and to allow better comparison of year-over-year operating performance.

(2)   includes global banking sales and trading revenue of $236 million and $406 million for 2017 and 2016.
(3)   ficc and equities sales and trading revenue, excluding net dva, is a non-gaap financial measure. ficc net dva losses were $394 million and $238 million for 2017 and 2016. equities net dva losses were $34 million and $0 for 2017 and 2016.
the following explanations for year-over-year changes in sales and trading, ficc and equities revenue, would be the same if net dva was included. ficc revenue, excluding net dva, decreased $552 million from 2016 primarily due to lower revenue in rates products and emerging markets as lower volatility led to reduced client flow. the decline in ficc revenue was also impacted by higher funding costs which were driven by increases in market interest rates. equities revenue, excluding net dva, increased $129 million from 2016 due to higher revenue from the growth in client financing activities which was partially offset by lower revenue in cash and derivative trading due to lower levels of volatility and client activity.

all other consists of alm activities, equity investments, non-core mortgage loans and servicing activities, the net impact of periodic revisions to the msr valuation model for both core and non-core msrs and the related economic hedge results and ineffectiveness, liquidating businesses, and residual expense allocations. alm activities encompass certain residential mortgages, debt securities, interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities, the impact of certain allocation methodologies and accounting hedge ineffectiveness. the results of certain alm activities are allocated to our business segments. for more information on our alm activities, see note 23 - business segment information to the consolidated financial statements. equity investments include our merchant services joint venture as well as global principal investments which is comprised of a portfolio of equity, real estate and other alternative investments. for more information on our merchant services joint venture, see note 12 - commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements. income tax is generally recorded in the business segments at the statutory rate; the initial impact of the tax act was recorded in all other.
in 2017, the corporation sold its non-u.s. consumer credit card business. for more information on the sale, see note 1 - summary of significant accounting principles to the consolidated financial statements.
the corporation classifies consumer real estate loans as core or non-core based on loan and customer characteristics such as origination date, product type, ltv, fico score and delinquency status. for more information on the core and non-core portfolios, see consumer portfolio credit risk management on page 54. residential mortgage loans that are held for alm purposes, including interest rate or liquidity risk management, are classified as core and are presented on the balance sheet of all other. for more information on our interest rate and liquidity risk management activities, see liquidity risk on page 49 and interest rate risk management for the banking book on page 81. during 2017, residential mortgage loans held for alm activities decreased $6.1 billion to $28.5 billion at december 31, 2017 primarily as a result of payoffs and paydowns outpacing new originations. non-core residential mortgage and home equity loans, which are principally run-off portfolios, including certain loans accounted for under the fair value option and msrs pertaining to non-core loans serviced for others, are also held in all other. during 2017, total non-core loans decreased $11.8 billion to $41.3 billion at december 31, 2017 due primarily to payoffs and paydowns, as well as loan sales.
the net loss for all other increased $1.6 billion to a net loss of $3.3 billion, driven by an estimated charge of $2.9 billion due to enactment of the tax act. for more information, see financial highlights on page 21. the pre-tax loss for 2017 compared to 2016 decreased $526 million reflecting lower noninterest expense and a larger benefit in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by a decline in revenue.
revenue declined $1.5 billion primarily due to lower mortgage banking income. mortgage banking income declined $1.2 billion primarily due to less favorable valuations on msrs, net of related hedges, and an increase in the provision for representations and warranties. all other noninterest loss decreased marginally and included a pre-tax gain of $793 million on the sale of the non-
u.s. credit card business and a downward valuation adjustment of $946 million on tax-advantaged energy investments in connection with the tax act. gains on sales of loans included in all other loss, including nonperforming and other delinquent loans, were $134 million compared to gains of $232 million in the same period in 2016.
the benefit in the provision for credit losses increased $461 million to a benefit of $561 million primarily driven by continued runoff of the non-core portfolio, loan sale recoveries and the sale of the non-u.s. consumer credit card business.
noninterest expense decreased $1.5 billion to $4.1 billion driven by lower litigation expense, lower personnel expense and a decline in non-core mortgage servicing costs, partially offset by a $316 million impairment charge related to certain data centers in the process of being sold.
the income tax benefit was $1.0 billion in 2017 compared to a benefit of $3.1 billion in 2016. the decrease in the tax benefit was driven by the impacts of the tax act, including an estimated income tax expense of $1.9 billion related primarily to a lower valuation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities. both periods include income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the fte treatment of certain tax credits recorded in global banking.
off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we have contractual obligations to make future payments on debt and lease agreements. additionally, in the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements whereby we commit to future purchases of products or services from unaffiliated parties. purchase obligations are defined as obligations that are legally binding agreements whereby we agree to purchase products or services with a specific minimum quantity at a fixed, minimum or variable price over a specified period of time. included in purchase obligations are vendor contracts, the most significant of which include communication services, processing services and software contracts. debt, lease and other obligations are more fully discussed in note 11 - long-term debt and note 12 - commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements.
other long-term liabilities include our contractual funding obligations related to the qualified pension plan, non-u.s. pension plans, nonqualified and other pension plans, and postretirement health and life plans (collectively, the plans). obligations to the plans are based on the current and projected obligations of the plans, performance of the plans' assets, and any participant contributions, if applicable. during 2017 and 2016, we contributed $514 million and $256 million to the plans, and we expect to make $128 million of contributions during 2018. the plans are more fully discussed in note 17 - employee benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements.
we enter into commitments to extend credit such as loan commitments, standby letters of credit (sblcs) and commercial letters of credit to meet the financing needs of our customers. for a summary of the total unfunded, or off-balance sheet, credit extension commitment amounts by expiration date, see credit extension commitments in note 12 - commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements.

representations and warranties for background information on representations and warranties, see note 7 - representations and warranties obligations and corporate guarantees to the consolidated financial statements. breaches of representations and warranties made in connection with the sale of mortgage loans have resulted in and may continue to result in the requirement to repurchase mortgage loans or to otherwise make whole or provide other remedies to investors, securitization trusts, guarantors, insurers or other parties (collectively, repurchases).
at december 31, 2017 and 2016, we had $17.6 billion and $18.3 billion of unresolved repurchase claims, predominately related to subprime and pay option first-lien loans and home equity loans originated primarily between 2004 and 2008.
in addition to unresolved repurchase claims, we have received notifications indicating that we may have indemnity obligations with respect to specific loans for which we have not received a repurchase request. these notifications were received prior to 2015, and totaled $1.3 billion at both december 31, 2017 and 2016. during 2017, we reached agreements with certain parties requesting indemnity. one such agreement is subject to acceptance by a securitization trustee. the impact of these agreements is included in the provision and reserve for representations and warranties.
the reserve for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and the related provision is included in mortgage banking income. at december 31, 2017 and 2016, the reserve for representations and warranties was $1.9 billion and $2.3 billion. the representations and warranties provision was $393 million for 2017 compared to $106 million for 2016 with the increase resulting from settlements or advanced negotiations with certain counterparties where we believe we will reach settlements on several outstanding legacy matters.
in addition, we currently estimate that the range of possible loss for representations and warranties exposures could be up to $1 billion over existing accruals at december 31, 2017. this estimate is lower than the estimate at december 31, 2016 due to recent reductions in risk as we reach settlements with counterparties. the estimated range of possible loss represents a reasonably possible loss, but does not represent a probable loss, and is based on currently available information, significant judgment and a number of assumptions that are subject to change.
future provisions and/or ranges of possible loss associated with obligations under representations and warranties may be significantly impacted if future experiences are different from historical experience or our understandings, interpretations or assumptions. adverse developments with respect to one or more of the assumptions underlying the reserve for representations and warranties and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss, such as counterparties successfully challenging or avoiding the application of the relevant statute of limitations, could result in significant increases to future provisions and/or the estimated range of possible loss. for more information on representations and warranties, see note 7 - representations and warranties obligations and corporate guarantees to the consolidated financial statements and, for more information related to the sensitivity of the assumptions used to estimate our liability for representations and warranties, see complex accounting estimates - representations and warranties liability on page 86.
other mortgage-related matters we continue to be subject to mortgage-related litigation and disputes, as well as governmental and regulatory scrutiny and investigations, related to our past and current origination, servicing, transfer of servicing and servicing rights, servicing compliance obligations, foreclosure activities, indemnification obligations, and mortgage insurance and captive reinsurance practices with mortgage insurers. the ongoing environment of regulatory scrutiny, heightened regulatory compliance obligations, and enhanced regulatory enforcement, combined with ongoing uncertainty related to the continuing evolution of the regulatory environment, has resulted in increased operational and compliance costs and may limit our ability to continue providing certain products and services. for more information on management's estimate of the aggregate range of possible loss for certain litigation matters and on regulatory investigations, see note 12 - commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements.

managing risk overview risk is inherent in all our business activities. sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders. if not managed well, risks can result in financial loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and damage to our reputation, each of which may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategies. we take a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined risk framework and an articulated risk appetite statement which are approved annually by the enterprise risk committee (erc) and the board.
the seven key types of risk faced by the corporation are strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks.
●   strategic risk is the risk resulting from incorrect assumptions about external or internal factors, inappropriate business plans, ineffective business strategy execution, or failure to respond in a timely manner to changes in the regulatory, macroeconomic or competitive environments in the geographic locations in which we operate.
●   credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability or failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its obligations.
●   market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions may adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities, or otherwise negatively impact earnings.
●   liquidity risk is the inability to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral needs while continuing to support our businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions.
●   compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or damage to the reputation of the corporation arising from the failure of the corporation to comply with the requirements of applicable laws, rules, regulations and related self-regulatory organizations' standards and codes of conduct.
●   operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events.
●   reputational risk is the risk that negative perceptions of the corporation's conduct or business practices may adversely impact its profitability or operations.
the following sections address in more detail the specific procedures, measures and analyses of the major categories of risk. this discussion of managing risk focuses on the current risk framework that, as part of its annual review process, was approved by the erc and the board.
as set forth in our risk framework, a culture of managing risk well is fundamental to our values and operating principles. it requires us to focus on risk in all activities and encourages the necessary mindset and behavior to enable effective risk management, and promotes sound risk-taking within our risk appetite. sustaining a culture of managing risk well throughout the organization is critical to our success and is a clear expectation of our executive management team and the board.
our risk framework serves as the foundation for the consistent and effective management of risks facing the corporation. the risk framework sets forth clear roles, responsibilities and accountability for the management of risk and provides a blueprint for how the board, through delegation of authority to committees and executive officers, establishes risk appetite and associated limits for our activities.
executive management assesses, with board oversight, the risk-adjusted returns of each business. management reviews and approves the strategic and financial operating plans, as well as the capital plan and risk appetite statement, and recommends them annually to the board for approval. our strategic plan takes into consideration return objectives and financial resources, which must align with risk capacity and risk appetite. management sets financial objectives for each business by allocating capital and setting a target for return on capital for each business. capital allocations and operating limits are regularly evaluated as part of our overall governance processes as the businesses and the economic environment in which we operate continue to evolve. for more information regarding capital allocations, see business segment operations on page 30.
the corporation's risk appetite indicates the amount of capital, earnings or liquidity we are willing to put at risk to achieve our strategic objectives and business plans, consistent with applicable regulatory requirements. our risk appetite provides a common and comparable set of measures for senior management and the board to clearly indicate our aggregate level of risk and to monitor whether the corporation's risk profile remains in alignment with our strategic and capital plans. our risk appetite is formally articulated in the risk appetite statement, which includes both qualitative components and quantitative limits.
for a more detailed discussion of our risk management activities, see the discussion below and pages 44 through 84.
our overall capacity to take risk is limited; therefore, we prioritize the risks we take in order to maintain a strong and flexible financial position so we can withstand challenging economic conditions and take advantage of organic growth opportunities. therefore, we set objectives and targets for capital and liquidity that are intended to permit us to continue to operate in a safe and sound manner, including during periods of stress.
our lines of business operate with risk limits (which may include credit, market and/or operational limits, as applicable) that are based on the amount of capital, earnings or liquidity we are willing to put at risk to achieve our strategic objectives and business plans. executive management is responsible for tracking and reporting performance measurements as well as any exceptions to guidelines or limits. the board, and its committees when appropriate, oversees financial performance, execution of the strategic and financial operating plans, adherence to risk appetite limits and the adequacy of internal controls.
risk management governance the risk framework describes delegations of authority whereby the board and its committees may delegate authority to management-level committees or executive officers. such delegations may authorize certain decision-making and approval functions, which may be evidenced in, for example, committee charters, job descriptions, meeting minutes and resolutions.

the chart below illustrates the inter-relationship among the board, board committees and management committees that have the majority of risk oversight responsibilities for the corporation.
(1) this presentation does not include committees for other legal entities.
(2) reports to the ceo and cfo with oversight by the audit committee.
board of directors and board committees the board is comprised of 15 directors, all but one of whom are independent. the board authorizes management to maintain an effective risk framework, and oversees compliance with safe and sound banking practices. in addition, the board or its committees conduct inquiries of, and receive reports from management on risk-related matters to assess scope or resource limitations that could impede the ability of independent risk management (irm) and/or corporate audit to execute its responsibilities. the board committees discussed below have the principal responsibility for enterprise-wide oversight of our risk management activities. through these activities, the board and applicable committees are provided with information on our risk profile, and oversee executive management addressing key risks we face. other board committees as described below provide additional oversight of specific risks.
each of the committees shown on the above chart regularly reports to the board on risk-related matters within the committee's responsibilities, which is intended to collectively provide the board with integrated insight about our management of enterprise-wide risks.
audit committee the audit committee oversees the qualifications, performance and independence of the independent registered public accounting firm, the performance of our corporate audit function, the integrity of our consolidated financial statements, our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and makes inquiries of management or the corporate general auditor (cga) to determine whether there are scope or resource limitations that impede the ability of corporate audit to execute its responsibilities. the audit committee is also responsible for overseeing compliance risk pursuant to the new york stock exchange listing standards.
enterprise risk committee the erc has primary responsibility for oversight of the risk framework and key risks we face. it approves the risk framework and the risk appetite statement and further recommends these documents to the board for approval. the erc oversees senior management's responsibilities for the identification, measurement, monitoring and control of key risks we face. the erc may consult with other board committees on risk-related matters.
other board committees our corporate governance committee oversees our board's governance processes, identifies and reviews the qualifications of potential board members, recommends nominees for election to our board, recommends committee appointments for board approval and reviews our environmental, social and government (esg) and stockholder engagement activities.
our compensation and benefits committee oversees establishing, maintaining and administering our compensation programs and employee benefit plans, including approving and recommending our chief executive officer's (ceo) compensation to our board for further approval by all independent directors, and reviewing and approving all of our executive officers' compensation, as well as compensation for non-management directors.
management committees management committees may receive their authority from the board, a board committee, another management committee or from one or more executive officers. our primary management-level risk committee is the management risk committee (mrc). subject to board oversight, the mrc is responsible for management oversight of key risks facing the corporation. the mrc provides management oversight of our compliance and operational risk programs, balance sheet and capital management, funding activities and other liquidity activities, stress testing, trading activities, recovery and resolution planning, model risk, subsidiary governance, and activities between member banks and their nonbank affiliates pursuant to federal reserve rules and regulations, among other things.

lines of defense we have clear ownership and accountability across three lines of defense: front line units (flus), irm and corporate audit. we also have control functions outside of flus and irm (e.g., legal and global human resources). the three lines of defense are integrated into our management-level governance structure. each of these functional roles is described in more detail below.
executive officers executive officers lead various functions representing the functional roles. authority for functional roles may be delegated to executive officers from the board, board committees or management-level committees. executive officers, in turn, may further delegate responsibilities, as appropriate, to management-level committees, management routines or individuals. executive officers review our activities for consistency with our risk framework, risk appetite statement and applicable strategic, capital and financial operating plans, as well as applicable policies, standards, procedures and processes. executive officers and other employees make decisions individually on a day-to-day basis, consistent with the authority they have been delegated. executive officers and other employees may also serve on committees and participate in committee decisions.
front line units flus include the lines of business as well as the global technology and operations group, and are responsible for appropriately assessing and effectively managing all of the risks associated with their activities.
three organizational units that include flu activities and control function activities, but are not part of irm are the chief financial officer (cfo) group, global marketing and corporate affairs (gm&ca) and the chief administrative officer (cao) group.
independent risk management irm is part of our control functions and includes global risk management and global compliance. we have other control functions that are not part of irm (other control functions may also provide oversight to flu activities), including legal, global human resources and certain activities within the cao group, cfo group and gm&ca. irm, led by the chief risk officer (cro), is responsible for independently assessing and overseeing risks within flus and other control functions. irm establishes written enterprise policies and procedures that include concentration risk limits, where appropriate. such policies and procedures outline how aggregate risks are identified, measured, monitored and controlled.
the cro has the stature, authority and independence to develop and implement a meaningful risk management framework. the cro has unrestricted access to the board and reports directly to both the erc and to the ceo. global risk management is organized into horizontal risk teams, flu risk teams and control function risk teams that work collaboratively in executing their respective duties.
within irm, global compliance independently assesses compliance risk, and evaluates adherence to applicable laws, rules and regulations, including identifying compliance issues and risks, performing monitoring and testing, and reporting on the state of compliance activities across the corporation. additionally, global compliance works with flus and control functions so that day-to-day activities operate in a compliant manner.
corporate audit corporate audit and the cga maintain their independence from the flus, irm and other control functions by reporting directly to the audit committee or the board. the cga administratively reports to the ceo. corporate audit provides independent assessment and validation through testing of key processes and controls across the corporation. corporate audit includes credit review which periodically tests and examines credit portfolios and processes.
risk management processes the risk framework requires that strong risk management practices are integrated in key strategic, capital and financial planning processes and in day-to-day business processes across the corporation, with a goal of ensuring risks are appropriately considered, evaluated and responded to in a timely manner.
we employ a risk management process, referred to as identify, measure, monitor and control, as part of our daily activities.
identify - to be effectively managed, risks must be clearly defined and proactively identified. proper risk identification focuses on recognizing and understanding key risks inherent in our business activities or key risks that may arise from external factors. each employee is expected to identify and escalate risks promptly. risk identification is an ongoing process, incorporating input from flus and control functions, designed to be forward looking and capture relevant risk factors across all of our lines of business.
measure - once a risk is identified, it must be prioritized and accurately measured through a systematic risk quantification process including quantitative and qualitative components. risk is measured at various levels including, but not limited to, risk type, flu, legal entity and on an aggregate basis. this risk quantification process helps to capture changes in our risk profile due to changes in strategic direction, concentrations, portfolio quality and the overall economic environment. senior management considers how risk exposures might evolve under a variety of stress scenarios.
monitor - we monitor risk levels regularly to track adherence to risk appetite, policies, standards, procedures and processes. we also regularly update risk assessments and review risk exposures. through our monitoring, we can determine our level of risk relative to limits and can take action in a timely manner. we also can determine when risk limits are breached and have processes to appropriately report and escalate exceptions. this includes requests for approval to managers and alerts to executive management, management-level committees or the board (directly or through an appropriate committee).
control - we establish and communicate risk limits and controls through policies, standards, procedures and processes that define the responsibilities and authority for risk-taking. the limits and controls can be adjusted by the board or management when conditions or risk tolerances warrant. these limits may be absolute (e.g., loan amount, trading volume) or relative (e.g., percentage of loan book in higher-risk categories). our lines of business are held accountable to perform within the established limits.

the formal processes used to manage risk represent a part of our overall risk management process. we instill a strong and comprehensive culture of managing risk well through communications, training, policies, procedures and organizational roles and responsibilities. establishing a culture reflective of our purpose to help make our customers' financial lives better and delivering our responsible growth strategy are also critical to effective risk management. we understand that improper actions, behaviors or practices that are illegal, unethical or contrary to our core values could result in harm to the corporation, our shareholders or our customers, damage the integrity of the financial markets, or negatively impact our reputation, and have established protocols and structures so that such conduct risk is governed and reported across the corporation. specifically, our code of conduct provides a framework for all of our employees to conduct themselves with the highest integrity. additionally, we continue to strengthen the link between the employee performance management process and individual compensation to encourage employees to work toward enterprise-wide risk goals.
corporation-wide stress testing integral to our capital planning, financial planning and strategic planning processes, we conduct capital scenario management and stress forecasting on a periodic basis to better understand balance sheet, earnings and capital sensitivities to certain economic and business scenarios, including economic and market conditions that are more severe than anticipated. these stress forecasts provide an understanding of the potential impacts from our risk profile on the balance sheet, earnings and capital, and serve as a key component of our capital and risk management practices. the intent of stress testing is to develop a comprehensive understanding of potential impacts of on- and off-balance sheet risks at the corporation and how they impact financial resiliency, which provides confidence to management, regulators and our investors.
contingency planning we have developed and maintain contingency plans that are designed to prepare us in advance to respond in the event of potential adverse economic, financial or market stress. these contingency plans include our capital contingency plan, contingency funding plan and recovery plan, which provide monitoring, escalation, actions and routines designed to enable us to increase capital, access funding sources and reduce risk through consideration of potential options that include asset sales, business sales, capital or debt issuances, or other de-risking strategies. we also maintain a resolution plan to limit adverse systemic impacts that could be associated with a potential resolution of bank of america.
strategic risk management strategic risk is embedded in every business and is one of the major risk categories along with credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. this risk results from incorrect assumptions about external or internal factors, inappropriate business plans, ineffective business strategy execution, or failure to respond in a timely manner to changes in the regulatory, macroeconomic or competitive environments, in the geographic locations in which we operate, such as competitor actions, changing customer preferences, product obsolescence and technology developments. our strategic plan is consistent with our risk appetite, capital plan and liquidity requirements, and specifically addresses strategic risks.
on an annual basis, the board reviews and approves the strategic plan, capital plan, financial operating plan and risk appetite statement. with oversight by the board, executive management directs the lines of business to execute our strategic plan consistent with our core operating principles and risk appetite. the executive management team monitors business performance throughout the year and provides the board with regular progress reports on whether strategic objectives and timelines are being met, including reports on strategic risks and if additional or alternative actions need to be considered or implemented. the regular executive reviews focus on assessing forecasted earnings and returns on capital, the current risk profile, current capital and liquidity requirements, staffing levels and changes required to support the strategic plan, stress testing results, and other qualitative factors such as market growth rates and peer analysis.
significant strategic actions, such as capital actions, material acquisitions or divestitures, and resolution plans are reviewed and approved by the board. at the business level, processes are in place to discuss the strategic risk implications of new, expanded or modified businesses, products or services and other strategic initiatives, and to provide formal review and approval where required. with oversight by the board and the erc, executive management performs similar analyses throughout the year, and evaluates changes to the financial forecast or the risk, capital or liquidity positions as deemed appropriate to balance and optimize achieving the targeted risk appetite, shareholder returns and maintaining the targeted financial strength. proprietary models are used to measure the capital requirements for credit, country, market, operational and strategic risks. the allocated capital assigned to each business is based on its unique risk profile. with oversight by the board, executive management assesses the risk-adjusted returns of each business in approving strategic and financial operating plans. the businesses use allocated capital to define business strategies, and price products and transactions.

capital management the corporation manages its capital position so its capital is more than adequate to support its business activities and to maintain capital, risk and risk appetite commensurate with one another. additionally, we seek to maintain safety and soundness at all times, even under adverse scenarios, take advantage of organic growth opportunities, meet obligations to creditors and counterparties, maintain ready access to financial markets, continue to serve as a credit intermediary, remain a source of strength for our subsidiaries, and satisfy current and future regulatory capital requirements. capital management is integrated into our risk and governance processes, as capital is a key consideration in the development of our strategic plan, risk appetite and risk limits.
we conduct an internal capital adequacy assessment process (icaap) on a periodic basis. the icaap is a forward-looking assessment of our projected capital needs and resources, incorporating earnings, balance sheet and risk forecasts under baseline and adverse economic and market conditions. we utilize periodic stress tests to assess the potential impacts to our balance sheet, earnings, regulatory capital and liquidity under a variety of stress scenarios. we perform qualitative risk assessments to identify and assess material risks not fully captured in our forecasts or stress tests. we assess the potential capital impacts of proposed changes to regulatory capital requirements. management assesses icaap results and provides documented quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our capital guidelines and capital position to the board or its committees.
we periodically review capital allocated to our businesses and allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. for more information, see business segment operations on page 30.
ccar and capital planning the federal reserve requires bhcs to submit a capital plan and requests for capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing the ccar capital plan.
on june 28, 2017, following the federal reserve's non-objection to our 2017 ccar capital plan, the board authorized the repurchase of $12.0 billion in common stock from july 1, 2017 through june 30, 2018, plus repurchases expected to be approximately $900 million to offset the effect of equity-based compensation plans during the same period. on december 5, 2017, following approval by the federal reserve, the board authorized the repurchase of an additional $5.0 billion of common stock through june 30, 2018. the common stock repurchase authorizations include both common stock and warrants. during 2017, pursuant to the board's authorizations, including those related to our 2016 ccar capital plan that expired june 30, 2017, we repurchased $12.8 billion of common stock, which includes common stock repurchases to offset equity-based compensation awards. at december 31, 2017, our remaining stock repurchase authorization was $10.1 billion.
the timing and amount of common stock repurchases will be subject to various factors, including the corporation's capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price, and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time. the common stock repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including repurchase plans that satisfy the conditions of rule 10b5-1 of the securities exchange act of 1934. as a "well-capitalized" bhc, we may notify the federal reserve of our intention to make additional capital distributions not to exceed 0.25 percent of tier 1 capital, and which were not contemplated in our capital plan, subject to the federal reserve's non-objection.
regulatory capital as a financial services holding company, we are subject to regulatory capital rules issued by u.s. banking regulators including basel 3, which includes certain transition provisions through january 1, 2019. the corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, bana, are basel 3 advanced approaches institutions.
basel 3 overview basel 3 updated the composition of capital and established a common equity tier 1 capital ratio. common equity tier 1 capital primarily includes common stock, retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income (oci), net of deductions and adjustments primarily related to goodwill, deferred tax assets, intangibles and defined benefit pension assets. under the basel 3 regulatory capital transition provisions, certain deductions and adjustments to common equity tier 1 capital were phased in through january 1, 2018. in 2017, under the transition provisions, 80 percent of these deductions and adjustments was recognized. basel 3 also revised minimum capital ratios and buffer requirements, added a supplementary leverage ratio (slr), and addressed the adequately capitalized minimum requirements under the prompt corrective action (pca) framework. finally, basel 3 established two methods of calculating risk-weighted assets, the standardized approach and the advanced approaches. the standardized approach relies primarily on supervisory risk weights based on exposure type, and the advanced approaches determine risk weights based on internal models. during the fourth quarter of 2017, we obtained approval from u.s. banking regulators to use our internal models methodology (imm) to calculate counterparty credit risk-weighted assets for derivatives under the advanced approaches.
as an advanced approaches institution, we are required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and risk-weighted assets under both the standardized and advanced approaches. the approach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital adequacy including under the pca framework.
minimum capital requirements minimum capital requirements and related buffers are being phased in from january 1, 2014 through january 1, 2019. the pca framework establishes categories of capitalization including "well capitalized," based on the basel 3 regulatory ratio requirements. u.s. banking regulators are required to take certain mandatory actions depending on the category of capitalization, with no mandatory actions required for "well-capitalized" banking organizations, which included bana at december 31, 2017.
we are subject to a capital conservation buffer, a countercyclical capital buffer and a global systemically important bank (g-sib) surcharge that are being phased in over a three-year period ending january 1, 2019. once fully phased in, the corporation's risk-based capital ratio requirements will include a capital conservation buffer greater than 2.5 percent, plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer and a g-sib surcharge in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. the buffers and surcharge must be comprised solely of common equity tier 1 capital. under the phase-in provisions, we were required to maintain a capital conservation buffer greater than 1.25 percent plus a g-sib surcharge of 1.5 percent in 2017. the countercyclical capital buffer is currently set at zero. we estimate that our fully phased-in g-sib surcharge will
45 bank of america 2017
be 2.5 percent. the g-sib surcharge may differ from this estimate over time. for more information on the corporation's transition and fully phased-in capital ratios and regulatory requirements, see table 12.
supplementary leverage ratio basel 3 requires advanced approaches institutions to disclose an slr. the numerator of the slr is quarter-end basel 3 tier 1 capital. the denominator is total leverage exposure based on the daily average of the sum of on-balance sheet exposures less permitted tier 1 deductions, as well as the simple average of certain off-balance sheet exposures, as of the end of each month in a quarter. effective january 1, 2018, the corporation will be required to maintain a minimum slr of 3.0 percent, plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. insured depository institution subsidiaries of bhcs will be required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent slr to be considered "well capitalized" under the pca framework.
capital composition and ratios table 12 presents bank of america corporation's transition and fully phased-in capital ratios and related information in accordance with basel 3 standardized and advanced approaches as measured at december 31, 2017 and 2016. fully phased-in estimates are non-gaap financial measures that the corporation considers to be useful measures in evaluating compliance with new regulatory capital requirements that are not yet effective. for reconciliations to gaap financial measures, see table 15. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016, the corporation met the definition of "well capitalized" under current regulatory requirements.

(1)   as an advanced approaches institution, we are required to report regulatory capital risk-weighted assets and ratios under both the standardized and advanced approaches. the approach that yields the lower ratio is to be used to assess capital adequacy and was the advanced approaches method at december 31, 2017 and 2016.
(2)   under the applicable bank regulatory rules, we are not required to and, accordingly, will not restate previously-filed regulatory capital metrics and ratios in connection with the change in accounting method under gaap for stock-based compensation awards granted to retirement-eligible employees. therefore, the december 31, 2016 amounts in the table are as originally reported. the cumulative impact of the change in accounting method resulted in an insignificant pro forma change to our capital metrics and ratios. for more information, see note 1 - summary of significant accounting principles to the consolidated financial statements.
(3)   during the fourth quarter of 2017, we obtained approval from u.s. banking regulators to use our imm to calculate counterparty credit risk-weighted assets for derivatives under the advanced approaches. fully phased-in estimates for prior periods assumed approval.
(4)   the december 31, 2017 and 2016 amounts include a transition capital conservation buffer of 1.25 percent and 0.625 percent and a transition g-sib surcharge of 1.5 percent and 0.75 percent. the countercyclical capital buffer for both periods is zero.
(5)   fully phased-in regulatory minimums assume a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent and estimated g-sib surcharge of 2.5 percent. the estimated fully phased-in countercyclical capital buffer is zero. we will be subject to fully phased-in regulatory minimums on january 1, 2019. the fully phased-in slr minimum assumes a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent and is applicable on january 1, 2018.
(6)   total capital under the advanced approaches differs from the standardized approach due to differences in the amount permitted in tier 2 capital related to the qualifying allowance for credit losses.
(7)   reflects adjusted average total assets for the three months ended december 31, 2017 and 2016.

common equity tier 1 capital under basel 3 advanced - transition was $171.1 billion at december 31, 2017, an increase of $2.2 billion compared to december 31, 2016 driven by earnings and the exercise of warrants associated with the series t preferred stock, partially offset by common stock repurchases, dividends and the phase-in under basel 3 transition provisions of deductions, primarily related to deferred tax assets. during 2017, total capital decreased $452 million primarily driven by common stock repurchases, dividends, lower eligible credit reserves and tier 2
capital instruments, in addition to the phase-in of basel 3 transition provisions, partially offset by earnings.
risk-weighted assets decreased $81 billion during 2017 to $1,449 billion primarily due to the implementation of internal models methodology (imm) for derivatives, improvements in credit risk capital models, the sale of the non-u.s. consumer credit card business and continued run-off of non-core assets.

regulatory developments minimum total loss-absorbing capacity the federal reserve has established a final rule effective january 1, 2019, which includes minimum external total loss-absorbing capacity (tlac) requirements to improve the resolvability and resiliency of large, interconnected bhcs. we estimate our minimum required external tlac would be the greater of 22.5 percent of risk-weighted assets or 9.5 percent of slr leverage exposure. in addition, u.s. g-sibs must meet a minimum long-term debt requirement. our minimum required long-term debt is estimated to be the greater of 8.5 percent of risk-weighted assets or 4.5 percent of slr leverage exposure. as of december 31, 2017, the corporation's tlac and long-term debt exceeded our estimated 2019 minimum requirements.
revisions to approaches for measuring risk-weighted assets on december 7, 2017, the basel committee on banking supervision (basel committee) finalized several key methodologies for measuring risk-weighted assets. the revisions include a standardized approach for credit risk, standardized approach for operational risk, revisions to the credit valuation adjustment (cva) risk framework and constraints on the use of internal models. the basel committee had also previously finalized a revised standardized model for counterparty credit risk, revisions to the securitization framework and its fundamental review of the trading book, which updates both modeled and standardized approaches for market risk measurement. the revisions also include a capital floor set at 72.5 percent of total risk-weighted assets based on the revised standardized approaches to limit the extent to which banks can reduce risk-weighted asset levels through the use of internal models. u.s. banking regulators may update the u.s. basel 3 rules to incorporate the basel committee revisions.
revisions to the g-sib assessment framework on march 30, 2017, the basel committee issued a consultative document with proposed revisions to the g-sib surcharge assessment framework. the proposed revisions would include removing the cap on the substitutability category, expanding the scope of consolidation to include insurance subsidiaries in three categories (size, interconnectedness and complexity) and modifying the substitutability category weights with the introduction of a new trading volume indicator. the basel committee has also requested feedback on a new short-term wholesale funding indicator, which would be included in the interconnectedness category. the u.s. banking regulators may update the u.s. g-sib surcharge rule to incorporate the basel committee revisions.
broker-dealer regulatory capital and securities regulation the corporation's principal u.s. broker-dealer subsidiaries are merrill lynch, pierce, fenner & smith incorporated (mlpf&s) and merrill lynch professional clearing corp (mlpcc). mlpcc is a fully-guaranteed subsidiary of mlpf&s and provides clearing and settlement services. both entities are subject to the net capital requirements of securities and exchange commission (sec) rule 15c3-1. both entities are also registered as futures commission merchants and are subject to the commodity futures trading commission regulation 1.17.
mlpf&s has elected to compute the minimum capital requirement in accordance with the alternative net capital requirement as permitted by sec rule 15c3-1. at december 31, 2017, mlpf&s's regulatory net capital as defined by rule 15c3-1 was $12.4 billion and exceeded the minimum requirement of $1.7 billion by $10.7 billion. mlpcc's net capital of $3.4 billion exceeded the minimum requirement of $543 million by $2.9 billion.
in accordance with the alternative net capital requirements, mlpf&s is required to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $1.0 billion, net capital in excess of $500 million and notify the sec in the event its tentative net capital is less than $5.0 billion. at december 31, 2017, mlpf&s had tentative net capital and net capital in excess of the minimum and notification requirements.
merrill lynch international (mli), a u.k. investment firm, is regulated by the prudential regulation authority and the financial conduct authority, and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. at december 31, 2017, mli's capital resources were $35.1 billion which exceeded the minimum pillar 1 requirement of $16.5 billion.
liquidity risk funding and liquidity risk management our primary liquidity risk management objective is to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral needs while continuing to support our businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions. to achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk under expected and stressed conditions, maintain liquidity and access to diverse funding sources, including our stable deposit base, and seek to align liquidity-related incentives and risks.
we define liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations as those obligations arise. we manage our liquidity position through line of business and alm activities, as well as through our legal entity funding strategy, on both a forward and current (including intraday) basis under both expected and stressed conditions. we believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity management enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events.
the board approves our liquidity policy and the erc approves the contingency funding plan, including establishing liquidity risk tolerance levels. the mrc monitors our liquidity position and reviews the impact of strategic decisions on our liquidity. the mrc is responsible for overseeing liquidity risks and directing management to maintain exposures within the established tolerance levels. the mrc reviews and monitors our liquidity position, stress testing scenarios and results, and reviews and approves certain liquidity risk limits. for more information, see managing risk on page 41. under this governance framework, we have developed certain funding and liquidity risk management practices which include: maintaining liquidity at the parent company and selected subsidiaries, including our bank subsidiaries and other regulated entities; determining what amounts of liquidity are appropriate for these entities based on analysis of debt maturities and other potential cash outflows,
49 bank of america 2017
including those that we may experience during stressed market conditions; diversifying funding sources, considering our asset profile and legal entity structure; and performing contingency planning.
nb holdings corporation in 2016, we entered into intercompany arrangements with certain key subsidiaries under which we transferred certain of our parent company assets, and agreed to transfer certain additional parent company assets not needed to satisfy anticipated near-term expenditures, to nb holdings corporation, a wholly-owned holding company subsidiary (nb holdings). the parent company is expected to continue to have access to the same flow of dividends, interest and other amounts of cash necessary to service its debt, pay dividends and perform other obligations as it would have had if it had not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets.
in consideration for the transfer of assets, nb holdings issued a subordinated note to the parent company in a principal amount equal to the value of the transferred assets. the aggregate principal amount of the note will increase by the amount of any future asset transfers. nb holdings also provided the parent company with a committed line of credit that allows the parent company to draw funds necessary to service near-term cash needs. these arrangements support our preferred single point of entry resolution strategy, under which only the parent company would be resolved under the u.s. bankruptcy code. these arrangements include provisions to terminate the line of credit, forgive the subordinated note and require the parent company to transfer its remaining financial assets to nb holdings if our projected liquidity resources deteriorate so severely that resolution of the parent company becomes imminent.
global liquidity sources and other unencumbered assets we maintain liquidity available to the corporation, including the parent company and selected subsidiaries, in the form of cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. our liquidity buffer, referred to as global liquidity sources (gls), is comprised of assets that are readily available to the parent company and selected subsidiaries, including holding company, bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, even during stressed market conditions. our cash is primarily on deposit with the federal reserve and, to a lesser extent, central banks outside of the u.s. we limit the composition of high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities to u.s. government securities, u.s. agency securities, u.s. agency mbs and a select group of non-u.s. government securities. we can quickly obtain cash for these securities, even in stressed conditions, through repurchase agreements or outright sales. we hold our gls in legal entities that allow us to meet the liquidity requirements of our global businesses, and we consider the impact of potential regulatory, tax, legal and other restrictions that could limit the transferability of funds among entities.
for the three months ended december 31, 2017 and 2016, our average gls were $522 billion and $515 billion, as shown in table 17.

parent company and nb holdings average liquidity was $79 billion and $77 billion for the three months ended december 31, 2017 and 2016. the increase in parent company and nb holdings average liquidity was primarily due to debt issuances outpacing maturities. typically, parent company and nb holdings liquidity is in the form of cash deposited with bana.
average liquidity held at our bank subsidiaries was $394 billion and $389 billion for the three months ended december 31, 2017 and 2016. our bank subsidiaries' liquidity is primarily driven by deposit and lending activity, as well as securities valuation and net debt activity. liquidity at bank subsidiaries excludes the cash deposited by the parent company and nb holdings. our bank subsidiaries can also generate incremental liquidity by pledging a range of unencumbered loans and securities to certain fhlbs and the federal reserve discount window. the cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically-identified eligible assets was $308 billion and $310 billion at december 31, 2017 and 2016, with the decrease due to fhlb borrowings, which reduced available borrowing capacity, and adjustments to our valuation model. we have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. eligibility is defined in guidelines from the fhlbs and the federal reserve and is subject to change at their discretion. due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can generally be used only to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries, and transfers to the parent company or nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to prior regulatory approval.
average liquidity held at our other regulated entities, comprised primarily of broker-dealer subsidiaries, was $49 billion for both the three months ended december 31, 2017 and 2016. our other regulated entities also held unencumbered investment-grade securities and equities that we believe could be used to generate additional liquidity. liquidity held in an other regulated entity is primarily available to meet the obligations of that entity and transfers to the parent company or to any other subsidiary may be subject to prior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements.

our gls are substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as high quality liquid assets (hqla) under the final u.s. liquidity coverage ratio (lcr) rules. however, hqla for purposes of calculating lcr is not reported at market value, but at a lower value that incorporates regulatory deductions and the exclusion of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries. the lcr is calculated as the amount of a financial institution's unencumbered hqla relative to the estimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period of significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. for the three months ended december 31, 2017, our average consolidated hqla, on a net basis, was $439 billion and the average consolidated lcr was 125 percent. our lcr will fluctuate due to normal business flows from customer activity.
liquidity stress analysis and time-to-required funding we utilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our subsidiaries. the liquidity stress testing process is an integral part of analyzing our potential contractual and contingent cash outflows. we evaluate the liquidity requirements under a range of scenarios with varying levels of severity and time horizons. the scenarios we consider and utilize incorporate market-wide and corporation-specific events, including potential credit rating downgrades for the parent company and our subsidiaries, and more severe events including potential resolution scenarios. the scenarios are based on our historical experience, experience of distressed and failed financial institutions, regulatory guidance, and both expected and unexpected future events.
the types of potential contractual and contingent cash outflows we consider in our scenarios may include, but are not limited to, upcoming contractual maturities of unsecured debt and reductions in new debt issuance; diminished access to secured financing markets; potential deposit withdrawals; increased draws on loan commitments, liquidity facilities and letters of credit; additional collateral that counterparties could call if our credit ratings were downgraded; collateral and margin requirements arising from market value changes; and potential liquidity required to maintain businesses and finance customer activities. changes in certain market factors, including, but not limited to, credit rating downgrades, could negatively impact potential contractual and contingent outflows and the related financial instruments, and in some cases these impacts could be material to our financial results.
we consider all sources of funds that we could access during each stress scenario and focus particularly on matching available sources with corresponding liquidity requirements by legal entity.
we also use the stress modeling results to manage our asset and liability profile and establish limits and guidelines on certain funding sources and businesses.
we use a variety of metrics to determine the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our subsidiaries. one metric we use to evaluate the appropriate level of liquidity at the parent company and nb holdings is "time-to-required funding" (ttf). this debt coverage measure indicates the number of months the parent company can continue to meet its unsecured contractual obligations as they come due using only the parent company and nb holdings' liquidity sources without issuing any new debt or accessing any additional liquidity sources. we define unsecured contractual obligations for purposes of this metric as maturities of senior or subordinated debt issued or guaranteed by bank of america corporation. these include certain unsecured debt instruments, primarily structured liabilities, which we may be required to settle for cash prior to maturity. ttf was 49 months at december 31, 2017 compared to 35 months at december 31, 2016. the increase in ttf was driven by debt issuances outpacing maturities.
net stable funding ratio u.s. banking regulators issued a proposal for a net stable funding ratio (nsfr) requirement applicable to u.s. financial institutions following the basel committee's final standard. the proposed u.s. nsfr would apply to the corporation on a consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions. while the final requirement remains pending and is subject to change, if finalized as proposed, we expect to be in compliance within the regulatory timeline. the standard is intended to reduce funding risk over a longer time horizon. the nsfr is designed to provide an appropriate amount of stable funding, generally capital and liabilities maturing beyond one year, given the mix of assets and off-balance sheet items.
diversified funding sources we fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated funding approach diversified across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups.
the primary benefits of our centralized funding approach include greater control, reduced funding costs, wider name recognition by investors and greater flexibility to meet the variable funding requirements of subsidiaries. where regulations, time zone differences or other business considerations make parent company funding impractical, certain other subsidiaries may issue their own debt.
we fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits, which were $1.31 trillion and $1.26 trillion at december 31, 2017 and 2016. deposits are primarily generated by our consumer banking, gwim and global banking segments. these deposits are diversified by clients, product type and geography, and the majority of our u.s. deposits are insured by the fdic. we consider a substantial portion of our deposits to be a stable, low-cost and consistent source of funding. we believe this deposit funding is generally less sensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility or changes in our credit ratings than wholesale funding sources. our lending activities may also be financed through secured borrowings, including credit card securitizations and securitizations with government-sponsored enterprises, the federal housing administration (fha) and private-label investors, as well as fhlb loans.
51 bank of america 2017
our trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions. we believe funding these activities in the secured financing markets is more cost-efficient and less sensitive to changes in our credit ratings than unsecured financing. repurchase agreements are generally short-term and often overnight. disruptions in secured financing markets for financial institutions have occurred in prior market cycles which resulted in adverse changes in terms or significant reductions in the availability of such financing. we manage the liquidity risks arising from secured funding by sourcing funding globally from a diverse group of counterparties, providing a range of securities collateral and pursuing longer durations, when appropriate. for more information on secured financing agreements, see note 10 - federal funds sold or purchased, securities financing agreements and short-term borrowings to the consolidated financial statements.
we issue long-term unsecured debt in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve cost-efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity profile. while the cost and availability of unsecured funding may be negatively impacted by general market conditions or by matters specific to the financial services industry or the corporation, we seek to mitigate refinancing risk by actively managing the amount of our borrowings that we anticipate will mature within any month or quarter.
during 2017, we issued $53.3 billion of long-term debt consisting of $37.7 billion for bank of america corporation, substantially all of which was tlac compliant, $8.2 billion for bank of america, n.a. and $7.4 billion of other debt.
in december 2017, pursuant to a private offering, we exchanged $11.0 billion of outstanding long-term debt for new fixed/floating-rate senior notes, subject to certain terms and conditions, to extend maturities and improve the structure of this debt for tlac purposes. based on the attributes of the exchange transactions, the newly issued securities are not considered substantially different, for accounting purposes, from the exchanged securities. therefore, there was no impact to our results of operations as any amounts paid to debt holders were capitalized, and the premiums or discounts on the outstanding long-term debt were carried over to the new securities and will be amortized over their contractual lives using a revised effective interest rate.

total long-term debt increased $10.6 billion, or five percent, in 2017, primarily due to issuances outpacing maturities. we may, from time to time, purchase outstanding debt instruments in various transactions, depending on prevailing market conditions, liquidity and other factors. in addition, our other regulated entities may make markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for investors.
we use derivative transactions to manage the duration, interest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the characteristics of the assets they are funding. for more information on our alm activities, see interest rate risk management for the banking book on page 81.
we may also issue unsecured debt in the form of structured notes for client purposes, certain of which qualify as tlac eligible debt. during 2017, we issued $5.4 billion of structured notes, which are debt obligations that pay investors returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. we typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivatives and/or investments in the underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. we could be required to settle certain structured note obligations for cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. we believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date.
substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price. for more information on long-term debt funding, see note 11 - long-term debt to the consolidated financial statements.
contingency planning we maintain contingency funding plans that outline our potential responses to liquidity stress events at various levels of severity. these policies and plans are based on stress scenarios and include potential funding strategies and communication and notification procedures that we would implement in the event we experienced stressed liquidity conditions. we periodically review and test the contingency funding plans to validate efficacy and assess readiness.
our u.s. bank subsidiaries can access contingency funding through the federal reserve discount window. certain non-u.s. subsidiaries have access to central bank facilities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. while we do not rely on these sources in our liquidity modeling, we maintain the policies, procedures and governance processes that would enable us to access these sources if necessary.
credit ratings our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are impacted by our credit ratings. in addition, credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions, including over-the-counter (otc) derivatives. thus, it is our objective to maintain high-quality credit ratings, and management maintains an active dialogue with the major rating agencies.
credit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities, including asset securitizations. our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies, and they consider a number of factors, including our own financial strength, performance, prospects and operations as well as factors not under our control. the rating agencies could make adjustments to our ratings at any time, and bank of america 2017 52
they provide no assurances that they will maintain our ratings at current levels.
other factors that influence our credit ratings include changes to the rating agencies' methodologies for our industry or certain security types; the rating agencies' assessment of the general operating environment for financial services companies; our relative positions in the markets in which we compete; our various risk exposures and risk management policies and activities; pending litigation and other contingencies or potential tail risks; our reputation; our liquidity position, diversity of funding sources and funding costs; the current and expected level and volatility of our earnings; our capital position and capital management practices; our corporate governance; the sovereign credit ratings of the u.s. government; current or future regulatory and legislative initiatives; and the agencies' views on whether the u.s. government would provide meaningful support to the corporation or its subsidiaries in a crisis.
on december 6, 2017, moody's investors services, inc. (moody's) upgraded the long-term ratings of bank of america corporation and certain subsidiaries, including bana, by one notch, moving their senior debt ratings to a3 and aa3, respectively. the upgrade was based on the agency's expectations for continued improvement in the corporation's profitability and management's continued commitment to a conservative risk profile. at the same time, moody's affirmed all the short-term ratings for bank of america corporation and its rated subsidiaries. moody's concurrently moved the outlook on the ratings to stable. this action concluded the review for upgrade that moody's initiated on september 12, 2017.
on november 22, 2017, standard & poor's global ratings (s&p) upgraded bank of america corporation's long-term senior debt rating to a- from bbb+ following the agency's periodic review of our ratings. s&p cited the improvement in the corporation's risk profile, while continuing to improve profitability metrics, as the driver for the upgrade, including tightening underwriting standards, reducing exposure to market risk, growing conservatively, and resolving legacy legal issues. s&p concurrently affirmed the ratings of the corporation's rated core operating subsidiaries, including bana, mlpf&s, mli and bank of america merrill lynch international limited. those entities were affirmed rather than upgraded since their ratings had reached an inflection point under s&p's methodology where the one notch s&p added to its assessment of our intrinsic creditworthiness (called an unsupported group credit profile, or ugcp) resulted in the subsidiaries receiving one less notch of support uplift under the agency's additional loss absorbing capacity framework, thus leaving those entities' ratings unchanged. s&p retained a stable outlook on the ratings of bank of america corporation and its core operating subsidiaries following the upgrade.
on september 28, 2017, fitch ratings (fitch) completed its latest review of 12 large, complex securities trading and universal banks, including bank of america. the agency affirmed the long-term and short-term senior debt ratings of bank of america corporation and its rated subsidiaries, including bana, and maintained its stable outlook on those ratings.

while certain potential impacts are contractual and quantifiable, the full scope of the consequences of a credit rating downgrade to a financial institution is inherently uncertain, as it depends upon numerous dynamic, complex and inter-related factors and assumptions, including whether any downgrade of a company's long-term credit ratings precipitates downgrades to its short-term credit ratings, and assumptions about the potential behaviors of various customers, investors and counterparties. for more information on potential impacts of credit rating downgrades, see liquidity risk - time-to-required funding and liquidity stress analysis on page 51.
for more information on the additional collateral and termination payments that could be required in connection with certain otc derivative contracts and other trading agreements as a result of such a credit rating downgrade, see note 2 - derivatives to the consolidated financial statements.

credit risk management credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability or failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its obligations. credit risk can also arise from operational failures that result in an erroneous advance, commitment or investment of funds. we define the credit exposure to a borrower or counterparty as the loss potential arising from all product classifications including loans and leases, deposit overdrafts, derivatives, assets held-for-sale and unfunded lending commitments which include loan commitments, letters of credit and financial guarantees. derivative positions are recorded at fair value and assets held-for-sale are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value. certain loans and unfunded commitments are accounted for under the fair value option. credit risk for categories of assets carried at fair value is not accounted for as part of the allowance for credit losses but as part of the fair value adjustments recorded in earnings. for derivative positions, our credit risk is measured as the net cost in the event the counterparties with contracts in which we are in a gain position fail to perform under the terms of those contracts. we use the current fair value to represent credit exposure without giving consideration to future mark-to-market changes. the credit risk amounts take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral. our consumer and commercial credit extension and review procedures encompass funded and unfunded credit exposures. for more information on derivatives and credit extension commitments, see note 2 - derivatives and note 12 - commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements.
we manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower or counterparty, repayment sources, the nature of underlying collateral, and other support given current events, conditions and expectations. we classify our portfolios as either consumer or commercial and monitor credit risk in each as discussed below.
we refine our underwriting and credit risk management practices as well as credit standards to meet the changing economic environment. to mitigate losses and enhance customer support in our consumer businesses, we have in place collection programs and loan modification and customer assistance infrastructures. we utilize a number of actions to mitigate losses in the commercial businesses including increasing the frequency and intensity of portfolio monitoring, hedging activity and our practice of transferring management of deteriorating commercial exposures to independent special asset officers as credits enter criticized categories.
for more information on our credit risk management activities, see consumer portfolio credit risk management below, commercial portfolio credit risk management on page 63, non-u.s. portfolio on page 70, provision for credit losses on page 72, allowance for credit losses on page 72, and note 4 - outstanding loans and leases and note 5 - allowance for credit losses to the consolidated financial statements.
during the third quarter of 2017, hurricanes impacted the southern united states and the caribbean, bringing widespread flooding and wind damage to communities across the region. in the weeks after these storms, we supported our customers and clients in these communities by providing mobile financial centers and atms. in addition, we provided support for the recovery efforts including proactive fee refunds in affected areas, as well as home loan and other credit assistance, including payment deferrals, for impacted individuals and businesses. we do not believe that these storms will have a material financial impact on the corporation.
consumer portfolio credit risk management credit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower's credit cycle. statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns. statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources such as credit bureaus and/or internal historical experience and are a component of our consumer credit risk management process. these models are used in part to assist in making both new and ongoing credit decisions, as well as portfolio management strategies, including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, and determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allocated capital for credit risk.
consumer credit portfolio improvement in the u.s. unemployment rate and home prices continued during 2017 resulting in improved credit quality and lower credit losses in the consumer real estate portfolio, partially offset by seasoning and loan growth in the u.s. credit card portfolio compared to 2016.
improved credit quality, the sale of the non-u.s. consumer credit card business in 2017, continued loan balance run-off and sales in the consumer real estate portfolio drove a $839 million decrease in the consumer allowance for loan and lease losses in 2017 to $5.4 billion at december 31, 2017. for more information, see allowance for credit losses on page 72.
for more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, charge-offs and troubled debt restructurings (tdrs) for the consumer portfolio, including those related to bankruptcy and repossession, see note 1 - summary of significant accounting principles to the consolidated financial statements.
table 21 presents our outstanding consumer loans and leases, consumer nonperforming loans and accruing consumer loans past due 90 days or more. nonperforming loans do not include past due consumer credit card loans, other unsecured loans and in general, consumer loans not secured by real estate (bankruptcy loans are included) as these loans are typically charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. real estate-secured past due consumer loans that are insured by the fha or individually insured under long-term standby agreements with fannie mae (fnma) and freddie mac (fhlmc) (collectively, the fully-insured loan portfolio) are reported as accruing as opposed to nonperforming since the principal repayment is insured. fully-insured loans included in accruing past due 90 days or more are primarily from our repurchases of delinquent fha loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with the government national mortgage association (gnma). additionally, nonperforming loans and accruing balances past due 90 days or more do not include the pci loan portfolio or loans accounted for under the fair value option even though the customer may be contractually past due.

we believe that the presentation of information adjusted to exclude the impact of the pci loan portfolio, the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option is more representative of the ongoing operations and credit quality of the business. as a result, in the following discussions of the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios, we provide information that excludes the impact of the pci loan portfolio, the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option in certain credit quality statistics. we separately disclose information on the pci loan portfolio on page 60.
residential mortgage the residential mortgage portfolio makes up the largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio at 45 percent of consumer loans and leases at december 31, 2017. approximately 37 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio is in consumer banking and approximately 35 percent is in gwim. the remaining portion is in all other and is comprised of originated loans, purchased loans used in our overall alm activities, delinquent fha loans repurchased pursuant to our servicing agreements with gnma as well as loans repurchased related to our representations and warranties.
outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, increased $12.0 billion in 2017 as retention of new originations was partially offset by loan sales of $3.9 billion, and run-off.
at december 31, 2017 and 2016, the residential mortgage portfolio included $23.7 billion and $28.7 billion of outstanding fully-insured loans. on this portion of the residential mortgage portfolio, we are protected against principal loss as a result of either fha insurance or long-term standby agreements that provide for the transfer of credit risk to fnma and fhlmc. at december 31, 2017 and 2016, $17.4 billion and $22.3 billion had fha insurance with the remainder protected by long-term standby agreements. at december 31, 2017 and 2016, $5.2 billion and $7.4 billion of the fha-insured loan population were repurchases of delinquent fha loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with gnma.

nonperforming residential mortgage loans decreased $580 million in 2017 as outflows, including sales of $460 million and net transfers to held-for-sale of $132 million, outpaced new inflows which included the addition of $140 million of nonperforming loans as a result of clarifying regulatory guidance related to bankruptcy loans. of the nonperforming residential mortgage loans at december 31, 2017, $860 million, or 35 percent, were current on contractual payments. loans accruing past due 30 days or more decreased $314 million due in part to the timing impact of a consumer real estate servicer conversion that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2016.
net charge-offs decreased $231 million to $100 million of net recoveries in 2017 compared to $131 million of net charge-offs in 2016. this decrease in net charge-offs was primarily driven by net recoveries of $105 million related to loan sales in 2017, compared to loan sale-related net charge-offs of $26 million in 2016. additionally, net charge-offs declined due to favorable portfolio trends and decreased write-downs on loans greater than 180 days past due driven by improvement in home prices and the u.s. economy.
loans with a refreshed ltv greater than 100 percent represented one percent and three percent of the residential mortgage loan portfolio at december 31, 2017 and 2016. of the loans with a refreshed ltv greater than 100 percent, 98 percent were performing at both december 31, 2017 and 2016. loans with a refreshed ltv greater than 100 percent reflect loans where the outstanding carrying value of the loan is greater than the most recent valuation of the property securing the loan. the majority of these loans have a refreshed ltv greater than 100 percent primarily due to home price deterioration since 2006, partially offset by subsequent appreciation.
of the $172.1 billion in total residential mortgage loans outstanding at december 31, 2017, as shown in table 25, 33
percent were originated as interest-only loans. the outstanding balance of interest-only residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period was $10.4 billion, or 18 percent, at december 31, 2017. residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period generally have experienced a higher rate of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status compared to the residential mortgage portfolio as a whole. at december 31, 2017, $283 million, or three percent of outstanding interest-only residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $1.5 billion, or one percent for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. in addition, at december 31, 2017, $509 million, or five percent of outstanding interest-only residential mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $253 million were contractually current, compared to $2.5 billion, or one percent for the entire residential mortgage portfolio, of which $860 million were contractually current. loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only residential mortgage portfolio are primarily well-collateralized loans to our wealth management clients and have an interest-only period of three to ten years. more than 80 percent of these loans that have yet to enter the amortization period will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2020 or later.
table 25 presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio. the los angeles-long beach-santa ana metropolitan statistical area (msa) within california represented 16 percent and 15 percent of outstandings at december 31, 2017 and 2016. in the new york area, the new york-northern new jersey-long island msa made up 13 percent and 12 percent of outstandings at december 31, 2017 and 2016.

home equity at december 31, 2017, the home equity portfolio made up 13 percent of the consumer portfolio and is comprised of home equity lines of credit (helocs), home equity loans and reverse mortgages.
at december 31, 2017, our heloc portfolio had an outstanding balance of $51.2 billion, or 89 percent of the total home equity portfolio compared to $58.6 billion, or 88 percent, at december 31, 2016. helocs generally have an initial draw period of 10 years and after the initial draw period ends, the loans generally convert to 15-year amortizing loans.
at december 31, 2017, our home equity loan portfolio had an outstanding balance of $4.4 billion, or seven percent of the total home equity portfolio compared to $5.9 billion, or nine percent, at december 31, 2016. home equity loans are almost all fixed-rate loans with amortizing payment terms of 10 to 30 years and of the $4.4 billion at december 31, 2017, 57 percent have 25- to 30-year terms. at december 31, 2017, our reverse mortgage portfolio had an outstanding balance, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, of $2.1 billion, or four percent of the total home equity portfolio compared to $1.9 billion, or three percent, at december 31, 2016. we no longer originate reverse mortgages.
at december 31, 2017, approximately 69 percent of the home equity portfolio was in consumer banking, 23 percent was in all other and the remainder of the portfolio was primarily in gwim. outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, decreased $8.7 billion in 2017 primarily due to paydowns and charge-offs outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines. of the total home equity portfolio at december 31, 2017 and 2016, $18.7 billion and $19.6 billion, or 32 percent and 29 percent, were in first-lien positions (34 percent and 31 percent excluding the pci home equity portfolio). at december 31, 2017, outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio that were in a second-lien or more junior-lien position and where we also held the first-lien loan totaled $9.4 billion, or 17 percent of our total home equity portfolio excluding the pci loan portfolio.
unused helocs totaled $44.2 billion and $47.2 billion at december 31, 2017 and 2016. the decrease was primarily due to accounts reaching the end of their draw period, which automatically eliminates open line exposure, and customers choosing to close accounts. both of these more than offset the impact of new production. the heloc utilization rate was 54 percent and 55 percent at december 31, 2017 and 2016.

nonperforming outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $274 million in 2017 as outflows, including $66 million of net transfers to held-for-sale and $51 million of sales, outpaced new inflows, which included the addition of $135 million of nonperforming loans as a result of clarifying regulatory guidance related to bankruptcy loans. of the nonperforming home equity portfolio at december 31, 2017, $1.4 billion, or 54 percent, were current on contractual payments. nonperforming loans that are contractually current primarily consist of collateral-dependent tdrs, including those that have been discharged in chapter 7 bankruptcy, junior-lien loans where the underlying first-lien is 90 days or more past due, as well as loans that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance following a tdr. in addition, $693 million, or 26 percent, of nonperforming home equity loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. accruing loans that were 30 days or more past due decreased $64 million in 2017.
in some cases, the junior-lien home equity outstanding balance that we hold is performing, but the underlying first-lien is not. for outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio on which we service the first-lien loan, we are able to track whether the first-lien loan is in default. for loans where the first-lien is serviced by a third party, we utilize credit bureau data to estimate the delinquency status of the first-lien. given that the credit bureau database we use does not include a property address for the mortgages, we are unable to identify with certainty whether a reported delinquent first-lien mortgage pertains to the same property for which we hold a junior-lien loan. for certain loans, we utilize a third-party vendor to combine credit bureau and public record data to better link a junior-lien loan with the underlying first-lien mortgage. at december 31, 2017, we estimate that $814 million of current and $141 million of 30 to 89 days past due junior-lien loans were behind a delinquent first-lien loan. we service the first-lien loans on $184 million of these combined amounts, with the remaining $771 million serviced by third parties. of the $955 million of current to 89 days past due junior-lien loans, based on available credit bureau data and our own internal servicing data, we estimate that approximately $330 million had first-lien loans that were 90 days or more past due.
net charge-offs decreased $192 million to $213 million in 2017 compared to $405 million in 2016 driven by favorable portfolio trends due in part to improvement in home prices and the u.s. economy, partially offset by $32 million of charge-offs as a result of clarifying regulatory guidance related to bankruptcy loans.
outstanding balances with a refreshed cltv greater than 100 percent comprised four percent and seven percent of the home equity portfolio at december 31, 2017 and 2016. outstanding balances with a refreshed cltv greater than 100 percent reflect loans where our loan and available line of credit combined with any outstanding senior liens against the property are equal to or greater than the most recent valuation of the property securing the loan. depending on the value of the property, there may be collateral in excess of the first-lien that is available to reduce the severity of loss on the second-lien. of those outstanding balances with a refreshed cltv greater than 100 percent, 95 percent of the customers were current on their home equity loan and 91 percent of second-lien loans with a refreshed cltv greater than 100 percent were current on both their second-lien and underlying first-lien loans at december 31, 2017.
of the $55.0 billion in total home equity portfolio outstandings at december 31, 2017, as shown in table 27, 30 percent require interest-only payments. the outstanding balance of helocs that have reached the end of their draw period and have entered the amortization period was $18.4 billion at december 31, 2017. the helocs that have entered the amortization period have experienced a higher percentage of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status when compared to the heloc portfolio as a whole. at december 31, 2017, $343 million, or two percent, of outstanding helocs that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more. in addition, at december 31, 2017, $2.1 billion, or 11 percent, of outstanding helocs that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $1.1 billion were contractually current. loans in our heloc portfolio generally have an initial draw period of 10 years and 10 percent of these loans will enter the amortization period during 2018 and will be required to make fully-amortizing payments. we communicate to contractually current customers more than a year
59 bank of america 2017
prior to the end of their draw period to inform them of the potential change to the payment structure before entering the amortization period, and provide payment options to customers prior to the end of the draw period.
although we do not actively track how many of our home equity customers pay only the minimum amount due on their home equity loans and lines, we can infer some of this information through a review of our heloc portfolio that we service and that is still in its revolving period (i.e., customers may draw on and repay their line of credit, but are generally only required to pay interest on a monthly basis). during 2017, approximately 19 percent of these customers with an outstanding balance did not pay any principal on their helocs.
table 27 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the home equity portfolio. in the new york area, the new york-northern new jersey-long island msa made up 13 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both december 31, 2017 and 2016. loans within this msa contributed 27 percent and 17 percent of net charge-offs in 2017 and 2016 within the home equity portfolio. the los angeles-long beach-santa ana msa within california made up 11 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both december 31, 2017 and 2016. loans within this msa contributed net recoveries of $20 million and $2 million within the home equity portfolio in 2017 and 2016.

the total pci unpaid principal balance decreased $3.1 billion, or 22 percent, in 2017 primarily driven by payoffs, paydowns, write-offs and pci loan sales with a carrying value of $803 million compared to $549 million in 2016.

outstandings in the u.s. credit card portfolio increased $4.0 billion to $96.3 billion in 2017 as retail volumes outpaced payments. net charge-offs increased $244 million to $2.5 billion in 2017 due to portfolio seasoning and loan growth. u.s. credit card loans 30 days or more past due and still accruing interest increased $252 million and loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest increased $118 million in 2017, driven by portfolio seasoning and loan growth.
unused lines of credit for u.s. credit card totaled $326.3 billion and $321.6 billion at december 31, 2017 and 2016. the increase was driven by account growth and lines of credit increases.

nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity table 31 presents nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity during 2017 and 2016. for more information on nonperforming loans, see note 1 - summary of significant accounting principles and note 4 - outstanding loans and leases to the consolidated financial statements. during 2017, nonperforming consumer loans declined $838 million to $5.2 billion driven in part by loan sales of $511 million and net transfers of loans to held-for-sale of $198 million. additionally, nonperforming loans declined as outflows outpaced new inflows, which included the addition of $295 million of nonperforming loans as a result of clarifying regulatory guidance related to bankruptcy loans.
at december 31, 2017, $1.9 billion, or 34 percent of nonperforming consumer real estate loans and foreclosed properties had been written down to their estimated property value less costs to sell, including $1.6 billion of nonperforming loans 180 days or more past due and $236 million of foreclosed properties. in addition, at december 31, 2017, $2.3 billion, or 45 percent of nonperforming consumer loans were modified and are now current after successful trial periods, or are current loans classified as nonperforming loans in accordance with applicable policies.
foreclosed properties decreased $127 million in 2017 as liquidations outpaced additions. pci loans are excluded from nonperforming loans as these loans were written down to fair value at the acquisition date; however, once we acquire the underlying real estate upon foreclosure of the delinquent pci loan, it is included in foreclosed properties. not included in foreclosed properties at december 31, 2017 was $801 million of real estate that was acquired upon foreclosure of certain delinquent government-guaranteed loans (principally fha-insured loans). we exclude these amounts from our nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties activity as we expect we will be reimbursed once the property is conveyed to the guarantor for principal and, up to certain limits, costs incurred during the foreclosure process and interest accrued during the holding period.
we classify junior-lien home equity loans as nonperforming when the first-lien loan becomes 90 days past due even if the junior-lien loan is performing. at december 31, 2017 and 2016, $330 million and $428 million of such junior-lien home equity loans were included in nonperforming loans and leases.
nonperforming loans also include certain loans that have been modified in tdrs where economic concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. nonperforming tdrs, excluding those modified loans in the pci loan portfolio, are included in table 31.

(1)   at december 31, 2017 and 2016, residential mortgage tdrs deemed collateral dependent totaled $2.8 billion and $3.5 billion, and included $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion of loans classified as nonperforming and $1.6 billion and $1.9 billion of loans classified as performing.
(2)   residential mortgage performing tdrs included $3.7 billion and $5.3 billion of loans that were fully-insured at december 31, 2017 and 2016.
(3)   home equity tdrs deemed collateral dependent totaled $1.6 billion for both periods and included $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion of loans classified as nonperforming, and $388 million and $301 million of loans classified as performing at december 31, 2017 and 2016.
in addition to modifying consumer real estate loans, we work with customers who are experiencing financial difficulty by modifying credit card and other consumer loans. credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve a reduction in the customer's interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months, all of which are considered tdrs (the renegotiated tdr portfolio).
modifications of credit card and other consumer loans are made through renegotiation programs utilizing direct customer contact, but may also utilize external renegotiation programs. the renegotiated tdr portfolio is excluded in large part from table 31 as substantially all of the loans remain on accrual status until either charged off or paid in full. at december 31, 2017 and 2016, our renegotiated tdr portfolio was $490 million and $610 million, of which $426 million and $493 million were current or less than 30 days past due under the modified terms. the decline in the renegotiated tdr portfolio was primarily driven by paydowns and charge-offs as well as lower program enrollments. for more information on the renegotiated tdr portfolio, see note 4 - outstanding loans and leases to the consolidated financial statements.
commercial portfolio credit risk management credit risk management for the commercial portfolio begins with an assessment of the credit risk profile of the borrower or counterparty based on an analysis of its financial position. as part of the overall credit risk assessment, our commercial credit exposures are assigned a risk rating and are subject to approval based on defined credit approval standards. subsequent to loan origination, risk ratings are monitored on an ongoing basis, and if necessary, adjusted to reflect changes in the financial condition, cash flow, risk profile or outlook of a borrower or counterparty. in making credit decisions, we consider risk rating, collateral, country, industry and single-name concentration limits while also balancing these considerations with the total borrower or counterparty relationship. we use a variety of tools to continuously monitor the ability of a borrower or counterparty to perform under its obligations. we use risk rating aggregations to measure and evaluate concentrations within portfolios. in addition, risk ratings are a factor in determining the level of allocated capital and the allowance for credit losses.
as part of our ongoing risk mitigation initiatives, we attempt to work with clients experiencing financial difficulty to modify their loans to terms that better align with their current ability to pay. in situations where an economic concession has been granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, we identify these loans as tdrs. for more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status and net charge-offs for the commercial portfolio, see note 1 - summary of significant accounting principles to the consolidated financial statements.
management of commercial credit risk concentrations commercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations of credit exposure do not result in undesirable levels of risk. we review, measure and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship and loan size. we also review, measure and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type. in addition, within our non-u.s. portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by country. tables 37, 40, 45 and 46 summarize our concentrations. we also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio. for more information on our industry concentrations, including our utilized exposure to the energy sector which was three percent of total commercial utilized exposure at both december 31, 2017 and 2016, see commercial portfolio credit risk management - industry concentrations on page 67 and table 40.
we account for certain large corporate loans and loan commitments, including issued but unfunded letters of credit which are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes, that exceed our single-name credit risk concentration guidelines under the fair value option. lending commitments, both funded and unfunded, are actively managed and monitored, and as appropriate, credit risk for these lending relationships may be mitigated through the use of credit derivatives, with our credit view and market perspectives determining the size and timing of the hedging activity. in addition, we purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain other credit exposures. to lessen the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, credit exposure may be added within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. these credit derivatives do not meet the requirements for treatment as accounting hedges. they are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income.
in addition, we are a member of various securities and derivative exchanges and clearinghouses, both in the u.s. and other countries. as a member, we may be required to pay a pro-rata share of the losses incurred by some of these organizations as a result of another member default and under other loss scenarios. for more information, see note 12 - commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements.

commercial credit portfolio during 2017, credit quality among large corporate borrowers was strong, other than in the higher risk energy sub-sectors, where we saw improvement in 2017. credit quality of commercial real estate borrowers continued to be strong with conservative ltv ratios, stable market rents in most sectors and vacancy rates remaining low.
total commercial utilized credit exposure increased $25.9 billion during 2017 to $600.8 billion at december 31, 2017 primarily driven by increases in loans and leases. the utilization rate for loans and leases, sblcs and financial guarantees, and commercial letters of credit, in the aggregate, was 59 percent and 58 percent at december 31, 2017 and 2016.
table 33 presents commercial credit exposure by type for utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure. commercial utilized credit exposure includes sblcs and financial guarantees and commercial letters of credit that have been issued and for which we are legally bound to advance funds under prescribed conditions during a specified time period, and excludes exposure related to trading account assets. although funds have not yet been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes.

industry concentrations table 40 presents commercial committed and utilized credit exposure by industry and the total net credit default protection purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portions of certain credit exposures. our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. total commercial committed exposure increased $30.1 billion, or three percent, in 2017 to $981.2 billion at december 31, 2017. the increase in commercial committed exposure was concentrated in the media, food & staples retailing, capital goods, food, beverage and tobacco and the asset managers and funds sectors. increases were partially offset by reduced exposure to the healthcare equipment and services, telecommunications services and the technology hardware and equipment sectors.
industry limits are used internally to manage industry concentrations and are based on committed exposure that is allocated on an industry-by-industry basis. a risk management framework is in place to set and approve industry limits as well as to provide ongoing monitoring. the mrc oversees industry limit governance.
asset managers and funds, our largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $91.1 billion, increased $5.5 billion, or six percent, in 2017. the increase primarily reflected an increase in exposure to several counterparties.

risk mitigation we purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. to lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, we may add credit exposure within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection.
at december 31, 2017 and 2016, net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was $2.1 billion and $3.5 billion. we recorded net losses of $66 million in 2017 compared to net losses of $438 million in 2016 on these positions. the gains and losses on these instruments were offset by gains and losses on the related exposures. the value-at-risk (var) results for these exposures are included in the fair value option portfolio information in table 49. for more information, see trading risk management on page 77.

in addition to our net notional credit default protection purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portion of certain credit exposures, credit derivatives are used for market-making activities for clients and establishing positions intended to profit from directional or relative value changes. we execute the majority of our credit derivative trades in the otc market with large, multinational financial institutions, including broker-dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of other investors. because these transactions are executed in the otc market, we are subject to settlement risk. we are also subject to credit risk in the event that these counterparties fail to perform under the terms of these contracts. in most cases, credit derivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis. therefore, events such as a credit downgrade, depending on the ultimate rating level, or a breach of credit covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral required by the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow us to take additional protective measures such as early termination of all trades.
table 43 presents the total contract/notional amount of credit derivatives outstanding and includes both purchased and written credit derivatives. the credit risk amounts are measured as net asset exposure by counterparty, taking into consideration all contracts with the counterparty. for more information on our written credit derivatives, see note 2 - derivatives to the consolidated financial statements.
the credit risk amounts discussed above and presented in table 43 take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements while amounts disclosed in note 2 - derivatives to the consolidated financial statements are shown on a gross basis. credit risk reflects the potential benefit from offsetting exposure to non-credit derivative products with the same counterparties that may be netted upon the occurrence of certain events, thereby reducing our overall exposure.

counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments we record counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments on certain derivative assets, including our credit default protection purchased, in order to properly reflect the credit risk of the counterparty, as presented in table 44. we calculate cva based on a modeled expected exposure that incorporates current market risk factors including changes in market spreads and non-credit related market factors that affect the value of a derivative. the exposure also takes into consideration credit mitigants such as legally enforceable master netting agreements and collateral. for more information, see note 2 - derivatives to the consolidated financial statements.
we enter into risk management activities to offset market driven exposures. we often hedge the counterparty spread risk in cva with credit default swaps (cds). we hedge other market risks in cva primarily with currency and interest rate swaps. in certain instances, the net-of-hedge amounts in the following table move in the same direction as the gross amount or may move in the opposite direction. this movement is a consequence of the complex interaction of the risks being hedged, resulting in limitations in the ability to perfectly hedge all of the market exposures at all times.

non-u.s. portfolio our non-u.s. credit and trading portfolios are subject to country risk. we define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies. a risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor and manage non-u.s. risk and exposures. in addition to the direct risk of doing business in a country, we also are exposed to indirect country risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on secured financing transactions or related to client clearing activities). these indirect exposures are managed in the normal course of business through credit, market and operational risk governance, rather than through country risk governance.
table 45 presents our 20 largest non-u.s. country exposures as of december 31, 2017. these exposures accounted for 86 percent and 88 percent of our total non-u.s. exposure at december 31, 2017 and 2016. net country exposure for these 20 countries decreased $6.3 billion in 2017 primarily driven by reductions in the u.k., japan, switzerland and brazil, partially offset by increases in china and belgium. on a product basis, funded commitments decreased in the u.k., japan and brazil, partially offset by increases in china, belgium and france. the decrease in the u.k. reflects the sale of the non-u.s. consumer credit card business in 2017. unfunded commitments increased in the u.k., germany and belgium, which was partly offset by a decrease in switzerland. securities held decreased, driven by reduced holdings in france, the u.k. and germany, while counterparty exposure decreased in japan, germany and the u.k.
non-u.s. exposure is presented on an internal risk management basis and includes sovereign and non-sovereign credit exposure, securities and other investments issued by or domiciled in countries other than the u.s.
funded loans and loan equivalents include loans, leases, and other extensions of credit and funds, including letters of credit and due from placements. unfunded commitments are the undrawn portion of legally binding commitments related to loans and loan equivalents. net counterparty exposure includes the fair value of derivatives, including the counterparty risk associated with cds, and secured financing transactions. securities and other investments are carried at fair value and long securities exposures are netted against short exposures with the same underlying issuer to, but not below, zero. net country exposure represents country exposure less hedges and credit default protection purchased, net of credit default protection sold.

a number of economic conditions and geopolitical events have given rise to risk aversion in certain emerging markets. our two largest emerging market country exposures at december 31, 2017 were china and brazil. at december 31, 2017, net exposure to china was $15.9 billion, concentrated in large state-owned companies, subsidiaries of multinational corporations and commercial banks. at december 31, 2017, net exposure to brazil was $10.7 billion, concentrated in sovereign securities, oil and gas companies and commercial banks.
the outlook for policy direction and therefore economic performance in the eu remains uncertain as a consequence of reduced political cohesion among eu countries. additionally, we believe that the uncertainty in the u.k.'s ability to negotiate a favorable exit from the eu will further weigh on economic performance. our largest eu country exposure at december 31, 2017 was the u.k. with net exposure of $37.6 billion, concentrated in multinational corporations and sovereign clients. for more information, see executive summary - 2017 economic and business environment on page 19.
table 46 presents countries where total cross-border exposure exceeded one percent of our total assets. at december 31, 2017, the u.k. and france were the only countries where total cross-border exposure exceeded one percent of our total assets. at december 31, 2017, germany had total cross-border exposure of $21.6 billion representing 0.95 percent of our total assets. no other countries had total cross-border exposure that exceeded 0.75 percent of our total assets at december 31, 2017.
cross-border exposure includes the components of country risk exposure as detailed in table 45 as well as the notional amount of cash loaned under secured financing agreements. local exposure, defined as exposure booked in local offices of a respective country with clients in the same country, is excluded.

provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses decreased $201 million to $3.4 billion in 2017 compared to 2016. the provision for credit losses was $583 million lower than net charge-offs for 2017, resulting in a reduction in the allowance for credit losses. this compared to a reduction of $224 million in the allowance in 2016.
the provision for credit losses for the consumer portfolio increased $159 million to $2.7 billion in 2017 compared to 2016. the increase was primarily driven by a provision increase of $672 million in the u.s. credit card portfolio due to portfolio seasoning and loan growth, largely offset by the consumer real estate portfolio due to continued portfolio improvement and increased home prices. included in the provision is an expense of $76 million related to the pci loan portfolio for 2017 compared to a benefit of $45 million in 2016.
the provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, decreased $360 million to $669 million in 2017 compared to 2016 driven by reductions in energy exposures, partially offset by a single-name non-u.s. commercial charge-off.
allowance for credit losses allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses is comprised of two components. the first component covers nonperforming commercial loans and tdrs. the second component covers loans and leases on which there are incurred losses that are not yet individually identifiable, as well as incurred losses that may not be represented in the loss forecast models. we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses based on the total of these two components, each of which is described in more detail below. the allowance for loan and lease losses excludes lhfs and loans accounted for under the fair value option as the fair value reflects a credit risk component.
the first component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers both nonperforming commercial loans and all tdrs within the consumer and commercial portfolios. these loans are subject to impairment measurement based on the present value of projected future cash flows discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate, or in certain circumstances, impairment may also be based upon the collateral value or the loan's observable market price if available. impairment measurement for the renegotiated consumer credit card, small business credit card and unsecured consumer tdr portfolios is based on the present value of projected cash flows discounted using the average portfolio contractual interest rate, excluding promotionally priced loans, in effect prior to restructuring. for purposes of computing this specific loss component of the allowance, larger impaired loans are evaluated individually and smaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool using historical experience for the respective product types and risk ratings of the loans.
the second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers the remaining consumer and commercial loans and leases that have incurred losses that are not yet individually identifiable. the allowance for consumer and certain homogeneous commercial loan and lease products is based on aggregated portfolio evaluations, generally by product type. loss forecast models are utilized that consider a variety of factors including, but not limited to, historical loss experience, estimated defaults or foreclosures based on portfolio trends, delinquencies, economic trends and credit scores. our consumer real estate loss forecast model estimates the portion of loans that will default based on individual loan attributes, the most significant of which are refreshed ltv or cltv, and borrower credit score as well as vintage and geography, all of which are further broken down into current delinquency status. additionally, we incorporate the delinquency status of underlying first-lien loans on our junior-lien home equity portfolio in our allowance process. incorporating refreshed ltv and cltv into our probability of default allows us to factor the impact of changes in home prices into our allowance for loan and lease losses. these loss forecast models are updated on a quarterly basis to incorporate information reflecting the current economic environment. as of december 31, 2017, the loss forecast process resulted in reductions in the allowance related to the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios compared to december 31, 2016.
the allowance for commercial loan and lease losses is established by product type after analyzing historical loss experience, internal risk rating, current economic conditions, industry performance trends, geographic and obligor concentrations within each portfolio and any other pertinent information. the statistical models for commercial loans are generally updated annually and utilize our historical database of actual defaults and other data, including external default data. the loan risk ratings and composition of the commercial portfolios used to calculate the allowance are updated quarterly to incorporate the most recent data reflecting the current economic environment. for risk-rated commercial loans, we estimate the probability of default and the loss given default (lgd) based on our historical experience of defaults and credit losses. factors considered when assessing the internal risk rating include the value of the underlying collateral, if applicable, the industry in which the obligor operates, the obligor's liquidity and other financial indicators, and other quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the obligor's credit risk. as of december 31, 2017, the allowance decreased for the u.s. commercial and non-u.s. commercial portfolios compared to december 31, 2016.
also included within the second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses are reserves to cover losses that are incurred but, in our assessment, may not be adequately represented in the historical loss data used in the loss forecast models. for example, factors that we consider include, among others, changes in lending policies and procedures, changes in economic and business conditions, changes in the nature and size of the portfolio, changes in portfolio concentrations, changes in the volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such as competition, and legal and regulatory requirements. we also consider factors that are applicable to unique portfolio segments. for example, we consider the risk of uncertainty in our loss forecasting models related to junior-lien home equity loans that are current, but have first-lien loans that we do not service that are 30 days or more past due. in addition, we consider the increased risk of default associated with our interest-only loans that have yet to enter the amortization period. further, we consider the inherent uncertainty in mathematical models that are built upon historical data.

during 2017, the factors that impacted the allowance for loan and lease losses included improvements in the credit quality of the consumer real estate portfolios driven by continuing improvements in the u.s. economy and labor markets, proactive credit risk management initiatives and the impact of high credit quality originations. evidencing the improvements in the u.s. economy and labor markets are downward unemployment trends and increases in home prices. in addition to these improvements, in the consumer portfolio, nonperforming consumer loans decreased $838 million in 2017 as returns to performing status, charge-offs, paydowns and loan sales continued to outpace new nonaccrual loans. during 2017, the allowance for loan and lease losses in the commercial portfolio reflected decreased energy reserves primarily driven by reductions in energy exposures including utilized reservable criticized exposures.
we monitor differences between estimated and actual incurred loan and lease losses. this monitoring process includes periodic assessments by senior management of loan and lease portfolios and the models used to estimate incurred losses in those portfolios.
the allowance for loan and lease losses for the consumer portfolio, as presented in table 48, was $5.4 billion at december 31, 2017, a decrease of $839 million from december 31, 2016. the decrease was primarily in the consumer real estate portfolio and the non-u.s. card portfolio which was sold in 2017, partially offset by an increase in the u.s. credit card portfolio. the reduction in the consumer real estate portfolio was due to improved home prices, lower nonperforming loans and a decrease in loan balances in our non-core portfolio. the increase in the u.s. credit card portfolio was driven by portfolio seasoning and loan growth.
the allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial portfolio, as presented in table 48, was $5.0 billion at december 31, 2017, a decrease of $248 million from december 31, 2016 driven by decreased energy reserves due to reductions in the higher risk energy sub-sectors. commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure decreased to $13.6 billion at december 31, 2017 from $16.3 billion (to 2.65 percent from 3.35 percent of total commercial utilized reservable exposure) at december 31, 2016, largely due to paydowns and net upgrades in the energy portfolio. nonperforming commercial loans decreased to $1.3
billion at december 31, 2017 from $1.7 billion (to 0.27 percent from 0.38 percent of outstanding commercial loans excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option) at december 31, 2016 with the decrease primarily in the energy and metal and mining sectors. see tables 34, 35 and 36 for more details on key commercial credit statistics.
the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was 1.12 percent at december 31, 2017 compared to 1.26 percent at december 31, 2016. the decrease in the ratio was primarily due to improved credit quality in the consumer real estate portfolio driven by improved economic conditions. the december 31, 2017 and 2016 ratios above include the pci loan portfolio. excluding the pci loan portfolio, the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was 1.10 percent and 1.24 percent at december 31, 2017 and 2016.
reserve for unfunded lending commitments in addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments such as letters of credit, financial guarantees, unfunded bankers' acceptances and binding loan commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option. unfunded lending commitments are subject to the same assessment as funded loans, including estimates of probability of default and lgd. due to the nature of unfunded commitments, the estimate of probable losses must also consider utilization. to estimate the portion of these undrawn commitments that is likely to be drawn by a borrower at the time of estimated default, analyses of our historical experience are applied to the unfunded commitments to estimate the funded exposure at default (ead). the expected loss for unfunded lending commitments is the product of the probability of default, the lgd and the ead, adjusted for any qualitative factors including economic uncertainty and inherent imprecision in models.
the reserve for unfunded lending commitments was $777 million at december 31, 2017 compared to $762 million at december 31, 2016.

market risk management market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions may adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities, or otherwise negatively impact earnings. this risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations, primarily within our global markets segment. we are also exposed to these risks in other areas of the corporation (e.g., our alm activities). in the event of market stress, these risks could have a material impact on our results. for more information, see interest rate risk management for the banking book on page 81.
our traditional banking loan and deposit products are non-trading positions and are generally reported at amortized cost for assets or the amount owed for liabilities (historical cost). however, these positions are still subject to changes in economic value based on varying market conditions, with one of the primary risks being changes in the levels of interest rates. the risk of adverse changes in the economic value of our non-trading positions arising from changes in interest rates is managed through our alm activities. we have elected to account for certain assets and liabilities under the fair value option.
our trading positions are reported at fair value with changes reflected in income. trading positions are subject to various changes in market-based risk factors. the majority of this risk is generated by our activities in the interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, equity and commodities markets. in addition, the values of assets and liabilities could change due to market liquidity, correlations across markets and expectations of market volatility. we seek to manage these risk exposures by using a variety of techniques that encompass a broad range of financial instruments. the key risk management techniques are discussed in more detail in the trading risk management section.
global risk management is responsible for providing senior management with a clear and comprehensive understanding of the trading risks to which we are exposed. these responsibilities include ownership of market risk policy, developing and maintaining quantitative risk models, calculating aggregated risk measures, establishing and monitoring position limits consistent with risk appetite, conducting daily reviews and analysis of trading inventory, approving material risk exposures and fulfilling regulatory requirements. market risks that impact businesses outside of global markets are monitored and governed by their respective governance functions.
quantitative risk models, such as var, are an essential component in evaluating the market risks within a portfolio. the enterprise model risk committee (emrc), a subcommittee of the mrc, is responsible for providing management oversight and approval of model risk management and governance. the emrc defines model risk standards, consistent with our risk framework and risk appetite, prevailing regulatory guidance and industry best practice. models must meet certain validation criteria, including effective challenge of the model development process and a sufficient demonstration of developmental evidence incorporating a comparison of alternative theories and approaches. the emrc oversees that model standards are consistent with model risk requirements and monitors the effective challenge in the model validation process across the corporation. in addition, the relevant stakeholders must agree on any required actions or restrictions to the models and maintain a stringent monitoring process for continued compliance.
interest rate risk interest rate risk represents exposures to instruments whose values vary with the level or volatility of interest rates. these instruments include, but are not limited to, loans, debt securities, certain trading-related assets and liabilities, deposits, borrowings and derivatives. hedging instruments used to mitigate these risks include derivatives such as options, futures, forwards and swaps.
bank of america 2017 76
foreign exchange risk foreign exchange risk represents exposures to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. the types of instruments exposed to this risk include investments in non-u.s. subsidiaries, foreign currency-denominated loans and securities, future cash flows in foreign currencies arising from foreign exchange transactions, foreign currency-denominated debt and various foreign exchange derivatives whose values fluctuate with changes in the level or volatility of currency exchange rates or non-u.s. interest rates. hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include foreign exchange options, currency swaps, futures, forwards, and foreign currency-denominated debt and deposits.
mortgage risk mortgage risk represents exposures to changes in the values of mortgage-related instruments. the values of these instruments are sensitive to prepayment rates, mortgage rates, agency debt ratings, default, market liquidity, government participation and interest rate volatility. our exposure to these instruments takes several forms. first, we trade and engage in market-making activities in a variety of mortgage securities including whole loans, pass-through certificates, commercial mortgages and collateralized mortgage obligations including collateralized debt obligations using mortgages as underlying collateral. second, we originate a variety of mbs which involves the accumulation of mortgage-related loans in anticipation of eventual securitization. third, we may hold positions in mortgage securities and residential mortgage loans as part of the alm portfolio. fourth, we create msrs as part of our mortgage origination activities. for more information on msrs, see note 1 - summary of significant accounting principles and note 20 - fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements. hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include derivatives such as options, swaps, futures and forwards as well as securities including mbs and u.s. treasury securities. for more information, see mortgage banking risk management on page 83.
equity market risk equity market risk represents exposures to securities that represent an ownership interest in a corporation in the form of domestic and foreign common stock or other equity-linked instruments. instruments that would lead to this exposure include, but are not limited to, the following: common stock, exchange-traded funds, american depositary receipts, convertible bonds, listed equity options (puts and calls), otc equity options, equity total return swaps, equity index futures and other equity derivative products. hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options, futures, swaps, convertible bonds and cash positions.
commodity risk commodity risk represents exposures to instruments traded in the petroleum, natural gas, power and metals markets. these instruments consist primarily of futures, forwards, swaps and options. hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options, futures and swaps in the same or similar commodity product, as well as cash positions.
issuer credit risk issuer credit risk represents exposures to changes in the creditworthiness of individual issuers or groups of issuers. our portfolio is exposed to issuer credit risk where the value of an asset may be adversely impacted by changes in the levels of credit spreads, by credit migration or by defaults. hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include bonds, cds and other credit fixed-income instruments.
market liquidity risk market liquidity risk represents the risk that the level of expected market activity changes dramatically and, in certain cases, may even cease. this exposes us to the risk that we will not be able to transact business and execute trades in an orderly manner which may impact our results. this impact could be further exacerbated if expected hedging or pricing correlations are compromised by disproportionate demand or lack of demand for certain instruments. we utilize various risk mitigating techniques as discussed in more detail in trading risk management.
trading risk management to evaluate risk in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions. various techniques and procedures are utilized to enable the most complete understanding of these risks. quantitative measures of market risk are evaluated on a daily basis from a single position to the portfolio of the corporation. these measures include sensitivities of positions to various market risk factors, such as the potential impact on revenue from a one basis point change in interest rates, and statistical measures utilizing both actual and hypothetical market moves, such as var and stress testing. periods of extreme market stress influence the reliability of these techniques to varying degrees. qualitative evaluations of market risk utilize the suite of quantitative risk measures while understanding each of their respective limitations. additionally, risk managers independently evaluate the risk of the portfolios under the current market environment and potential future environments.
var is a common statistic used to measure market risk as it allows the aggregation of market risk factors, including the effects of portfolio diversification. a var model simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. var represents the loss a portfolio is not expected to exceed more than a certain number of times per period, based on a specified holding period, confidence level and window of historical data. we use one var model consistently across the trading portfolios and it uses a historical simulation approach based on a three-year window of historical data. our primary var statistic is equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level. this means that for a var with a one-day holding period, there should not be losses in excess of var, on average, 99 out of 100 trading days.
within any var model, there are significant and numerous assumptions that will differ from company to company. the accuracy of a var model depends on the availability and quality of historical data for each of the risk factors in the portfolio. a var model may require additional modeling assumptions for new products that do not have the necessary historical market data or for less liquid positions for which accurate daily prices are not consistently available. for positions with insufficient historical data for the var calculation, the process for establishing an appropriate proxy is based on fundamental and statistical analysis of the new product or less liquid position. this analysis identifies reasonable alternatives that replicate both the expected volatility and correlation to other market risk factors that the missing data would be expected to experience.

var may not be indicative of realized revenue volatility as changes in market conditions or in the composition of the portfolio can have a material impact on the results. in particular, the historical data used for the var calculation might indicate higher or lower levels of portfolio diversification than will be experienced. in order for the var model to reflect current market conditions, we update the historical data underlying our var model on a weekly basis, or more frequently during periods of market stress, and regularly review the assumptions underlying the model. a minor portion of risks related to our trading positions is not included in var. these risks are reviewed as part of our icaap. for more information regarding icaap, see capital management on page 45.
global risk management continually reviews, evaluates and enhances our var model so that it reflects the material risks in our trading portfolio. changes to the var model are reviewed and approved prior to implementation and any material changes are reported to management through the appropriate management committees.
trading limits on quantitative risk measures, including var, are independently set by global markets risk management and reviewed on a regular basis so that trading limits remain relevant and within our overall risk appetite for market risks. trading limits are reviewed in the context of market liquidity, volatility and strategic business priorities. trading limits are set at both a granular level to allow for extensive coverage of risks as well as at aggregated portfolios to account for correlations among risk factors. all trading limits are approved at least annually. approved trading limits are stored and tracked in a centralized limits management system. trading limit excesses are communicated to management for review. certain quantitative market risk measures and corresponding limits have been identified as critical in the corporation's risk appetite statement. these risk appetite limits are reported on a daily basis and are approved at least annually by the erc and the board.
in periods of market stress, global markets senior leadership communicates daily to discuss losses, key risk positions and any limit excesses. as a result of this process, the businesses may selectively reduce risk.
table 49 presents the total market-based trading portfolio var which is the combination of the covered positions trading portfolio and the impact from less liquid trading exposures. covered positions are defined by regulatory standards as trading assets and liabilities, both on- and off-balance sheet, that meet a defined set of specifications. these specifications identify the most liquid trading positions which are intended to be held for a short-term horizon and where we are able to hedge the material risk elements in a two-way market. positions in less liquid markets, or where there are restrictions on the ability to trade the positions, typically do not qualify as covered positions. foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions, except for structural foreign currency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory approval. in addition, table 49 presents our fair value option portfolio, which includes substantially all of the funded and unfunded exposures for which we elect the fair value option, and their corresponding hedges. the fair value option portfolio combined with the total market-based trading portfolio var represents our total market-based portfolio var. additionally, market risk var for trading activities as presented in table 49 differs from var used for regulatory capital calculations due to the holding period being used. the holding period for var used for regulatory capital calculations is 10 days, while for the market risk var presented below it is one day. both measures utilize the same process and methodology.
the total market-based portfolio var results in table 49 include market risk to which we are exposed from all business segments, excluding cva and dva. the majority of this portfolio is within the global markets segment.
table 49 presents year-end, average, high and low daily trading var for 2017 and 2016 using a 99 percent confidence level.

additional var statistics produced within our single var model are provided in table 50 at the same level of detail as in table 49. evaluating var with additional statistics allows for an increased understanding of the risks in the portfolio as the historical market data used in the var calculation does not necessarily follow a predefined statistical distribution. table 50 presents average trading var statistics at 99 percent and 95 percent confidence levels for 2017 and 2016.

backtesting the accuracy of the var methodology is evaluated by backtesting, which compares the daily var results, utilizing a one-day holding period, against a comparable subset of trading revenue. a backtesting excess occurs when a trading loss exceeds the var for the corresponding day. these excesses are evaluated to understand the positions and market moves that produced the trading loss and to assess whether the var methodology accurately represents those losses. we expect the frequency of trading losses in excess of var to be in line with the confidence level of the var statistic being tested. for example, with a 99 percent confidence level, we expect one trading loss in excess of var every 100 days or between two to three trading losses in excess of var over the course of a year. the number of backtesting excesses observed can differ from the statistically expected number of excesses if the current level of market volatility is materially different than the level of market volatility that existed during the three years of historical data used in the var calculation.
the trading revenue used for backtesting is defined by regulatory agencies in order to most closely align with the var component of the regulatory capital calculation. this revenue differs from total trading-related revenue in that it excludes revenue from trading activities that either do not generate market risk or the market risk cannot be included in var. some examples of the types of revenue excluded for backtesting are fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income and intraday trading revenues.
we conduct daily backtesting on our portfolios, ranging from the total market-based portfolio to individual trading areas. additionally, we conduct daily backtesting on the var results used for regulatory capital calculations as well as the var results for key legal entities, regions and risk factors. these results are reported to senior market risk management. senior management regularly reviews and evaluates the results of these tests.
during 2017, there were no days in which there was a backtesting excess for our total market-based portfolio var, utilizing a one-day holding period.

total trading-related revenue total trading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, and cva, dva and funding valuation adjustment gains (losses), represents the total amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. trading account assets and liabilities are reported at fair value. for more information on fair value, see note 20 - fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements. trading-related revenue can be volatile and is largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. also, trading-related revenue is dependent on the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever-changing market environment. significant daily revenue by business is monitored and the primary drivers of these are reviewed.
the following histogram is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for 2017 and 2016. during 2017, positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 100 percent of the trading days, of which 77 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. this compares to 2016 where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 99 percent of the trading days, of which 84 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million and the largest loss was $24 million.
trading portfolio stress testing because the very nature of a var model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical window, we also stress test our portfolio using scenario analysis. this analysis estimates the change in the value of our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements.
a set of scenarios, categorized as either historical or hypothetical, are computed daily for the overall trading portfolio and individual businesses. these scenarios include shocks to underlying market risk factors that may be well beyond the shocks found in the historical data used to calculate var. historical scenarios simulate the impact of the market moves that occurred during a period of extended historical market stress. generally, a multi-week period representing the most severe point during a crisis is selected for each historical scenario. hypothetical scenarios provide estimated portfolio impacts from potential future market stress events. scenarios are reviewed and updated in response to changing positions and new economic or political information. in addition, new or ad hoc scenarios are developed to address specific potential market events or particular vulnerabilities in the portfolio. the stress tests are reviewed on a regular basis and the results are presented to senior management.
stress testing for the trading portfolio is integrated with enterprise-wide stress testing and incorporated into the limits framework. the macroeconomic scenarios used for enterprise-wide stress testing purposes differ from the typical trading portfolio scenarios in that they have a longer time horizon and the results are forecasted over multiple periods for use in consolidated capital and liquidity planning. for more information, see managing risk on page 41.

interest rate risk management for the banking book the following discussion presents net interest income for banking book activities.
interest rate risk represents the most significant market risk exposure to our banking book balance sheet. interest rate risk is measured as the potential change in net interest income caused by movements in market interest rates. client-facing activities, primarily lending and deposit-taking, create interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet.
we prepare forward-looking forecasts of net interest income. the baseline forecast takes into consideration expected future business growth, alm positioning and the direction of interest rate movements as implied by the market-based forward curve. we then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative interest rate scenarios have on the baseline forecast in order to assess interest rate sensitivity under varied conditions. the net interest income forecast is frequently updated for changing assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends, market conditions and business strategies. thus, we continually monitor our balance sheet position in order to maintain an acceptable level of exposure to interest rate changes.
the interest rate scenarios that we analyze incorporate balance sheet assumptions such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, changes in funding mix, product repricing, maturity characteristics and investment securities premium amortization. our overall goal is to manage interest rate risk so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital.

during 2017, the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet to rising rates was largely unchanged. we continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel move in interest rates with the majority of that benefit coming from the short end of the yield curve. additionally, higher interest rates impact the fair value of debt securities and, accordingly, for debt securities classified as available for sale (afs), may adversely affect accumulated oci and thus capital levels under the basel 3 capital rules. under instantaneous upward parallel shifts, the near-term adverse impact to basel 3 capital is reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income. for more information on basel 3, see capital management - regulatory capital on page 45.

the sensitivity analysis in table 52 assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates. as part of our alm activities, we use securities, certain residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity.
the behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income. the sensitivity analysis in table 52 assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments. in higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher-yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce our benefit in those scenarios.
interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are utilized in our alm activities and serve as an efficient tool to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk. we use derivatives to hedge the variability in cash flows or changes in fair value on our balance sheet due to interest rate and foreign exchange components. for more information on our hedging activities, see note 2 - derivatives to the consolidated financial statements.
our interest rate contracts are generally non-leveraged generic interest rate and foreign exchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards. in addition, we use foreign exchange contracts, including cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign currency futures contracts, foreign currency forward contracts and options to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities.
changes to the composition of our derivatives portfolio during 2017 reflect actions taken for interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk management. the decisions to reposition our derivatives portfolio are based on the current assessment of economic and financial conditions including the interest rate and foreign currency environments, balance sheet composition and trends, and the relative mix of our cash and derivative positions.

we use interest rate derivative instruments to hedge the variability in the cash flows of our assets and liabilities and other forecasted transactions (collectively referred to as cash flow hedges). the net losses on both open and terminated cash flow hedge derivative instruments recorded in accumulated oci were $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion, on a pre-tax basis, at december 31, 2017 and 2016. these net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the same period as the hedged cash flows affect earnings and will decrease income or increase expense on the respective hedged cash flows. assuming no change in open cash flow derivative hedge positions and no changes in prices or interest rates beyond what is implied in forward yield curves at december 31, 2017, the pre-tax net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings as follows: $208 million, or 16 percent, within the next year, 56 percent in years two through five, and 18 percent in years six through 10, with the remaining 10 percent thereafter. for more information on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, see note 2 - derivatives to the consolidated financial statements.
we hedge our net investment in non-u.s. operations determined to have functional currencies other than the u.s. dollar using forward foreign exchange contracts that typically settle in less than 180 days, cross-currency basis swaps and foreign exchange options. we recorded net after-tax losses on derivatives in accumulated oci associated with net investment hedges which were offset by gains on our net investments in consolidated non-u.s. entities at december 31, 2017.
mortgage banking risk management we originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. we determine whether loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate.
interest rate risk and market risk can be substantial in the mortgage business. changes in interest rates and other market factors impact the volume of mortgage originations. changes in interest rates also impact the value of irlcs and the related residential first mortgage lhfs between the date of the irlc and the date the loans are sold to the secondary market. an increase in mortgage interest rates typically leads to a decrease in the value of these instruments. conversely, the value of the msrs will increase driven by lower prepayment expectations when there is an increase in interest rates. because the interest rate risks of these two hedged items offset, we combine them into one overall hedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio consisting of derivative contracts and securities.
during 2017 and 2016, we recorded gains in mortgage banking income of $118 million and $366 million related to the change in fair value of the msrs, irlcs and lhfs, net of gains and losses on the hedge portfolio. for more information on msrs, see note 20 - fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements and for more information on mortgage banking income, see consumer banking on page 31.
compliance risk management compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or damage to the reputation of the corporation arising from the failure of the corporation to comply with the requirements of applicable laws, rules, regulations and related self-regulatory organizations' standards and codes of conduct (collectively, applicable laws, rules and regulations). global compliance independently assesses compliance risk, and evaluates flus and control functions for adherence to applicable laws, rules and regulations, including identifying compliance issues and risks, performing monitoring and developing tests to be conducted by the enterprise independent testing unit, and reporting on the state of compliance activities across the corporation. enterprise independent testing, an independent testing function within irm, works with global compliance, the flus and control functions in the identification of testing needs and test design, and is accountable for test execution, reporting and analysis of results. additionally, global compliance works with flus and control functions so that day-to-day activities operate in a compliant manner.
the corporation's approach to the management of compliance risk is described in the global compliance - enterprise policy, which outlines the requirements of the corporation's global compliance program, and defines roles and responsibilities of flus, irm and corporate audit, the three lines of defense in managing compliance risk. the requirements work together to drive a comprehensive risk-based approach for the proactive identification, management and escalation of compliance risks throughout the corporation. for more information on flus and control functions, see managing risk on page 41.
the global compliance - enterprise policy also sets the requirements for reporting compliance risk information to executive management as well as the board or appropriate board-level committees in support of global compliance's responsibility for conducting independent oversight of the corporation's compliance risk management activities. the board provides oversight of compliance risk through its audit committee and the erc.
operational risk management operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. operational risk may occur anywhere in the corporation, including third-party business processes, and is not limited to operations functions. effects may extend beyond financial losses and may result in reputational risk impacts. operational risk includes legal risk. additionally, operational risk is a component in the calculation of total risk-weighted assets used in the basel 3 capital calculation. for more information on basel 3 calculations, see capital management on page 45.
the corporation's approach to operational risk management is outlined in the operational risk - enterprise policy, and supporting standards which establish the requirements and accountabilities for managing operational risk through a comprehensive set of integrated practices implemented by the corporation so that our business processes are designed and executed effectively. the operational risk - enterprise policy is the basis for the operational risk management program.
the operational risk management program describes the processes for identifying, measuring, monitoring, controlling and reporting operational risk information to executive management, as well as the board or appropriate board-level committees. under the operational risk management program, flus and control functions are responsible for identifying, escalating and debating risk associated with their business activities. the operational risk management teams independently monitor and assess processes and controls, and develop tests to be conducted by the enterprise independent testing unit to validate that processes are operating as intended. the requirements work together to drive a comprehensive risk-based approach for the proactive identification, management and escalation of operational risks throughout the corporation.

the mrc oversees the corporation's policies and processes for operational risk management and serves as an escalation point for critical operational risk matters with the corporation. the mrc reports operational risk activities to the erc of the board.
reputational risk management reputational risk is the risk that negative perceptions of the corporation's conduct or business practices may adversely impact its profitability or operations. reputational risk may result from many of the corporation's activities, including those related to the management of our strategic, operational, compliance and credit risks.
the corporation manages reputational risk through established policies and controls in its businesses and risk management processes to mitigate reputational risks in a timely manner and through proactive monitoring and identification of potential reputational risk events. the corporation has processes and procedures in place to respond to events that give rise to reputational risk, including educating individuals and organizations that influence public opinion, implementing external communication strategies to mitigate the risk, and informing key stakeholders of potential reputational risks.
the corporation's organization and governance structure provides oversight of reputational risks, and reputational risk reporting is provided regularly and directly to management and the erc, which provides primary oversight of reputational risk. in addition, each flu has a committee, which includes representatives from compliance, legal and risk, that is responsible for the oversight of reputational risk. such committees' oversight includes providing approval for business activities that present elevated levels of reputational risks.
complex accounting estimates our significant accounting principles, as described in note 1 - summary of significant accounting principles to the consolidated financial statements, are essential in understanding the md&a. many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. we have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments.
the more judgmental estimates are summarized in the following discussion. we have identified and described the development of the variables most important in the estimation processes that involve mathematical models to derive the estimates. in many cases, there are numerous alternative judgments that could be used in the process of determining the inputs to the models. where alternatives exist, we have used the factors that we believe represent the most reasonable value in developing the inputs. actual performance that differs from our estimates of the key variables could impact our results of operations. separate from the possible future impact to our results of operations from input and model variables, the value of our lending portfolio and market-sensitive assets and liabilities may change subsequent to the balance sheet date, often significantly, due to the nature and magnitude of future credit and market conditions. such credit and market conditions may change quickly and in unforeseen ways and the resulting volatility could have a significant, negative effect on future operating results.
these fluctuations would not be indicative of deficiencies in our models or inputs.
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, represents management's estimate of probable losses inherent in the corporation's loan portfolio excluding those loans accounted for under the fair value option. our process for determining the allowance for credit losses is discussed in note 1 - summary of significant accounting principles to the consolidated financial statements.
our estimate for the allowance for loan and lease losses is sensitive to the loss rates and expected cash flows from our consumer real estate and credit card and other consumer portfolio segments, as well as our u.s. small business commercial card portfolio within the commercial portfolio segment. for each one-percent increase in the loss rates on loans collectively evaluated for impairment in our consumer real estate portfolio segment, excluding pci loans, coupled with a one-percent decrease in the discounted cash flows on those loans individually evaluated for impairment within this portfolio segment, the allowance for loan and lease losses at december 31, 2017 would have increased $36 million. we subject our pci portfolio to stress scenarios to evaluate the potential impact given certain events. a one-percent decrease in the expected cash flows could result in a $99 million impairment of the portfolio. within our credit card and other consumer portfolio segment and u.s. small business commercial card portfolio, for each one-percent increase in the loss rates on loans collectively evaluated for impairment coupled with a one-percent decrease in the expected cash flows on those loans individually evaluated for impairment, the allowance for loan and lease losses at december 31, 2017 would have increased $41 million.
our allowance for loan and lease losses is sensitive to the risk ratings assigned to loans and leases within the commercial portfolio segment (excluding the u.s. small business commercial card portfolio). assuming a downgrade of one level in the internal risk ratings for commercial loans and leases, except loans and leases already risk-rated doubtful as defined by regulatory authorities, the allowance for loan and lease losses would have increased $2.6 billion at december 31, 2017.
the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases at december 31, 2017 was 1.12 percent and these hypothetical increases in the allowance would raise the ratio to 1.41 percent.
these sensitivity analyses do not represent management's expectations of the deterioration in risk ratings or the increases in loss rates but are provided as hypothetical scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the allowance for loan and lease losses to changes in key inputs. we believe the risk ratings and loss severities currently in use are appropriate and that the probability of the alternative scenarios outlined above occurring within a short period of time is remote.
the process of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses requires a high degree of judgment. it is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions.

fair value of financial instruments we are, under applicable accounting standards, required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value. we classify fair value measurements of financial instruments and msrs based on the three-level fair value hierarchy in the accounting standards.
the fair values of assets and liabilities may include adjustments, such as market liquidity and credit quality, where appropriate. valuations of products using models or other techniques are sensitive to assumptions used for the significant inputs. where market data is available, the inputs used for valuation reflect that information as of our valuation date. inputs to valuation models are considered unobservable if they are supported by little or no market activity. in periods of extreme volatility, lessened liquidity or in illiquid markets, there may be more variability in market pricing or a lack of market data to use in the valuation process. in keeping with the prudent application of estimates and management judgment in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities, we have in place various processes and controls that include: a model validation policy that requires review and approval of quantitative models used for deal pricing, financial statement fair value determination and risk quantification; a trading product valuation policy that requires verification of all traded product valuations; and a periodic review and substantiation of daily profit and loss reporting for all traded products. primarily through validation controls, we utilize both broker and pricing service inputs which can and do include both market-observable and internally-modeled values and/or valuation inputs. our reliance on this information is affected by our understanding of how the broker and/or pricing service develops its data with a higher degree of reliance applied to those that are more directly observable and lesser reliance applied to those developed through their own internal modeling. similarly, broker quotes that are executable are given a higher level of reliance than indicative broker quotes, which are not executable. these processes and controls are performed independently of the business. for more information, see note 20 - fair value measurements and note 21 - fair value option to the consolidated financial statements.
level 3 assets and liabilities financial assets and liabilities, and msrs, where values are based on valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and are significant to the overall fair value measurement are classified as level 3 under the fair value hierarchy established in applicable accounting standards. the fair value of these level 3 financial assets and liabilities and msrs is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. total recurring level 3 assets were $12.9 billion, or 0.57 percent of total assets, and total recurring level 3 liabilities were $7.7 billion, or 0.38 percent of total liabilities, at december 31, 2017 compared to $14.5 billion or 0.66 percent and $7.2 billion or 0.37 percent at december 31, 2016.
level 3 financial instruments may be hedged with derivatives classified as level 1 or 2; therefore, gains or losses associated with level 3 financial instruments may be offset by gains or losses associated with financial instruments classified in other levels of the fair value hierarchy. the level 3 gains and losses recorded in earnings did not have a significant impact on our liquidity or capital. we conduct a review of our fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. transfers into or out of level 3 are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities became unobservable or observable, respectively, in the current marketplace. these transfers are considered to be effective as of the beginning of the quarter in which they occur. for more information on the significant transfers into and out of level 3 during 2017 and 2016, see note 20 - fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements.
accrued income taxes and deferred tax assets accrued income taxes, reported as a component of either other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet, represent the net amount of current income taxes we expect to pay to or receive from various taxing jurisdictions attributable to our operations to date. we currently file income tax returns in more than 100 federal, state and non-u.s. jurisdictions and consider many factors, including statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance, in estimating the appropriate accrued income taxes for each jurisdiction.
net deferred tax assets, reported as a component of other assets on the consolidated balance sheet, represent the net decrease in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of net operating loss (nol) and tax credit carryforwards and because of future reversals of temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and their bases as reported in the financial statements. nol and tax credit carryforwards result in reductions to future tax liabilities, and many of these attributes can expire if not utilized within certain periods. we consider the need for valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amounts that we estimate are more-likely-than-not to be realized.
consistent with the applicable accounting standards, we monitor relevant tax authorities and change our estimates of accrued income taxes and/or net deferred tax assets due to changes in income tax laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities. these revisions of our estimates, which also may result from our income tax planning and from the resolution of income tax audit matters, may be material to our operating results for any given period.
on december 22, 2017, the president signed into law the tax act which made significant changes to federal income tax law including, among other things, reducing the statutory corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent and changing the taxation of our non-u.s. business activities. on that same date, the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no. 118, which specifies, among other things, that reasonable estimates of the income tax effects of the tax act should be used, if determinable. we have accounted for the effects of the tax act using reasonable estimates based on currently available information and our interpretations thereof. this accounting may change due to, among other things, changes in interpretations we have made and the issuance of new tax or accounting guidance.
see note 19 - income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. for more information, see item 1a. risk factors - regulatory, compliance, and legal.
goodwill and intangible assets the nature of and accounting for goodwill and intangible assets are discussed in note 1 - summary of significant accounting principles and note 8 - goodwill and intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements. goodwill is reviewed for potential impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis, which for the corporation is as of june 30, and in interim periods if events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment. a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below.
85 bank of america 2017
we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of june 30, 2017 for all of our reporting units that had goodwill. in performing that test, we compared the fair value of each reporting unit to its estimated carrying value as measured by allocated equity, which includes goodwill. to determine fair value, we utilized a combination of valuation techniques, consistent with the market approach and the income approach, and also utilized independent valuation specialists.
under the market approach we estimated the fair value of the individual reporting units utilizing various market multiples from comparable publicly-traded companies in industries similar to the reporting unit, including the application of a control premium of 30 percent, based upon observed comparable premiums paid for change-in-control transactions for financial institutions.
under the income approach, we estimated the fair value of the individual reporting units based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows, utilizing internal forecasts, and an appropriate terminal value. discount rates used ranged from 8.9 to 13.3 percent and were derived from a capital asset pricing model (i.e., cost of equity financing) that we believe adequately reflects the risk and uncertainty specifically in our internally-developed forecasts, the financial markets generally and industries similar to each of the reporting units. cumulative average growth rates developed by management for revenues and expenses in each reporting unit ranged from zero to 5.1 percent.
a prolonged decrease in a particular assumption could eventually lead to the fair value of a reporting unit being less than its carrying value.
based on the results of the test, we determined that the fair value exceeded the carrying value for all reporting units that had goodwill, indicating there was no impairment.
representations and warranties liability the methodology used to estimate the liability for obligations under representations and warranties related to transfers of residential mortgage loans considers, among other things, the repurchase experience implied in prior settlements, and adjusts the experience implied by those prior settlements based on the characteristics of those trusts where the corporation has a continuing possibility of timely claims. the estimate of the liability for obligations under representations and warranties is based upon currently available information, significant judgment, and a number of factors, including those set forth above, that are subject to change. changes to any one of these factors could significantly impact the estimate of our liability.
the estimate of the liability for representations and warranties is sensitive to future defaults, loss severity and the net repurchase rate. an assumed simultaneous increase or decrease of 10 percent in estimated future defaults, loss severity and the net repurchase rate would result in an increase of approximately $250 million or decrease of approximately $200 million in the representations and warranties liability as of december 31, 2017. these sensitivities are hypothetical and are intended to provide an indication of the impact of a significant change in these key assumptions on the representations and warranties liability. in reality, changes in one assumption may result in changes in other assumptions, which may or may not counteract the sensitivity.
for more information on representations and warranties exposure and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss, see off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations - representations and warranties on page 40, as well as note 7 - representations and warranties obligations and corporate guarantees and note 12 - commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements.
2016 compared to 2015
the following discussion and analysis provide a comparison of our results of operations for 2016 and 2015. this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes.
overview net income net income was $17.8 billion, or $1.49 per diluted share in 2016 compared to $15.9 billion, or $1.31 per diluted share in 2015. the results for 2016 compared to 2015 were driven by higher net interest income and lower noninterest expense, partially offset by a decline in noninterest income and higher provision for credit losses.
net interest income net interest income increased $2.1 billion to $41.1 billion in 2016 compared to 2015. the net interest yield increased seven bps to 2.21 percent for 2016. these increases were primarily driven by growth in commercial loans, the impact of higher short-end interest rates and increased debt securities balances, as well as a charge of $612 million in 2015 related to the redemption of certain trust preferred securities, partially offset by lower loan spreads and market-related hedge ineffectiveness.
noninterest income noninterest income decreased $1.4 billion to $42.6 billion in 2016 compared to 2015. the following highlights the significant changes.
●   service charges increased $257 million primarily due to higher treasury-related revenue.
●   investment and brokerage services income decreased $592 million driven by lower transactional revenue, and decreased asset management fees due to lower market valuations, partially offset by the impact of higher long-term aum flows.
●   investment banking income decreased $331 million driven by lower equity issuance fees and advisory fees due to a decline in market fee pools.
●   trading account profits increased $429 million due to a stronger performance across credit products led by mortgages, and continued strength in rates products, partially offset by reduced client activity in equities.
●   mortgage banking income decreased $511 million primarily driven by a decline in production income, higher representations and warranties provision and lower servicing income, partially offset by more favorable msr results, net of the related hedge performance.
●   gains on sales of debt securities decreased $648 million primarily driven by lower sales volume.
●   other income increased $102 million primarily due to lower dva losses on structured liabilities, improved results from loans and the related hedging activities in the fair value option portfolio and lower payment protection insurance expense, partially offset by lower gains on asset sales. dva losses related to structured liabilities were $97 million in 2015 compared to $633 million in 2015.
provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses increased $436 million to $3.6 billion for 2016 compared to 2015. the provision for credit losses was $224 million lower than net charge-offs for 2016, resulting in a reduction in the allowance for credit losses. this compared to a reduction of $1.2 billion in the allowance for credit losses in 2015.
bank of america 2017 86
the provision for credit losses for the consumer portfolio increased $360 million to $2.6 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 due to a slower pace of credit quality improvement. included in the provision is a benefit of $45 million related to the pci loan portfolio for 2016 compared to a benefit of $40 million in 2015. the provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, increased $76 million to $1.0 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 driven by an increase in energy sector reserves in the first half of 2016 for the higher risk energy sub-sectors. while we experienced some deterioration in the energy sector in 2016, oil prices stabilized which contributed to a modest improvement in energy-related exposure by year end.
noninterest expense noninterest expense decreased $2.5 billion to $55.1 billion for 2016 compared to 2015. personnel expense decreased $1.0 billion as we continued to manage headcount and achieve cost savings. continued expense management, as well as the expiration of advisor retention awards, more than offset the increases in client-facing professionals. professional fees decreased $293 million primarily due to lower legal fees. other general operating expense decreased $655 million primarily driven by lower foreclosed properties expense and lower brokerage fees, partially offset by higher fdic expense.
income tax expense the income tax expense was $7.2 billion on pretax income of $25.0 billion in 2016 compared to tax expense of $6.3 billion on pre-tax income of $22.2 billion in 2015. the effective tax rate for 2016 was 28.8 percent and was driven by our recurring tax preferences and net tax benefits related to various tax audit matters, partially offset by a $348 million charge for the impact of the u.k. tax law changes discussed below. the effective tax rate for 2015 was 28.3 percent and was driven by our recurring tax preferences and by tax benefits related to certain non-u.s. restructurings, partially offset by a charge for the impact of the u.k. tax law change enacted in 2015. the charge recorded in both years for the reduction in the u.k. corporate income tax rate was the result of remeasuring our u.k. net deferred tax assets using the lower tax rate.
business segment operations consumer banking net income for consumer banking increased $523 million to $7.2 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily driven by lower noninterest expense and higher revenue, partially offset by higher provision for credit losses. net interest income increased $862 million to $21.3 billion primarily due to the beneficial impact of an increase in investable assets as a result of higher deposits. noninterest income decreased $650 million to $10.4 billion due to lower mortgage banking income and gains in 2015 on certain divestitures. the provision for credit losses increased $369 million to $2.7 billion in 2016 primarily driven by a slower pace of improvement in the credit card portfolio. noninterest expense decreased $1.1 billion to $17.7 billion driven by improved operating efficiencies and lower fraud costs, partially offset by higher fdic expense.
global wealth & investment management net income for gwim increased $205 million to $2.8 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 driven by a decrease in noninterest expense, partially offset by a decrease in revenue. net interest income increased $232 million to $5.8 billion driven by the impact of growth in loan and deposit balances. noninterest income, which primarily includes investment and brokerage services income, decreased $616 million to $11.9 billion. the decline in noninterest income was driven by lower transactional revenue and decreased asset management fees primarily due to lower market valuations in 2016, partially offset by the impact of long-term aum flows. noninterest expense decreased $763 million to $13.2 billion primarily due to the expiration of advisor retention awards, lower revenue-related incentives and lower operating and support costs, partially offset by higher fdic expense.
global banking net income for global banking increased $390 million to $5.7 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 as higher revenue more than offset an increase in the provision for credit losses. revenue increased $824 million to $18.4 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 driven by higher net interest income, which increased $227 million to $9.5 billion driven by the impact of growth in loans and leases and higher deposits. noninterest income increased $597 million to $9.0 billion primarily due to the impact from loans and the related loan hedging activities in the fair value option portfolio and higher treasury-related revenues, partially offset by lower investment banking fees. the provision for credit losses increased $197 million to $883 million in 2016 driven by increases in energy-related reserves as well as loan growth. noninterest expense of $8.5 billion remained relatively unchanged in 2016 as investments in client-facing professionals in commercial and business banking, higher severance costs and an increase in fdic expense were largely offset by lower operating and support costs.
global markets net income for global markets increased $1.4 billion to $3.8 billion in 2016 compared to 2015. net dva losses were $238 million compared to losses of $786 million in 2015. excluding net dva, net income increased $1.1 billion to $4.0 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily driven by higher sales and trading revenue and lower noninterest expense, partially offset by lower investment banking fees and investment and brokerage services revenue. sales and trading revenue, excluding net dva, increased $638 million primarily due to a stronger performance globally across credit products led by mortgages and continued strength in rates products. the increase was partially offset by challenging credit market conditions in early 2016 as well as reduced client activity in equities, most notably in asia, and a less favorable trading environment for equity derivatives. noninterest expense decreased $1.2 billion to $10.2 billion primarily due to lower litigation expense and lower revenue-related expenses.
all other the net loss for all other increased $601 million to $1.7 billion in 2016 primarily due to lower gains on the sale of debt securities, lower mortgage banking income, lower gains on sales of consumer real estate loans and an increase in noninterest expense, partially offset by an improvement in the provision for credit losses. mortgage banking income decreased $133 million primarily due to higher representations and warranties provision, partially offset by more favorable net msr results. gains on the sales of loans were $232 million in 2016 compared to gains of $1.0 billion in 2015. the benefit in the provision for credit losses improved $79 million to a benefit of $100 million in 2016 primarily driven by lower loan and lease balances from continued run-off of non-core consumer real estate loans. noninterest expense increased $486 million to $5.6 billion driven by litigation expense.

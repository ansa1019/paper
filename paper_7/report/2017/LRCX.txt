executive summary lam research has been an innovative supplier of wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry for more than 35 years. our vision is to realize full value from natural technology extensions of our company. our customer base includes leading semiconductor memory, foundry, and idms that make products such as nvm, dram memory, and logic devices. we aim to increase our strategic relevance with our customers by contributing more to their continued success. our core technical competency is integrating hardware, process, materials, software, and process control enabling results on the wafer.
our products and services are designed to help our customers build smaller, faster, and better performing devices that are used in a variety of electronic products, including mobile phones, personal computers, servers, wearables, automotive devices, storage devices, and networking equipment.
semiconductor manufacturing, our customers' business, involves the complete fabrication of multiple dies or integrated circuits on a wafer. this involves the repetition of a set of core processes and can require hundreds of individual steps. fabricating these devices requires highly sophisticated process technologies to integrate an increasing array of new materials with precise control at the atomic scale. along with meeting technical requirements, wafer processing equipment must deliver high productivity and be cost-effective.
demand from the cloud, iot, and other markets is driving the need for increasingly powerful and cost-efficient semiconductors. at the same time, there are growing technical challenges with traditional two-dimensional scaling. these trends are driving significant inflections in semiconductor manufacturing, such as the increasing importance of vertical scaling strategies like 3d architectures as well as multiple patterning to enable shrinks.
we believe we are in an strong position with our leadership and competency in deposition, etch, and single-wafer clean to facilitate some of the most significant innovations in semiconductor device manufacturing. several factors create opportunity for sustainable differentiation for us: our focus on research and development, with a breadth of programs across sustaining engineering, product and process development, and concept and feasibility; our ability to effectively leverage cycles of learning from our broad installed base; and our collaborative focus with ecosystem partners.
during the most recent fiscal year, demand for our products improved as semiconductor device manufacturers, particularly non volatile memory and foundry customers, made capacity and technology investments. technology inflections in our industry, including nvm, multiple patterning, finfet and advanced packaging have led to an increase in our served addressable market for our products in deposition, etch, single-wafer clean and customer service business. we believe that demand for our products and services should increase faster than overall spending on wafer fabrication equipment, as the proportion of customers' capital expenditures rises in these technology inflection areas, and we continue to gain market share.
in october 2015, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger and reorganization with kla-tencor. on october 5, 2016, we announced that the parties mutually agreed to terminate that agreement.

interest income increased in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal years 2016 and 2015 primarily as a result of higher average cash and investment balances, as well as higher yield.
the decrease in interest expense during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to the retirement of the 2016 convertible note. the increase in interest expense during fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to the $1.0 billion senior note issuance in march 2015, combined with the note issuance cost amortization related to the october 2015 bridge financing arrangement.
the gain on deferred compensation plan related assets, in fiscal year 2017, compared to a loss in fiscal year 2016 and gain in fiscal year 2015 was driven by a rally in the fair market value of the underlying funds at year end.
loss on extinguishment of debt during fiscal year 2017 related to the special mandatory redemption of our 2023 and 2026 notes, as well as the termination of the amended and restated term loan agreement following the termination of the agreement and plan of merger and reorganization with kla-tencor.

the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to the change in the mix of income offset by the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits.
the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to the tax benefit of the altera court ruling (discussed in more detail below), higher income in lower tax jurisdictions, and an increased federal tax benefit due to a retroactive and permanent extension of federal research and development tax credit in fiscal year 2016.
in july 2015, the u.s. tax court (the "court") issued an opinion favorable to altera corporation ("altera") with respect to altera's litigation with the internal revenue service ("irs"). the litigation relates to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement with altera's foreign subsidiary. in its opinion, the court accepted altera's position of excluding stock-based compensation from its intercompany cost-sharing arrangement. however, the u.s. department of the treasury has not withdrawn the requirement to include stock-based compensation from its regulations. we have evaluated the opinion and as a result of such evaluation have recorded a tax benefit of $88 million related to reimbursement of cost share payments for the previously shared stock-based compensation costs. we have also recorded a tax benefit of $11 million related to stock-based compensation expense. in addition, we have recorded a tax liability of $74 million for the u.s. tax cost of potential repatriation of the associated contingent foreign earnings because at this time we cannot reasonably conclude that we have the ability and the intent to indefinitely reinvest these contingent earnings. we will continue to monitor this matter and related potential impacts to our consolidated financial statements.
international revenues account for a significant portion of our total revenues, such that a material portion of our pre-tax income is earned and taxed outside the united states at rates that are generally lower than in the united states. please refer to note 6 of our consolidated financial statements.
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. our gross deferred tax assets were $546 million and $465 million at the end of fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. these gross deferred tax assets were offset by gross deferred tax liabilities of $585 million and $429 million at the end of fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively, and a valuation allowance of $114 million and $102 million at the end of fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. the change in the gross deferred tax assets, gross deferred tax liabilities, and valuation allowance between fiscal year 2017 and 2016 is primarily due to an increase related to allowances and reserves and an increase in deferred tax liabilities related to an accrual for future tax liabilities due to the expected repatriation of foreign earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries.
as of our fiscal year end of june 25, 2017, we continue to record a valuation allowance to offset the entire california deferred tax asset balance due to the single sales factor apportionment election resulting in lower taxable income in california. we also recorded a valuation allowance on certain state tax credits and continue to record valuation allowances on certain foreign entities' net operating losses. the valuation allowances were $114 million and $102 million at the end of fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively.
we evaluate if the deferred tax assets are realizable on a quarterly basis and will continue to assess the need for changes in valuation allowances, if any.
continues on next page lam research corporation 2017 10-k 37
uncertain tax positions we re-evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. this evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, and effectively settled issues under audit. such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.
critical accounting policies and estimates a critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, complex and/or subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") requires management to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions. actual results could differ significantly from those estimates, which could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. our critical accounting estimates include:
•   the recognition and valuation of revenue from multiple-element arrangements, which impacts revenue;
•   the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross margin;
•   the valuation of warranty reserves, which impacts gross margin;
•   the valuation of equity-based compensation expense, including forfeiture estimates, which impacts both gross margin and operating expenses;
•   the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes, including the measurement of uncertain tax positions, which impact our provision for income tax expenses; and
•   the valuation and recoverability of long-lived assets, which impacts gross margin and operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation or amortization.
we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements regarding the critical accounting estimates indicated above. see note 2, "summary of significant accounting policies," of our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our accounting policies.
revenue recognition: we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, collection of the receivable is reasonably assured, and we have received customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations. if terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period, we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance, whichever occurs first. if the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision, we recognize revenue when it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreed-to customer specifications. in situations with multiple deliverables, we recognize revenue upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations. we allocate revenue from multiple-element arrangements among the separate elements using their relative selling prices, based on our best estimate of selling price. our sales arrangements do not include a general right of return. the maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items. we generally recognize revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits upon shipment. we generally recognize revenue related to services upon completion of the services requested by a customer order. we recognize revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. when goods or services have been delivered to the customer, but all conditions for revenue recognition have not been met, deferred revenue and deferred costs are recorded in deferred profit on our consolidated balance sheet.
inventory valuation: our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods, and spare parts in each reporting period. obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management's estimated usage requirement is written down to its estimated market value if less than continues on next page lam research corporation 2017 10-k 38
cost. estimates of market value include but are not limited to management's forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and/or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, and possible alternative uses. if future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period in which we make the revision.
warranty: we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system when we recognize revenue. we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. we do not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific systems.
equity-based compensation: employee stock purchase plan ("espp") and employee stock plans: we determine the fair value of our restricted stock units ("rsus"), excluding market-based performance rsus, based upon the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant, discounted for dividends. we estimate the fair value of our market-based performance rsus using a monte carlo simulation model at the date of the grant. we estimate the fair value of our stock options and espp awards using a black-scholes option valuation model. this model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award. we amortize the fair value of equity-based awards over the vesting periods of the award and we have elected to use the straight-line method of amortization. we estimate expected equity award forfeitures based on historical forfeiture rate activity and expected future employee turnover. we recognize the effect of adjustments made to the forfeiture rate, if any in the period that we change the forfeiture estimate.
income taxes: deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed.
we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.
long-lived assets: we review goodwill at least annually for impairment. if certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests, we will perform an impairment test at that date. in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, we: (1) allocate goodwill to the reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates; (2) estimate the fair value of our reporting units; and (3) determine the carrying value (book value) of those reporting units. prior to this allocation of the assets to the reporting units, we assess long-lived assets for impairment. furthermore, if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we must estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of that reporting unit, in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business. this can require independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as in-process r&d and developed technology. only after this process is completed can the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, be determined. in our goodwill impairment process we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative analysis. we do not calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount.
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis. we determine the fair value of our reporting units by using an income approach. under the income approach, we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit, continues on next page lam research corporation 2017 10-k 39
discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn.
in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit, we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of our reporting units, including estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment. although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit. in addition, we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units. changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge.
as a result, several factors could result in an impairment of a material amount of our goodwill balance in future periods, including but not limited to: (1) weakening of the global economy, weakness in the semiconductor equipment industry, or our failure to reach internal forecasts, which could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted levels of cash flows and reduce the estimated discounted cash flow value of our reporting units; and (2) a decline in our common stock price and resulting market capitalization, to the extent we determine that the decline is sustained and indicates a reduction in the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. further, the value assigned to intangible assets, other than goodwill, is based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations such as the success and lifecycle of products and technology acquired. if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates, we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value.
for other long-lived assets, we routinely consider whether indicators of impairment are present. if such indicators are present, we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets is less than their carrying value. if the sum is less, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values. fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows, appraisals or other methods. we recognize an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset's carrying value. the fair value of the asset then becomes the asset's new carrying value, which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset. assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value.

liquidity and capital resources total gross cash, cash equivalents, investments, and restricted cash and investments balances were $6.3 billion at the end of fiscal year 2017 compared to $7.1 billion at the end of fiscal year 2016. this decrease was primarily due to the redemption of our senior notes with contractual maturities in 2023 and 2026. approximately $4.8 billion and $3.1 billion of our total cash and investments as june 25, 2017, and june 26, 2016, respectively, was held outside the united states in our foreign subsidiaries, the majority of which is held in u.s. dollars, and substantially all of which would be subject to tax at u.s. rates if it were to be repatriated. refer to note 6 of our consolidated financial statements, included in item 8 of this report, for information concerning the potential tax impact of repatriating earnings of certain non-u.s. subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested outside the united states.

significant changes in operating asset and liability accounts, net of foreign exchange impact, included the following uses of cash: increases in accounts receivable of $411 million, inventories of $308 million, and prepaid expenses and other assets of $27 million, partially offset by the following sources of cash: increases in accounts payable of $127 million, deferred profit of $258 million, and accrued expenses and other liabilities of $50 million.
cash flow from investing activities net cash used for investing activities during fiscal year 2017 was $2.1 billion, primarily consisting of net purchases of available-for-sale securities of $1.9 billion, and capital expenditures of $157 million.
cash flow from financing activities net cash used by financing activities during fiscal year 2017 was $2.6 billion, primarily consisting of $1.7 billion of cash paid for debt extinguishment, $812 million in treasury stock repurchases, and $243 million of dividends paid, partially offset by $73 million of stock issuance and treasury stock reissuances associated with our employee stock-based compensation plans.
liquidity given that the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and has historically experienced rapid changes in demand, we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in r&d and capital infrastructure. anticipated cash flows from operations based on our current business outlook, combined with our current levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of june 25, 2017, are expected to be sufficient to support our anticipated levels of operations, investments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures, capital redistributions, and dividends through at least the next 12 months. however, uncertainty in the global economy and the semiconductor industry, as well as disruptions in credit markets, have in the past, and could in the future, impact customer demand for our products, as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers, and creditors.
in the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products and services. while we have substantial cash balances in the united states and offshore, we may require additional funding and need or choose to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. we believe that, if necessary, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. however, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us.

(1)   the conversion period for the convertible notes was open as of june 25, 2017, and as such the net carrying value of the convertible notes is included within current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. the principal balances of the convertible notes are reflected in the payment period in the table above based on the contractual maturity assuming no conversion. see note 13 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning the convertible notes and associated conversion features.
(2)   certain tax-related liabilities and post-retirement benefits classified as other non-current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet are included in the "more than five years" category due to the uncertainty in the timing and amount of future payments. additionally, the balance excludes contractual obligations recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as current liabilities.
operating leases we lease most of our administrative, r&d, and manufacturing facilities; regional sales/service offices; and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. certain of our facility leases for buildings located in fremont and livermore, california, and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities. certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation. in addition to amounts included in the table above, we have guaranteed residual values for certain of our fremont and livermore facility leases of up to $250 million. see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
capital leases capital leases reflect building and office equipment lease obligations. the amounts in the table above include the interest portion of payment obligations.
purchase obligations purchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multi-year periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments, including vendor-consigned inventories. the contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at june 25, 2017, under these arrangements and others. for obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee. actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided.

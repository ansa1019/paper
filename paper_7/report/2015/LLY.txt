(1)  operating expense consists of research and development and marketing, selling, and administrative expenses.
nm - not meaningful revenue and gross margin increased slightly in 2015. operating expense in 2015 remained essentially flat as a decrease in marketing, selling, and administrative expense was largely offset by increased research and development expense. net income and eps increased slightly in 2015 as a higher gross margin, lower income taxes, and decreased asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges were largely offset by increased acquired in-process research and development (ipr&d) charges and lower other income.
the following highlighted items affect comparisons of our 2015 and 2014 financial results:
2015
acquisitions (note 3 to the consolidated financial statements)
•   we recognized expense of $153.0 million (pretax), or $0.10 per share, related to the fair value adjustments to novartis animal health (novartis ah) acquisition date inventory that has been sold.
acquired ipr&d (notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements)
•   we recognized acquired ipr&amp;d charges of $535.0 million (pretax), or $0.33 per share, related to upfront fees paid in connection with various collaboration agreements primarily with pfizer, inc. (pfizer), as well as the consideration paid to acquire the worldwide rights to locemia solutions' (locemia) intranasal glucagon.
30
asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges (note 5 to the consolidated financial statements)
•   we recognized charges of $367.7 million (pretax), or $0.25 per share, related to severance costs, integration costs, and intangible asset impairments.
debt repurchase (notes 7 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements)
•   we recognized net charges of $152.7 million (pretax), or $0.09 per share, attributable to the debt extinguishment loss of $166.7 million from the purchase and redemption of certain fixed-rate notes, partially offset by net gains from non-hedging interest rate swaps and foreign currency transactions associated with the related issuance of lower interest rate euro-denominated notes.
2014
acquired ipr&d (notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements)
•   we recognized acquired ipr&amp;d charges of $200.2 million (pretax), or $0.12 per share, related to acquired ipr&amp;d from various collaboration agreements.
collaborations (note 4 to the consolidated financial statements)
•   we recognized income of $92.0 million (pretax), or $0.06 per share, related to the transfer of our linagliptin and empagliflozin commercial rights in certain countries to boehringer ingelheim.
asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges (note 5 to the consolidated financial statements)
•   we recognized charges of $468.7 million (pretax), or $0.38 per share, related to severance costs associated with our ongoing cost containment efforts to reduce our cost structure and global workforce, and asset impairments primarily associated with the closure of a manufacturing site in puerto rico.
other
•   we recognized a marketing, selling, and administrative expense of $119.0 million (non-tax deductible), or $0.11 per share, for an extra year of the united states branded prescription drug fee (u.s. drug fee) due to final regulations issued by the internal revenue service (irs) which required us to accelerate into 2014 the recording of an expense for the 2015 fee.
late-stage pipeline our long-term success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on molecules currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. we currently have approximately 50 potential new drugs in human testing or under regulatory review, and a larger number of projects in preclinical research.

there are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development and the introduction of new products. a high rate of failure is inherent in new drug discovery and development. the process to bring a drug from the discovery phase to regulatory approval can take over a decade and cost more than $1 billion. failure can occur at any point in the process, including late in the process after substantial investment. as a result, most research programs will not generate financial returns. new product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success. delays and uncertainties in the regulatory approval processes in the u.s. and in other countries can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunities. consequently, it is very difficult to predict which products will ultimately be approved.
we manage research and development spending across our portfolio of molecules, and a delay in, or termination of, any one project will not necessarily cause a significant change in our total research and development spending. due to the risks and uncertainties involved in the research and development process, we cannot reliably estimate the nature, timing, completion dates, and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our research and development projects, nor can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from a successful research and development project. each project represents only a portion of the overall pipeline, and none is individually material to our consolidated research and development expense. while we do accumulate certain research and development costs on a project level for internal reporting purposes, we must make significant cost estimations and allocations, some of which rely on data that are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms. therefore, we do not have sufficiently reliable data to report on total research and development costs by project, by preclinical versus clinical spend, or by therapeutic category.
other matters novartis animal health acquisition on january 1, 2015, we completed our acquisition of novartis ah in an all-cash transaction for $5.28 billion. novartis ah operates in approximately 40 countries. we acquired novartis ah's nine manufacturing sites, six dedicated research and development facilities, a global commercial infrastructure with a portfolio of approximately 600 products, a pipeline with more than 40 projects in development, and more than 3,000 employees. the combined organization has increased our animal health product portfolio, expanded our global commercial presence, and augmented our animal health manufacturing and research and development. in particular, it has provided elanco with a greater commercial presence in the companion animal and swine markets, expanded elanco's presence in equine and vaccines areas, and created an entry into the aquaculture market. as a condition to the clearance of the transaction under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvement act, following the closing of the acquisition of novartis ah, we divested certain companion animal assets in the u.s. related to the sentinel® canine parasiticide franchise to virbac corporation for approximately $410 million. the novartis ah business we retained generated revenue of approximately $1.1 billion in 2014.

patent matters we depend on patents or other forms of intellectual-property protection for most of our revenues, cash flows, and earnings. the loss of u.s. patent exclusivity for cymbalta® in december 2013 and evista® in march 2014, resulted in the immediate entry of generic competitors and a rapid and severe decline in revenue from the affected products, having, in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows.
we lost our data package protection for cymbalta in major european countries in 2014. in 2015, we saw the entry of generic competition in all major european markets. the loss of exclusivity for cymbalta in the european markets has caused a rapid and severe decline in revenue for the product, which over time will, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows. we also lost patent exclusivity for the schizophrenia indication in december 2015 for zyprexa® in japan. we will lose our patent protection for the bipolar mania indication in april 2016 for zyprexa in japan. generic versions of zyprexa were approved in japan in february 2016. we cannot speculate whether the generic company will apply for pricing and proceed to launch.
additionally, as described in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the alimta® vitamin regimen patent, which provides us with patent protection for alimta through june 2021 in japan and major european countries, and through may 2022 in the u.s., has been challenged in each of these jurisdictions. our compound patent for alimta will expire in the u.s. in january 2017, and expired in major european countries and japan in december 2015. we expect that the entry of generic competition for alimta into these markets following the loss of effective patent protection will cause a rapid and severe decline in revenue for the product, which will, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows. we are aware that a generic competitor has received approval to market a generic version of alimta in a major european country, although we are not aware of whether this competitor's product has entered the market. notwithstanding our patents, generic versions of alimta were approved in japan in february 2016. we filed preliminary injunctions against four generic competitors. we do not anticipate generic competitors to proceed to launch prior to the completion of the sawai invalidation trial, as described in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.
the u.s. compound patent for humalog® expired in 2013. thus far, the loss of compound patent protection for humalog has not resulted in a rapid and severe decline in revenue. global regulators have different legal pathways to approve similar versions of humalog and to date none have been approved in the u.s. or europe. we are aware that other manufacturers have efforts underway to develop a similar version of humalog, and it is difficult to predict the likelihood, timing, and impact of these products entering the market.
foreign currency exchange rates as a global company with substantial operations outside the u.s., we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the u.s. dollar against the euro, japanese yen, and british pound, and the british pound against the euro. while we manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques, significant fluctuations in currency rates can have a substantial impact, either positive or negative, on our revenue, cost of sales, and operating expenses. over the past two years, we have seen significant foreign currency rate fluctuations as the u.s. dollar strengthened compared to several other foreign currencies, including the euro, british pound, and japanese yen. while there is uncertainty in the future movements in foreign exchange rates, these fluctuations could negatively impact our future consolidated results of operations.

trends affecting pharmaceutical pricing, reimbursement, and access united states in the u.s., public concern over prices for specialty and brand name pharmaceuticals continues to drive the legislative debate. these policy and political issues increase the risk that taxes, fees, rebates or other federal and state measures may be enacted. key health policy proposals affecting biopharmaceuticals include a reduction in biologic data exclusivity, modifications to medicare parts b and d, new language that would allow the department of health and human services to negotiate prices for biologics and drugs on the specialty tier in part d, and state-level proposals to reduce the cost of pharmaceuticals purchased by government health care programs. savings projected under these proposals are targeted as a means to fund both health care expenditures and non-health care initiatives, or to manage federal and state budgets.
in the u.s. private sector, consolidation and integration among u.s. healthcare providers is also a major factor in the competitive marketplace for human pharmaceuticals. health plans and pharmaceutical benefit managers have been consolidating into fewer, larger entities, thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance. payers typically maintain formularies which specify coverage (the conditions under which drugs are included on a plan's formulary) and reimbursement (the associated out-of-pocket cost to the consumer). formulary placement can lead to reduced usage of a drug for the relevant patient population due to coverage restrictions, such as prior authorizations and formulary exclusions, or due to reimbursement limitations which result in higher consumer out-of-pocket cost, such as non-preferred co-pay tiers, increased co-insurance levels and higher deductibles. consequently, pharmaceutical companies compete for formula placement not only on the basis of product attributes such as greater efficacy, fewer side effects, or greater patient ease of use, but also by providing rebates. price is an increasingly important factor in formulary decisions, particularly in treatment areas in which the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable. these downward pricing pressures could negatively affect future consolidated results of operations.
the main coverage expansion provisions of the affordable care act (aca) are now in effect through both the launch of state-based exchanges and the expansion of medicaid. an emerging trend has been the prevalence of benefit designs containing high out-of-pocket costs for patients, particularly for pharmaceuticals. in addition to the coverage expansions, many employers in the commercial market, driven in part by aca changes such as the 2020 implementation of the excise tax on employer-sponsored health care coverage for which there is an excess benefit (the so-called "cadillac tax"), continue to evaluate strategies such as private exchanges and wider use of consumer-driven health plans to reduce their healthcare liabilities over time. at the same time, the broader paradigm shift towards quality-based reimbursement and the launch of several value-based purchasing initiatives have placed demands on the pharmaceutical industry to offer products with proven real-world outcomes data and a favorable economic profile.
international international operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations. cost-containment measures exist in a number of countries, including additional price controls and mechanisms to limit reimbursement for our products. such policies are expected to increase in impact and reach, given the pressures on national and regional health care budgets that come from a growing aging population and ongoing economic challenges. in addition, governments in many emerging markets are becoming increasingly active in expanding health care system offerings. given the budget challenges of increasing health care coverage for citizens, policies may be proposed that promote generics only and reduce current and future access to human pharmaceutical products.
38
tax matters we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. changes in the relevant tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could adversely affect our future effective tax rates. the u.s. and a number of other countries are actively considering or enacting changes in this regard. for example, the obama administration proposed changes to the manner in which the u.s. would tax the international income of u.s.-based companies, including unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries. other tax proposals under discussion or introduced in the u.s. congress could change the tax rate and manner in which u.s. companies would be taxed. additionally, the organisation for economic co-operation and development issued its final recommendations of international tax reform proposals to influence international tax policy in major countries in which we operate. while outcomes of these initiatives continue to develop and remain uncertain, changes to key elements of the u.s. or international tax framework could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results and cash flows.

in the u.s., the volume increase in 2015 was driven by the inclusion of revenue from novartis ah and increased volumes for several pharmaceutical products, partially offset by the residual impact of the loss of exclusivity for cymbalta and evista.
outside the u.s., the volume increase in 2015 was driven by the inclusion of revenue from novartis ah and increased volumes for several pharmaceutical products.
on a pro forma basis, which reflects the 2014 revenues of novartis ah as described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, our consolidated volume in 2015 would have increased by 2 percent compared with 2014.

(1)   u.s. revenue includes revenue in puerto rico.
(2) other pharmaceutical products includes revenue of $175.6 million and $46.1 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, for erbitux®. the 2015 revenue is primarily associated with net product revenue from third parties subsequent to the transfer of commercialization rights in the u.s. and canada (collectively, north america) from bristol-myers squibb company and e.r. squibb (collectively, bms) to us in the fourth quarter. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
(3)   collaboration and other revenue consists primarily of revenue associated with trajenta® (which includes jentadueto®) of $356.8 million and $328.8 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, as well as royalties for erbitux prior to the transfer of commercialization of rights in north america from bms to us of $309.4 million and $327.2 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
nm - not meaningful revenues of humalog, our injectable human insulin analog for the treatment of diabetes, increased 9 percent in the u.s., driven by higher realized prices and, to a lesser extent, increased volume. revenues outside the u.s. decreased 8 percent, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by higher volume.
revenues of alimta, a treatment for various cancers, decreased 5 percent in the u.s., driven by decreased demand and, to a lesser extent, lower realized prices. revenues outside the u.s. decreased 15 percent, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and, to a lesser extent, lower realized prices, partially offset by increased volume.
revenues of cialis, a treatment for erectile dysfunction and benign prostatic hyperplasia, increased 21 percent in the u.s., driven by higher realized prices. revenues outside the u.s. decreased 16 percent, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.
revenues of forteo, an injectable treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men at high risk for fracture and for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in men and postmenopausal women, increased 14 percent in the u.s., driven by higher realized prices, partially offset by decreased volume. revenues outside the u.s. decreased 6 percent, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by increased volume.
40
revenues of humulin, an injectable human insulin for the treatment of diabetes, increased 7 percent in the u.s., driven by higher realized prices and, to a lesser extent, wholesaler buying patterns, partially offset by decreased demand. revenues outside the u.s. decreased 21 percent, driven by decreased volume, primarily due to the loss of a government contract in brazil, and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.
revenues of cymbalta, a product for the treatment of major depressive disorder, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, generalized anxiety disorder, chronic musculoskeletal pain, and the management of fibromyalgia, decreased 66 percent in the u.s. due to the loss of u.s. patent exclusivity in december 2013. revenues outside the u.s. decreased 26 percent, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and the loss of exclusivity in europe in 2014.
revenues of zyprexa, a treatment for schizophrenia, acute mixed or manic episodes associated with bipolar i disorder, and bipolar maintenance, increased 31 percent in the u.s., driven by adjustments to the return reserve resulting from the expiration of the period to return expired product for credit. revenues outside the u.s. decreased 15 percent, driven primarily by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. we lost patent exclusivity for zyprexa in japan in december 2015. zyprexa revenues in japan were $415.9 million in 2015, compared with $466.2 million in 2014. the revenue decrease in japan was due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.
revenues of strattera, a treatment for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, increased 11 percent in the u.s., driven by higher realized prices and, to a lesser extent, increased demand. revenues outside the u.s. decreased 1 percent, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, largely offset by increased volume.
revenues of effient, a product for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events (including stent thrombosis) in patients with acute coronary syndrome who are managed with an artery-opening procedure known as percutaneous coronary intervention, including patients undergoing angioplasty, atherectomy, or stent placement, increased 6 percent in the u.s., driven by higher realized prices, partially offset by decreased demand. revenues outside the u.s. decreased 17 percent, driven primarily by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.
revenues of evista, a product for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and for reduction of risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive breast cancer, decreased 70 percent in the u.s., due to the loss of patent exclusivity in march 2014. revenues outside the u.s. decreased 17 percent, driven primarily by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.
revenues of animal health products in the u.s. increased 21 percent and animal health product revenues outside the u.s. increased 53 percent. the increases were driven by the inclusion of revenue from novartis ah.
on a pro forma basis, which reflects the 2014 revenues of novartis ah as described in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, revenues of animal health products in the u.s. would have decreased 1 percent, driven primarily by decreased volume in food animal products. revenues outside the u.s. would have decreased 13 percent, driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates and decreased volume in companion animal products, partially offset by higher realized prices and volume for food animal products.
gross margin, costs, and expenses gross margin as a percent of total revenue was 74.8 percent in 2015, essentially flat compared with 2014 as the unfavorable impacts of the inclusion of novartis ah and inventory step-up and amortization costs were offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold.
research and development expenses increased 1 percent to $4.80 billion in 2015, driven primarily by higher late-stage clinical development costs, the inclusion of novartis ah, and an increase in charges associated with the termination of late-stage molecules, primarily evacetrapib and basal insulin peglispro, of approximately $135 million, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.
41
marketing, selling, and administrative expenses decreased 1 percent to $6.53 billion in 2015, due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and a 2014 charge associated with the u.s. drug fee, partially offset by the inclusion of novartis ah and expenses related to new product launches.
we recognized acquired ipr&d charges of $535.0 million in 2015 resulting from various collaboration agreements, primarily with pfizer, as well as the consideration paid to acquire the worldwide rights to locemia's intranasal glucagon. there were $200.2 million of acquired ipr&d charges in 2014 related to various collaboration agreements, including charges associated with the transfer of commercial rights to us, from boehringer ingelheim, of the new insulin glargine product in certain countries where it was not yet approved. see notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
we recognized asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges of $367.7 million in 2015. the charges relate to severance costs, integration costs for novartis ah, and asset impairments. in 2014, we recognized charges of $468.7 million for asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges. the charges included severance costs, asset impairments primarily associated with the closure of a manufacturing site in puerto rico, and integration costs for the then-pending acquisition of novartis ah. see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
other-net, (income) expense was income of $100.6 million in 2015, compared with income of $340.5 million in 2014. other income in 2015 included net gains of $236.7 million on investments, partially offset by a net charge of $152.7 million related to the repurchase of $1.65 billion of debt. other income in 2014 included net gains of $216.4 million on investments and $92.0 million of income associated with the transfer of commercial rights to linagliptin and empagliflozin in certain countries from us to boehringer ingelheim. see notes 4 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
our effective tax rate was 13.7 percent in 2015, compared with 20.3 percent in 2014. the effective tax rate for 2014 reflects the impact of a $119.0 million nondeductible charge associated with the u.s. drug fee. the decrease in the tax rate for 2015 compared with 2014 is primarily due to a favorable tax impact of the net charges related to the repurchase of debt, acquired ipr&d, and asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges. see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

revenues of humalog increased 7 percent in the u.s., driven by increased demand, partially offset by lower realized prices as a result of payer contracts and greater medicaid and medicare utilization, as well as wholesaler buying patterns. revenues outside the u.s. increased 6 percent, driven by increased volume and, to a lesser extent, higher realized prices, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.
revenues of cialis increased 10 percent in the u.s., driven by higher realized prices, partially offset by wholesaler buying patterns. revenues outside the u.s. increased 3 percent, driven by higher realized prices and increased volume, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.
revenues of cymbalta decreased 89 percent in the u.s. due to the loss of u.s. patent exclusivity in december 2013. revenues outside the u.s. increased 6 percent, driven by increased volume, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.
revenues of humulin increased 5 percent in the u.s., primarily driven by increased demand, partially offset by wholesaler buying patterns. revenues outside the u.s. increased 8 percent, driven by increased volume, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.
revenues of forteo increased 5 percent in the u.s., driven by higher realized prices, partially offset by decreased volume. revenues outside the u.s. increased 7 percent, driven by increased volume, primarily in japan, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, primarily the japanese yen.
revenues of zyprexa decreased 3 percent in the u.s. revenues outside the u.s. decreased 14 percent, driven by decreased volume, the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, primarily the japanese yen, and lower realized prices.
revenues of strattera increased 1 percent in the u.s., driven by higher realized prices, partially offset by decreased volume. revenues outside the u.s. increased 9 percent, driven by increased volume, primarily in japan, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, primarily the japanese yen.
44
revenues of effient increased 5 percent in the u.s., driven by higher realized prices, partially offset by wholesaler buying patterns. revenues outside the u.s. decreased 3 percent, driven by lower volume.
revenues of evista decreased 73 percent in the u.s., due to the loss of u.s. patent exclusivity in march 2014. revenues outside the u.s. decreased 24 percent, driven primarily by the expiration of a supply agreement in 2013, and to a lesser extent the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.
animal health product revenues in the u.s. increased 4 percent, driven by increased volume in food animal products and higher realized prices, partially offset by decreased volume in companion animal products due to competitive pressure. revenues outside the u.s. increased 16 percent, driven by increased volume in food animal products, due in part to the acquisition of lohmann se and, to a lesser extent, higher realized prices, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates.
gross margin, costs, and expenses gross margin as a percent of total revenue was 74.9 percent in 2014, a decrease of 3.9 percentage points compared with 2013, driven primarily by lower sales of cymbalta and evista following u.s. patent expirations.
research and development expenses decreased 14 percent to $4.73 billion in 2014, driven primarily by lower late-stage clinical development costs. research and development expenses in 2013 included $97.2 million of milestone payments made to boehringer ingelheim following regulatory submissions for empagliflozin.
marketing, selling, and administrative expenses decreased 7 percent to $6.62 billion in 2014, driven primarily by the reduction in u.s. sales and marketing activities for cymbalta and evista, as well as ongoing cost containment efforts, partially offset by an additional $119.0 million charge in 2014 associated with the u.s. drug fee, an annual non-tax deductible fee enacted by the patient protection and affordable care act that is imposed on us and others engaged in the business of manufacturing or importing branded prescription drugs. the final regulations issued by the irs in 2014, accelerated the expense recognition criteria for the fee obligation by one year, from the year in which the fee is paid to the year in which the sales used to calculate the fee occur. this change resulted in the need to expense two years of the u.s. drug fee in 2014 to account for the fee imposed and paid in 2014 and the fee that would be imposed and paid in 2015.
we recognized acquired ipr&d charges of $200.2 million in 2014 resulting from our collaboration agreements with adocia, astrazeneca uk limited, and immunocore limited in addition to charges associated with the transfer of commercial rights to us, from boehringer ingelheim, of the new insulin glargine product in certain countries where it was not yet approved. there were $57.1 million of acquired ipr&d charges in 2013 related to the acquisition of rights for the cgrp antibody. see notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
we recognized asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges of $468.7 million in 2014. these charges included $225.5 million of severance costs and $243.2 million of asset impairment and other special charges consisting primarily of a $180.8 million asset impairment charge related to our decision to close and sell a manufacturing plant located in puerto rico. in 2013, we recognized asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges of $120.6 million. these charges included $30.0 million of asset impairments primarily associated with the closure of a packaging and distribution facility in germany and $90.6 million of severance costs. see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
other-net, (income) expense was income of $340.5 million in 2014, compared with income of $518.9 million in 2013. other income in 2014 included net gains of $216.4 million on investments and $92.0 million of income related to the transfer of commercial rights to linagliptin and empagliflozin in certain countries from us to boehringer ingelheim. other income in 2013 was primarily comprised of $495.4 million related to the termination of the exenatide collaboration with amylin. see notes 4 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
our effective tax rate was 20.3 percent in 2014, compared with 20.5 percent in 2013. see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

financial condition as of december 31, 2015, cash and cash equivalents was $3.67 billion, a decrease of $205.2 million, compared with $3.87 billion at december 31, 2014. refer to the consolidated statements of cash flows for additional details on the significant sources and uses of cash for the years ended december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014.
in addition to our cash and cash equivalents, we held total investments of $4.43 billion and $5.52 billion as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2014, respectively. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.
as of december 31, 2015, total debt was $7.98 billion, a slight decrease of $43.0 million compared with $8.02 billion at december 31, 2014. this decrease is due primarily to $2.68 billion of net repayments of short-term commercial paper borrowings, the repayment of $1.78 billion of fixed-rate notes in connection with the purchase and redemption of certain u.s. dollar-denominated notes in june 2015, and, to a lesser extent, the decrease in fair value of our hedged debt. these decreases were largely offset by the issuance of $4.45 billion of fixed-rate notes during 2015. at december 31, 2015, we had a total of $1.30 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities, $1.20 billion of which is available to support our commercial paper program. see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. we believe that amounts accessible through existing commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund short-term borrowing needs.
for the 130th consecutive year, we distributed dividends to our shareholders. dividends of $2.00 per share and $1.96 per share were paid in 2015 and 2014, respectively. in the fourth quarter of 2015, effective for the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2016, the quarterly dividend was increased to $0.51 per share, resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2016 of $2.04 per share.
capital expenditures of $1.07 billion during 2015 were $96.4 million less than in 2014. we expect 2016 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.1 billion.
in 2015, we repurchased $749.5 million of shares under the $5.00 billion share repurchase program previously announced in october 2013.
see "results of operations-executive overview-other matters" section for information regarding the actual or anticipated effect of losses of exclusivity for cymbalta (u.s. and europe), evista (u.s.), alimta (u.s., europe, and japan), and zyprexa (japan).
at december 31, 2015, we had an aggregate of $7.12 billion of cash and investments at our foreign subsidiaries. a significant portion of this amount would be subject to tax payments if such cash and investments were repatriated to the u.s. we record u.s. deferred tax liabilities for certain unremitted earnings, but when foreign earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s., no accrual for u.s. income taxes is provided. we believe cash provided by operating activities in the u.s. and planned repatriations of foreign earnings for which tax has been provided should be sufficient to fund our domestic operating needs, dividends paid to shareholders, share repurchases, and capital expenditures. various risks and uncertainties, including those discussed in "forward-looking statements" and item 1a, "risk factors," may, however, affect our operating results and cash generated from operations.
both domestically and abroad, we continue to monitor the potential impacts of the economic environment; the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and other customers, including foreign government-backed agencies and suppliers; the uncertain impact of health care legislation; and various international government funding levels.
in the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values. these fluctuations can vary the costs of financing, investing, and operating. we address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. the objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates. all derivative activities are for purposes other than trading.
our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short-term u.s. dollar interest rates. in an effort to manage interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance. based on our overall interest rate exposure at december 31, 2015 and 2014, including derivatives and other interest rate risk-sensitive instruments, a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, would not have a material impact on earnings, cash flows, or fair values of interest rate risk-sensitive instruments over a one-year period.
46
our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the u.s. dollar against the euro, japanese yen, and british pound, and the british pound against the euro. we face foreign currency exchange exposures when we enter into transactions arising from subsidiary trade and loan payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies. we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the u.s. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period. we may enter into foreign currency forward or option derivative contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates (principally the euro, the british pound, and the japanese yen). our corporate risk-management policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures. gains and losses on these derivative contracts offset, in part, the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets and liabilities. we periodically analyze the fair values of the outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts to determine their sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates. a hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates (primarily against the u.s. dollar) applied to the fair values of our outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, would not have a material impact on earnings, cash flows, or financial position over a one-year period. this sensitivity analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in exchange rates would have on the underlying foreign currency denominated transactions.
off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. we acquire and collaborate on potential products still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g., approval for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels). if required by the arrangement, we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained. because of the contingent nature of these payments, they are not included in the table of contractual obligations below.
individually, these arrangements are not material in any one annual reporting period. however, if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements were reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations or cash flows in that period. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. these arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product, which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments; however, we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves milestone objectives. we also note that, from a business perspective, we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products.
47
our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows:
payments due by period
(dollars in millions)                                                     total             less than1 year               1-3years               3-5years            more than5 years long-term debt, including interest payments(1)                    $10,880.2                  $192.0                  $1,792.4                 $939.2                 $7,956.6

(1)  our long-term debt obligations include both our expected principal and interest obligations and our interest rate swaps. we used the interest rate forward curve at december 31, 2015, to compute the amount of the contractual obligation for interest on the variable rate debt instruments and swaps.
(2)  we have included the following:
•   purchase obligations consisting primarily of all open purchase orders as of december 31, 2015. some of these purchase orders may be cancelable; however, for purposes of this disclosure, we have not distinguished between cancelable and noncancelable purchase obligations.
•   contractual payment obligations with each of our significant vendors, which are noncancelable and are not contingent.
(3)  we have included long-term liabilities consisting primarily of our nonqualified supplemental pension funding requirements and deferred compensation liabilities. we excluded long-term income taxes payable of $868.9 million, because we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash outflows associated with those liabilities.
the contractual obligations table is current as of december 31, 2015. we expect the amount of these obligations to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed, terminated, or modified.
application of critical accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s., we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. for any given individual estimate or assumption we make, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. we believe that, given current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity for the periods presented in this report. our most critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below.
revenue recognition and sales return, rebate, and discount accruals we recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. provisions for returns, rebates, and discounts are established in the same period the related sales are recorded.
48
sales returns - background and uncertainties we regularly review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers in the u.s. and in major markets outside the u.s., primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products, or alternative approaches. we attempt to maintain u.s. wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio. causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated product-supply issues, weather patterns, anticipated changes in the transportation network, redundant holiday stocking, and changes in wholesaler business operations. in the u.s., the current structure of our arrangements does not provide an incentive for speculative wholesaler buying and provides us with data on inventory levels at our wholesalers. when we believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have caused an unusual increase or decrease in the sales of a major product compared with underlying demand, we disclose this in our product sales discussion if we believe the amount is material to the product sales trend; however, we are not always able to accurately quantify the amount of stocking or destocking in the retail channel. wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns.
when sales occur, we estimate a reserve for future product returns related to those sales. this estimate is based on several factors, including: historical return rates, expiration date by product (generally, 24 to 36 months after the initial sale of a product to our customer), and estimated levels of inventory in the wholesale and retail channels, among others, as well as any other specifically-identified anticipated returns due to known factors such as the loss of patent exclusivity, product recalls and discontinuances, or a changing competitive environment. we maintain a returns policy that allows u.s. pharmaceutical customers to return product for dating issues within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the product's expiration date. following the loss of exclusivity for a patent-dependent product, we expect to experience an elevated level of product returns as product inventory remaining in the wholesale and retail channels expires. adjustments to the returns reserve may be required in the future based on revised estimates to our assumptions, which would have an impact on our consolidated results of operations. we record the return amounts as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales. once the product is returned, it is destroyed. actual product returns have been less than 2 percent of our net sales over the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percentage of sales. we expect the ratio of actual product returns as a percentage of net sales to increase in future periods as we begin to experience elevated return levels for cymbalta following the loss of patent exclusivity in the u.s. market.
sales rebates and discounts - background and uncertainties we establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same period as the related sales. the rebate and discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net product sales. sales rebates and discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include medicaid, managed care, medicare, chargebacks, long-term care, hospital, patient assistance programs, and various other programs. we base these accruals primarily upon our historical rebate and discount payments made to our customer segment groups and the provisions of current rebate and discount contracts.
the largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by medicaid and managed care contracts. in determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical medicaid and managed care rebate payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends (e.g., patent expiries), an evaluation of the current medicaid and managed care contracts, the percentage of our products that are sold via medicaid and managed care contracts, and our product pricing. although we accrue a liability for medicaid and managed care rebates at the time we record the sale (when the product is shipped), the medicaid and managed care rebate related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later. because of this time lag, in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods.
most of our rebates outside the u.s. are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales. in some large european countries, government rebates are based on the anticipated budget for pharmaceutical payments in the country. a best estimate of these rebates, updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits, is recognized in the same period as the related sale. if our estimates are not reflective of the actual pharmaceutical costs incurred by the government, we adjust our rebate reserves.
49
financial statement impact we believe that our accruals for sales returns, rebates, and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. our global rebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet. our global sales return liability is included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. as of december 31, 2015, a 5 percent change in our global sales return, rebate, and discount liability would have led to an approximate $158 million effect on our income before income taxes.
the portion of our global sales return, rebate, and discount liability resulting from sales of our products in the u.s. was 87 percent and 88 percent as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
the following represents a roll-forward of our most significant u.s. pharmaceutical sales return, rebate, and discount liability balances, including medicaid and managed care:
(dollars in millions)                                                               2015   2014
sales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, beginning of year           $2,241.4              $2,215.5
reduction of net sales due to sales returns, discounts, and rebates(1)       6,245.1               4,707.8
cash payments of discounts and rebates                                      (5,927.9   )          (4,681.9   )
sales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, end of year                 $2,558.6              $2,241.4
(1) adjustments of the estimates for these returns, rebates, and discounts to actual results were less than 1.5 percent of consolidated net sales for each of the years presented.
product litigation liabilities and other contingencies background and uncertainties product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are, by their nature, uncertain and are based upon complex judgments and probabilities. the factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation, the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation cases, the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation, and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions, if any. in addition, we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred, but not filed, to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage. we accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when both probable and reasonably estimable.
we also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance. in assessing our insurance coverage, we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions, the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company, the financial condition of the insurers, and the possibility of and length of time for collection. due to a very restrictive market for product liability insurance, we are self-insured for product liability losses for all our currently marketed products. in addition to insurance coverage, we also consider any third-party indemnification to which we are entitled, including the nature of the indemnification, the financial condition of the indemnifying party, and the possibility of and length of time for collection.
financial statement impact the litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets.
retirement benefits assumptions background and uncertainties defined benefit pension plan and retiree health benefit plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate, retirement age, and expected return on plan assets. these assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. in addition to the analysis below, see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits.
50
annually, we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. we use an actuarially determined, plan-specific yield curve of high quality, fixed income debt instruments to determine the discount rates. in evaluating the expected return on plan assets, we consider many factors, with a primary analysis of current and projected market conditions, asset returns and asset allocations (approximately 80 percent of which are growth investments); and the views of leading financial advisers and economists. we may also review our historical assumptions compared with actual results, as well as the discount rates and expected return on plan assets of other companies, where applicable. in evaluating our expected retirement age assumption, we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages.
financial statement impact if the 2015 discount rate for the u.s. defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans (u.s. plans) were to change by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by $42.9 million. as of january 1, 2016, we changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic pension and retiree health benefit plan costs. prior to this change, the service and interest costs were determined using a single weighted-average discount rate based on yield curves of high quality, fixed income debt instruments used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. this new method uses the spot yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the projected cash outflows of our obligations. the new method provides a more precise measure of interest and service costs by improving the correlation between the projected benefit cash flows and the specific spot yield curve rates. the change does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs is recorded in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. we will account for this as a change in estimate prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2016. the decrease in the 2016 service and interest costs is expected to be approximately $110 million compared to the previous method.
if the 2015 expected return on plan assets for u.s. plans were to change by a quarter percentage point, income before income taxes would change by $22.7 million. if our assumption regarding the 2015 expected age of future retirees for u.s. plans were adjusted by one year, our income before income taxes would be affected by $50.4 million. the u.s. plans, including puerto rico, represent approximately 75 percent of both the total projected benefit obligation and total plan assets at december 31, 2015.
impairment of indefinite-lived and long-lived assets background and uncertainties we review the carrying value of long-lived assets (both intangible and tangible) for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. we determine impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value. if an impairment is identified, a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset's net book value over its fair value, and the cost basis is adjusted.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and when certain impairment indicators are present. when required, a comparison of fair value to the carrying amount of assets is performed to determine the amount of any impairment.
several methods may be used to determine the estimated fair value of acquired ipr&d, all of which require multiple assumptions. we utilize the "income method," as described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
for acquired ipr&d assets, the risk of failure has been factored into the fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield a successful product, as discussed previously in the "late-stage pipeline" section. the nature of the pharmaceutical business is high-risk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects to build a successful portfolio of approved products. as such, it is likely that some acquired ipr&d assets will become impaired in the future.
estimates of future cash flows, based on what we believe to be reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, require management's judgment. actual results could vary materially from these estimates.

income taxes background and uncertainties we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. in the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities, which may result in future tax, interest, and penalty assessments by these authorities. inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation, and/or as concluded through the various jurisdictions' tax court systems. we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances. for example, adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law, the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. we believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. we recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
we have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets, primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in certain taxing jurisdictions. in evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets, we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption. implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense.
financial statement impact as of december 31, 2015, a 5 percent change in the amount of the uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of $20.2 million and $29.5 million, respectively.
acquisitions background and uncertainties to determine whether acquisitions or licensing transactions qualify as a business combination or as an asset acquisition, we make certain judgments, which include assessing whether the acquired set of activities would meet the definition of a business under the relevant accounting rules. this involves determining the inputs, processes, and outputs associated with the acquired set of activities.
if the acquired set of activities meets the definition of a business, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are required to be recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets, where applicable, is recorded as goodwill. if the acquired set of activities does not meet the definition of a business, the transaction is recorded as an acquisition of assets and, therefore, any acquired ipr&d that does not have an alternative future use is charged to expense at the acquisition date, and goodwill is not recorded. refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
the judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, as well as estimated asset lives, can materially affect our consolidated results of operations. the fair values of intangible assets, including acquired ipr&d, are determined using information available near the acquisition date based on expectations and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management. depending on the facts and circumstances, we may deem it necessary to engage an independent valuation expert to assist in valuing significant assets and liabilities.
the fair values of identifiable intangible assets are primarily determined using an "income method," as described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
52
the fair value of any contingent consideration liability that results from a business combination is determined using a market approach based on quoted market values, significant other observable inputs for identical or comparable assets or liabilities, or a discounted cash flow analysis. estimating the fair value of contingent consideration requires the use of significant estimates and judgments, including, but not limited to, revenue and the discount rate.
financial statement impact as of december 31, 2015, a 5 percent change in the contingent consideration liability would result in a change in income before income taxes of $33.5 million.

financial expectations for 2016
for the full year of 2016, we expect eps to be in the range of $2.83 to $2.93. we anticipate that total revenue will be between $20.2 billion and $20.7 billion. excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, we expect revenue growth from a number of established products including humalog, trajenta, cialis, forteo, strattera, erbitux, and animal health products, as well as higher revenues from new products including cyramza, trulicity, jardiance, portrazza, and basaglar. we expect this revenue growth to be partially offset by lower revenue from alimta as a result of increased competitive pressures.
we anticipate that gross margin as a percent of revenue will be approximately 74 percent in 2016. research and development expenses are expected to be in the range of $4.8 billion to $5.0 billion. other-net, (income) expense is expected to be income of up to $75 million. marketing, selling, and administrative expenses are expected to be in the range of $6.0 billion to $6.2 billion.
the 2016 tax rate is expected to be approximately 21 percent.
capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $1.1 billion.
amortization associated with the transfer of erbitux commercialization rights included in our 2016 financial guidance is subject to final acquisition accounting adjustments.
various risks and uncertainties, including those discussed in "forward-looking statements" and item 1a, "risk factors," may cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.

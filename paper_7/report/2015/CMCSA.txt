item 7: management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction and overview we are a global media and technology company with two primary businesses, comcast cable and nbcuniversal. we present our operations for comcast cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as cable communications, and our operations for nbcuniversal in four reportable business segments. the cable networks, broadcast television, filmed entertainment and theme parks segments comprise the nbcuniversal businesses (collectively, the "nbcuniversal segments").
in 2015, our consolidated revenue was $74.5 billion and our operating income was $16.0 billion.
2015 consolidated operating results by segment cable communications segment comcast cable is one of the nation's largest providers of video, high-speed internet and voice services ("cable services") to residential customers under the xfinity brand, and we also provide these and other services to business customers. as of december 31, 2015, our cable systems had 27.7 million total customer relationships; served 22.3 million video customers, 23.3 million high-speed internet customers and 11.5 million voice customers; and passed more than 55 million homes and businesses.
our cable communications segment generates revenue primarily from residential and business customers subscribing to our cable services, which we market individually and as bundled services, and from the sale of advertising. customers are typically billed in advance on a monthly basis based on the services and features they receive and the type of equipment they use. the majority of our residential cable services customers are
41      comcast 2015 annual report on form 10-k not subject to minimum-term contracts for their services, while substantially all of our business customers are. minimum-term contracts are typically 2 years in length for residential customers and typically range from 2 to 5 years for business services customers. customers with minimum-term contracts may only discontinue service in accordance with the terms of their contracts, which may include an early termination fee.
residential cable services our cable communications segment offers a broad variety of video service packages that may include premium networks such as hbo, showtime, starz and cinemax; pay-per-view services; and our on demand service. our video customers may subscribe for additional fees to our high-definition video ("hd") and digital video recorder ("dvr") advanced services. we are actively deploying x1 set-top boxes throughout our footprint and have launched cloud dvr technology in substantially all of our markets.
we offer residential customers a variety of high-speed internet services with downstream speeds of up to 150 mbps and downstream speeds of up to 505 mbps in limited markets. we are actively deploying wireless gateways throughout our footprint, which combine a customer's wireless router, cable modem and voice adapter, to improve the performance of multiple internet-enabled devices used at the same time within the home, provide faster internet speeds and create an in-home wi-fi network. we are continuing to expand our network of residential, outdoor and business wi-fi hotspots to allow most of our high-speed internet customers to access our high-speed internet services inside and outside the home, and we provide access to approximately 13.3 million of these hotspots as of december 31, 2015.
we offer voice services that provide local and long-distance calling and other related features.
business services we offer our cable services to small and medium-sized businesses, and more recently, we have begun to offer services to large enterprises with multiple locations ("business services"). we offer to medium-sized businesses and large enterprises ethernet network services that connect multiple locations and provide higher downstream and upstream speed options. we also provide cellular backhaul services to mobile network operators to help those customers manage network bandwidth.
advertising our cable communications segment also sells advertising. as part of our distribution agreements with cable networks, we generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time on cable networks that our spotlight business sells to local, regional and national advertisers.
operating margin our cable communications segment operating margin is operating income before depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue. the most significant operating costs and expenses for our cable communications segment are the programming expenses we incur to provide content to our video customers. as further discussed in cable communications segment results of operations, we expect that our programming expenses will continue to increase, which may negatively impact our operating margin. we will attempt to mitigate increases in operating costs and expenses by growing revenue, particularly in our high-speed internet, video and business services businesses.
nbcuniversal segments nbcuniversal is one of the world's leading media and entertainment companies that develops, produces and distributes entertainment, news and information, sports, and other content for global audiences, as well as owns and operates several theme parks worldwide.

2015 developments the following are the more significant developments in our businesses during 2015:
cable communications segment
   an increase in cable communications segment revenue of 6.2% to $46.9 billion and an increase in cable communications segment operating income before depreciation and amortization of 5.6% to $19.1 billion
   an increase in cable communications segment capital expenditures of 14.3% to $7 billion primarily due to our continued investment in the following initiatives:
   the accelerated deployment of our ip and cloud-enabled video platform, referred to as our x1 platform, which is available in all of the markets in which we operate, and our cloud dvr technology, which is available in substantially all of our markets
43      comcast 2015 annual report on form 10-k
   the deployment of wireless gateways to more than 70% of our residential high-speed internet customers
   the improvement of our network infrastructure to increase network capacity
   the expansion of our business services, including the creation of the new enterprise service offering designed to serve certain fortune 1000 companies and other large nationwide enterprises with multiple locations
   investments to improve the customer experience, including by hiring additional personnel and developing and deploying various technology and software tools nbcuniversal segments
   an increase in total nbcuniversal revenue of 11.9% to $28.5 billion
   an increase in total nbcuniversal operating income before depreciation and amortization of 14.8% to $6.4 billion
   an increase in our filmed entertainment segment revenue of 45.5% largely due to the success of furious 7, jurassic world and minions, which each exceeded $1 billion in worldwide theatrical receipts
   an increase in our theme parks segment revenue of 27.3% due to the continued success of attractions at our universal theme parks, including the wizarding world of harry potter  diagon alley in orlando and the fast &amp; furious supercharged studio tour in hollywood
   the continued investment in original programming and sports programming rights at both our cable networks and broadcast television networks, including the premiere of nascar programming
   the acquisition of a 51% interest in universal studios japan for $1.5 billion competition the results of operations of our reportable business segments are affected by competition, as all of our businesses operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment, news and information content to consumers.
for additional information on the competition our businesses face, see item 1a: risk factors and refer to the risk factors entitled "our businesses currently face a wide range of competition, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively" and "changes in consumer behavior driven by alternative methods for viewing content may adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models" within that section.
seasonality and cyclicality each of our businesses is subject to seasonal and cyclical variations. in our cable communications segment, our results are impacted by the seasonal nature of customers receiving our cable services in college and vacation markets. this generally results in a reduction in net customer additions in the second quarter and an increase in net customer additions in the third and fourth quarters of each year.
revenue in our cable communications, cable networks and broadcast television segments is subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. our u.s. advertising revenue is generally higher comcast 2015 annual report on form 10-k   44
in the second and fourth quarters of each year, due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season. u.s. advertising revenue is also cyclical, with a benefit in even-numbered years due to advertising related to candidates running for political office and issue-oriented advertising. revenue in our cable networks and broadcast television segments fluctuates depending on the timing of when our programming is aired on television, which typically results in higher advertising revenue in the second and fourth quarters of each year. our revenue and operating costs and expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization ("operating costs and expenses") are cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of major sporting events such as the olympic games, which affect our cable networks and broadcast television segments, and the super bowl, which affect our broadcast television segment. our advertising revenue generally increases in the period of these broadcasts due to increased demand for advertising time, and our operating costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs and the amortization of the related rights fees.
revenue in our filmed entertainment segment fluctuates due to the timing of the release of films in movie theaters, on dvd and through digital distribution services. release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. as a result, revenue tends to be seasonal, with increases experienced each year during the summer months and around the holidays. revenue in our cable networks, broadcast television and filmed entertainment segments also fluctuates due to the timing of when our content is made available to licensees.
revenue in our theme parks segment fluctuates with changes in theme park attendance that result from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and weather variations, local entertainment offerings and the opening of new attractions. our theme parks generally experience peak attendance during the summer months when schools are closed and during early winter and spring holiday periods.

consolidated depreciation and amortization expenses increased in 2015 primarily due to increases in capital expenditures, as well as expenditures for software, in our cable communications segment in recent years. we continue to invest in customer premise equipment, primarily for our x1 platform, wireless gateways and cloud dvr technology, and in equipment to increase our network capacity. in addition, because these assets generally have shorter estimated useful lives, our depreciation expenses have increased, which we expect will
47      comcast 2015 annual report on form 10-k continue in 2016. in 2015, depreciation and amortization expenses included $20 million related to the acceleration of amortization for certain intangible assets and the write-off of certain capitalized costs associated with the termination of the time warner cable merger and related divestiture transactions. consolidated depreciation and amortization expenses increased slightly in 2014 primarily due to increases in capital spending in our cable communications and nbcuniversal segments, as well as increases related to our acquisitions in 2013 of our corporate headquarters and real estate properties for nbcuniversal.
segment operating results our segment operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information. we use operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, excluding impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses from the sale of assets, if any, as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments. this measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations. additionally, it is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities. we use this measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. it is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. we believe that this measure is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. because we use operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization to measure our segment profit or loss, we reconcile it to operating income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states ("gaap"), in the business segment footnote to our consolidated financial statements (see note 18 to comcast's consolidated financial statements and note 17 to nbcuniversal's consolidated financial statements). this measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to comcast corporation or nbcuniversal, net cash provided by operating activities, or other measures of performance or liquidity we have reported in accordance with gaap.
the revenue and operating costs and expenses associated with our broadcast of the 2015 super bowl were reported in our broadcast television segment. the revenue and operating costs and expenses associated with our broadcast of the 2014 sochi olympics were reported in our cable networks and broadcast television segments.

customer metrics include residential and business customers and are presented based on actual amounts. minor differences may exist due to rounding.
(a)   customer relationships represent the number of residential and business customers that subscribe to at least one of our cable services. single product, double product and triple product customers represent customers that subscribe to one, two or three of our cable services, respectively.
cable communications segment  revenue video video revenue increased 3.6% and 1.2% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. the increases in revenue in both years were due to increases in the number of residential customers receiving additional and higher levels of video service and rate adjustments, partially offset by decreases in the number of residential video customers. the increases in residential customers receiving additional and higher levels of video service and rate adjustments accounted for increases in revenue of 4.5% and 2.7% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. as of december 31, 2015, 13.9 million customers subscribed to at least one of our hd or dvr advanced services compared to 13.0 million customers and 12.5 million customers as of december 31, 2014 and 2013,
49      comcast 2015 annual report on form 10-k respectively. the decreases in the number of residential video customers in 2015 and 2014 were primarily due to competitive pressures and the impact of rate adjustments.
as of december 31, 2015, 40.1% of the homes and businesses in the areas we serve subscribed to our video services, compared to 40.9% and 41.9% as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. we may experience further declines in the number of residential video customers.
high-speed internet high-speed internet revenue increased 10.2% and 9.5% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. increases in the number of residential customers receiving our high-speed internet services accounted for increases in revenue of 5.8% and 5.9% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. the remaining increases in revenue in both 2015 and 2014 were primarily due to increases in the number of customers receiving higher levels of service and rate adjustments.
as of december 31, 2015, 41.9% of the homes and businesses in the areas we serve subscribed to our high-speed internet services, compared to 40.2% and 38.4% as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. our customer base continues to grow as consumers choose our high-speed internet service and seek higher-speed offerings.
voice voice revenue decreased 1.7% in 2015 and increased slightly in 2014. while the number of residential customers receiving voice services through our discounted bundled service offerings increased in both years, revenue was negatively impacted by the allocation of voice revenue for our customers who receive bundled services. the amount allocated to voice revenue in the rate charged for bundled services decreased in 2015 and 2014 because video and high-speed internet rates increased while voice rates remained relatively flat.
as of december 31, 2015, 20.6% of the homes and businesses in the areas we serve subscribed to our voice services, compared to 20.5% and 19.9% as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
business services business services revenue increased 20.0% and 21.9% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. the increases in 2015 and 2014 were primarily due to increases in the number of small business customers receiving our high-speed internet and voice services and rate adjustments. in 2015, 2014 and 2013, our small business customers represented more than 70% of total business services revenue. the remaining increases in both years were primarily due to continued growth in our medium-sized business services, including ethernet network and advanced voice services.
we believe the increases in the number of business customers were primarily the result of our efforts to gain market share from competitors by offering competitive services and pricing.
advertising as part of our distribution agreements with cable networks, we generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time on cable networks that our spotlight business sells to local, regional and national advertisers. in most cases, the available advertising units are sold by our sales force. in some cases, we work with representation firms as an extension of our sales force to sell a portion of the advertising time allocated to us. we also represent the advertising sales efforts of other multichannel video providers in some markets. in addition, we generate revenue from the sale of advertising online and on our on demand service. advertising revenue is affected by the strength of the advertising market and general economic conditions.
advertising revenue decreased 3.1% in 2015 primarily due to a decrease in political advertising revenue. excluding the impact of political advertising revenue, advertising revenue increased 3.7% in 2015. advertising comcast 2015 annual report on form 10-k   50
revenue increased 11.5% in 2014 primarily due to an increase in political revenue of 8.0%, as well as an increase in revenue in our national and local advertising markets. excluding the impact of political advertising revenue, advertising revenue increased 3.5% in 2014.
in 2015, 7% of our cable communications segment's advertising revenue was generated from our nbcuniversal segments, compared to 5% and 4% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. these amounts are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements but are included in the amounts presented above.
other other revenue primarily includes revenue related to cable franchise and other regulatory fees. we also receive revenue related to fees from other services, such as our home security and automation services. cable franchise and other regulatory fees represent the fees we are required to pay to federal, state and local authorities that we pass through to our customers. under the terms of our cable franchise agreements, we are generally required to pay to the cable franchising authority an amount based on our gross video revenue. the changes in franchise and other regulatory fees collected from our cable services customers are generally due to changes in the revenue on which the fees apply.
other revenue increased 9.6% and 5.1% in 2015 and 2014, respectively, primarily due to increases in revenue from our home security and automation services, as well as increases in cable franchise and other regulatory fees.
cable communications segment  operating costs and expenses our operating margin, which is our operating income before depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue, for 2015, 2014 and 2013 was 40.8%, 41.0% and 41.1%, respectively.
programming expenses programming expenses, which represent our most significant operating expense, are the fees we incur to provide content to our video customers. these expenses are affected by the programming license fees charged by cable networks, the fees charged for retransmission of the signals from local broadcast television stations, the number of video customers we serve and the amount of content we provide. programming expenses increased in 2015 and 2014 primarily due to increases in programming license fees, including sports programming costs and retransmission consent fees, and fees to secure rights for additional programming for our customers across an increasing number of platforms.
we anticipate that our programming expenses will continue to increase as we provide additional content to our video customers; as we deliver this content through an increasing number of platforms, including on demand, online and through our mobile apps; and as the fees we pay increase, primarily sports programming costs and retransmission consent fees. we believe that adding more content and delivering it on various platforms will help us to attract and retain video customers.
technical and product support expenses technical and product support expenses include costs to complete service call and installation activities, as well as costs for network operations, product development, fulfillment and provisioning. technical and product support expenses increased in 2015 and 2014 primarily due to expenses related to the development, delivery and support of our enhanced devices, including our x1 set-top boxes, cloud dvr technology and wireless gateways, and the continued growth in business services and home security and automation services. the increase in 2015 was also due to expenses related to investments we are making to improve the customer experience.
51      comcast 2015 annual report on form 10-k customer service expenses customer service expenses include the personnel and other costs associated with handling the sale of services to customers and customer service activity. customer service expenses increased in 2015 primarily due to increases in support for improving the customer experience and increases in total labor costs associated with increases in customer service activity. customer service expenses increased in 2014 due to increases in total labor costs associated with increases in customer service activity. the increases in customer service activity in both periods were due to sales and support activities associated with the continued deployment of our enhanced devices and services, which include our x1 platform, cloud dvr technology, wireless gateways, and home security and automation services, and the continued growth in business services.
franchise and other regulatory fees franchise and other regulatory fees increased in 2015 and 2014 primarily due to increases in the revenue on which the fees apply.
advertising, marketing and promotion expenses advertising, marketing and promotion expenses increased in 2015 and 2014 primarily due to increases in spending associated with attracting new residential and business services customers and encouraging existing customers to add additional or higher-tier services.
other operating costs and expenses other operating costs and expenses increased in 2015 and 2014 primarily due to increases in costs to support our advertising sales business, as well as increases in other administrative costs.

(a)                                                  as disclosed in note 11 to the comcast consolidated financial statements, nbcuniversal changed its method of accounting for a contractual obligation that involves an interest in the revenue of certain theme parks. as a result of the change, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015, amounts payable based on current period revenue are presented in operating costs and expenses. amounts paid through the third quarter of 2015 were included in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of income. for segment reporting purposes, we have adjusted periods prior to the fourth quarter of 2015 to reflect this expense on a consistent basis for all periods in the theme parks segment, which resulted in an offsetting adjustment in nbcuniversal headquarters, other and eliminations.

investment income (loss), net the change in investment income (loss), net in 2015 was primarily due to a $154 million gain related to the sale of our shares of arris group common stock in 2014. the change in investment income (loss), net in 2014 was primarily due to a $443 million gain related to the sale of our investment in clearwire corporation in 2013. the components of investment income (loss), net are presented in a table in note 7 to comcast's consolidated financial statements.
equity in net income (losses) of investees, net the change in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net in 2015 was primarily due to twcc holding corp. ("the weather channel") recording impairment charges related to goodwill. we recorded expenses of $333 million in 2015 that represent nbcuniversal's proportionate share of these impairment charges. the change in 2015 was also due to an increase in our proportionate share of losses in hulu, llc ("hulu"), which were driven by hulu's higher programming and marketing costs. in 2015 and 2014, we recognized our proportionate share of losses of $106 million and $20 million, respectively, related to our investment in hulu.
the change in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net in 2014 was primarily due to $142 million of total equity losses recorded in 2013 attributable to our investment in hulu. in july 2013, we entered into an agreement to provide capital contributions totaling $247 million to hulu, which we had previously accounted for as a cost method investment. this represented an agreement to provide our first capital contribution to hulu since we acquired our interest in it as part of our acquisition of a controlling interest in nbcuniversal in 2011 (the "nbcuniversal transaction"); therefore, we began to apply the equity method of accounting for this investment. the change in the method of accounting for this investment required us to recognize our proportionate share of hulu's accumulated losses from the date of the nbcuniversal transaction through july 2013.
other income (expense), net other income (expense), net for 2015 included gains of $335 million on the sales of a business and an investment, $240 million recorded on the settlement of a contingent consideration liability with general electric company ("ge") related to the acquisition of nbcuniversal, and $43 million related to an equity method investment. these gains were partially offset by $236 million of expenses related to fair value adjustments to a contractual obligation. see note 11 to comcast's consolidated financial statements for additional information on this contractual obligation.
other income (expense), net for 2014 included a $27 million favorable settlement of a contingency related to the at&t broadband transaction in 2002, which was more than offset by $208 million of expenses related to
61      comcast 2015 annual report on form 10-k fair value adjustments to contractual obligations and $35 million of expenses related to an indemnification receivable associated with the adjustment to our accruals for uncertain tax positions.
other income (expense), net for 2013 included a $108 million gain related to our sale of wireless communications spectrum licenses, which was more than offset by the net impact of an impairment of $236 million of our equity method investment in, and loans with, a regional sports cable network based in houston, texas and $136 million of expenses related to fair value adjustments to contractual obligations.
consolidated income tax expense income tax expense reflects federal and state income taxes and adjustments associated with uncertain tax positions. our effective income tax rate in 2015, 2014 and 2013 was 37.1%, 31.1% and 35.8%, respectively.
in 2014, we reduced our accruals for uncertain tax positions and the related accrued interest on these tax positions and, as a result, our income tax expense decreased by $759 million. see note 15 to comcast's consolidated financial statements for additional information on the changes in our accruals for uncertain tax positions and related interest on these tax positions. our 2013 income tax expense was reduced by $158 million due to the nontaxable portion of the increase in tax basis associated with the redemption of our liberty media series a common stock in october 2013.
our income tax expense in the future may continue to be impacted by adjustments to uncertain tax positions and related interest, and changes in tax laws. we expect our 2016 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 37% to 39%, absent changes in tax laws or significant changes in uncertain tax positions.
consolidated net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock the increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock in 2015 was primarily due to nbcuniversal's acquisition of universal studios japan. the decrease in 2014 was primarily due to the nbcuniversal redemption transaction.

(b)                                                purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services that are legally binding on us and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and price provisions. our purchase obligations related to our cable communications segment include programming contracts with cable networks and local broadcast television stations; contracts with customer premise equipment manufacturers, communications vendors and multichannel video providers for which we provide advertising sales representation; and other contracts entered into in the normal course of business. cable communications programming contracts in the table above include amounts payable under fixed or minimum guaranteed commitments and do not represent the total fees that are expected to be paid under programming contracts, which we expect to be significantly higher because these contracts are generally based on the number of subscribers receiving the programming. our purchase obligations related to our nbcuniversal segments consist primarily of commitments to acquire film and television programming, including u.s. television rights to future olympic games through 2032, sunday night football on the nbc network through the 2022-23 season, including the super bowl in 2018 and 2021, nhl games through the 2020-21 season, spanish-language u.s. television rights to fifa world cup games through 2022, u.s television rights to english premier league soccer games through the 2021-22 season, certain pga tour and other golf events through 2030 and certain nascar events through 2024, as well as obligations under various creative talent and employment agreements, including obligations to actors, producers, television personalities and executives, and various other television commitments. purchase obligations do not include contracts with immaterial future commitments.
(c)                                                 other long-term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet consist primarily of subsidiary preferred shares; deferred compensation obligations; and pension, postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations. a contractual obligation with a carrying value of $1.1 billion is not included in the table above because it is uncertain if the arrangement will be settled. the contractual obligation involves an interest held by a third party in the revenue of certain theme parks. the arrangement provides the counterparty with the right to periodic payments associated with current period revenue and, beginning in 2017, the option to require nbcuniversal to purchase the interest for cash in an amount based on a contractually specified formula, which amount could be significantly higher than our current carrying value. see note 11 to comcast's consolidated financial statements for additional information related to this arrangement. reserves for uncertain tax positions of $1.1 billion are not included in the table above because it is uncertain if and when these reserves will become payable. payments of $2.1 billion of participations and residuals are also not included in the table above because we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which these obligations will be settled.
(d)                                                   our contractual obligations do not include the commitment to invest up to $4 billion at any one time as an investor in atairos due to our inability to estimate the timing of this funding. in addition, we do not include any future expenditures related to the construction and development of the proposed universal studios theme park in beijing, china as we are not currently obligated to make such funding.

critical accounting judgments and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. we base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
we believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of our cable franchise rights and the accounting for film and television costs are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgments and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors, and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them, which are presented below. see notes 9 and 6 to comcast's consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies with respect to these items.
valuation and impairment testing of cable franchise rights our largest asset, our cable franchise rights, results from agreements we have with state and local governments that allow us to construct and operate a cable business within a specified geographic area. the value of a franchise is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market new services, such as advanced video services and high-speed internet and voice services, in a particular service area. the amounts we record for cable franchise rights are primarily a result of cable system acquisitions. typically when we acquire a cable system, the most significant asset we record is the value of the cable franchise rights. often these cable system acquisitions include multiple franchise areas. we currently serve approximately 6,400 franchise areas in the united states.
we have concluded that our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors which limit the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows. accordingly, we do not amortize our cable franchise rights but assess the carrying value of our cable franchise rights annually, or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed the fair value ("impairment testing").
67      comcast 2015 annual report on form 10-k for the purpose of our impairment testing, we have grouped the recorded values of our various cable franchise rights into our three cable communications divisions or units of account. we evaluate the unit of account periodically to ensure our impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level.
the annual impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles allows for the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible is less than its carrying amount. an entity may choose to perform the qualitative assessment or an entity may bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. if it is determined, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible is, more likely than not, less than its carrying value, the quantitative impairment test is required. when performing a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair value of our cable franchise rights primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment. when analyzing the fair values indicated under the discounted cash flow models, we also consider multiples of operating income before depreciation and amortization generated by the underlying assets, current market transactions and profitability information.
in 2015, we performed a qualitative assessment of our cable franchise rights. we considered various factors that would affect the estimated fair values of our cable franchise rights, including changes in our projected future cash flows associated with our cable communications segment; market transactions and macroeconomic conditions; and also the 8% increase in our market capitalization since we performed our 2014 quantitative assessment. in addition, we considered the results of our 2014 quantitative assessment, in which the estimated fair values of our franchise rights exceeded the carrying value in our three cable communications divisions by 26%, 42% and 50%, respectively. we also compared our weighted-average cost of capital in 2015 to that used in our 2014 quantitative assessment and it had remained relatively consistent. based on our 2015 qualitative assessment, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our franchise rights were higher than our carrying values and that the performance of a quantitative impairment test was not required.
since the adoption of the accounting guidance related to goodwill and intangible assets in 2002, we have not recorded any significant impairment charges to cable franchise rights as a result of our impairment testing. a future change in the unit of account could result in the recognition of an impairment charge.
we could also record impairment charges in the future if there are changes in long-term market conditions, in expected future operating results, or in federal or state regulations that prevent us from recovering the carrying value of these cable franchise rights. assumptions made about increased competition and economic conditions could also impact the results of any qualitative assessment and the valuations used in future annual quantitative impairment testing and result in a reduction in the fair values of our cable franchise rights.
film and television costs we capitalize film and television production costs, including direct costs, production overhead, print costs, development costs and interest. we amortize capitalized film and television production costs, including acquired libraries, and accrue costs associated with participation and residual payments to programming and production expenses. we generally record the amortization and the accrued costs using the individual film forecast computation method, which amortizes such costs using the ratio of the current period's revenue to estimated total remaining gross revenue from all sources ("ultimate revenue"). estimates of ultimate revenue have a significant impact on how quickly capitalized costs are amortized and, therefore, are updated regularly.
our estimates of ultimate revenue for films generally include revenue from all sources that are expected to be earned within 10 years from the date of a film's initial release. these estimates are based on the historical performance of similar content, as well as factors unique to the content itself. the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue for a film intended for theatrical release is the film's theatrical comcast 2015 annual report on form 10-k   68
performance, as subsequent revenue from the licensing and sale of a film has historically exhibited a high correlation to its theatrical performance. upon a film's release, our estimates of revenue from succeeding markets, including home entertainment and other distribution platforms, are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends.
with respect to television series or other owned television programming, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue is whether the series can be successfully licensed beyond its initial license. initial estimates of ultimate revenue are limited to the amount of revenue contracted for each episode under the initial license. once it is determined that a television series or other owned television programming can be licensed for subsequent platforms, revenue estimates for these platforms, such as u.s. and international syndication, home entertainment, and other distribution platforms, are included in ultimate revenue. revenue estimates for produced episodes include revenue expected to be earned within 10 years of delivery of the initial episode or, if still in production, 5 years from the delivery of the most recent episode, if later.
we capitalize the costs of programming content that we license but do not own, including rights to multiyear, live-event sports programming, at the earlier of when payments are made for the programming or when the license period begins and the content is available for use. we amortize capitalized programming costs as the associated programs are broadcast. we amortize multiyear, live-event sports programming rights using the ratio of the current period revenue to the estimated ultimate revenue or under the terms of the contract.
capitalized film and television costs, as well as stage play production costs, are subject to impairment testing when certain triggering events are identified. if the fair value of a production were to fall below its unamortized cost, we would record an adjustment for the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs exceed the production's fair value. the fair value assessment is generally based on estimated future discounted cash flows, which are supported by our internal forecasts. adjustments to capitalized film and stage play production costs of $42 million, $26 million and $167 million were recorded in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

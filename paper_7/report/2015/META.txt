item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in part ii, item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" of this annual report on form 10-k. in addition to our historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, particularly in part i, item 1a, "risk factors." for a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our user metrics, see the section entitled "limitations of key metrics and other data" in this annual report on form 10-k.
certain revenue information in the sections entitled "executive overview of full year 2015 results" and "-revenue-foreign exchange impact on revenue" is presented on a constant currency basis. this information is a non-gaap financial measure. to calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, we translated revenue for the fourth quarter of and full year 2015 using 2014 monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the u.s. dollar. this non-gaap financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap. this measure may be different from non-gaap financial measures used by other companies, limiting its usefulness for comparison purposes. moreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes, and investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results. we believe this non-gaap financial measure provides investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.
executive overview of full year 2015 results our key user metrics and financial results for 2015 are as follows:
user growth:
•   daily active users (daus) were 1.04 billion on average for december 2015, an increase of 17% year-over-year.
•   mobile daus were 934 million on average for december 2015, an increase of 25% year-over-year.
•   monthly active users (maus) were 1.59 billion as of december 31, 2015, an increase of 14% year-over-year.
•   mobile maus were 1.44 billion as of december 31, 2015, an increase of 21% year-over-year.
financial results:
•   revenue was $17.93 billion, up 44% year-over-year (or 53% year-over-year on a constant currency basis), and ad revenue was $17.08 billion, up 49% year-over-year (or 59% year-over-year on a constant currency basis).
•   total costs and expenses were $11.70 billion.
•   income from operations was $6.23 billion.
•   net income was $3.69 billion with diluted earnings per share of $1.29.
•   capital expenditures were $2.52 billion.
•   effective tax rate was 40%.
•   cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $18.43 billion as of december 31, 2015.
•   headcount was 12,691 as of december 31, 2015.
in 2015, we continued to make progress on our three main revenue growth priorities: (i) continuing to capitalize on the shift to mobile, (ii) growing the number of marketers using our ad products, and (iii) making our ads more relevant and effective through continued adoption of newer ad formats and tools for marketers.
in addition, we invested, and will continue to invest, across three priorities: (i) our core products and services to better serve our existing communities and businesses, (ii) our next generation of services, such as instagram, messenger and whatsapp, and (iii) our long-term innovation efforts, such as connectivity efforts, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence research. we expect these investments will continue to drive significant overall year-over-year expense growth compared to 2015.

trends in our user metrics the numbers for our key metrics, our daily active users (daus), mobile daus, maus, mobile maus, and average revenue per user (arpu), and certain other metrics such as mobile-only daus and mobile-only maus, do not include instagram or whatsapp users unless they would otherwise qualify as such users, respectively, based on their other activities on facebook. in addition, other user engagement metrics do not include instagram or whatsapp unless otherwise specifically stated.
trends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, the volume of payments transactions, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures.
•   daily active users (daus). we define a daily active user as a registered facebook user who logged in and visited facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our messenger application (and is also a registered facebook user), on a given day. we view daus, and daus as a percentage of maus, as measures of user engagement.
note: for purposes of reporting daus, maus, and arpu by geographic region, europe includes all users in russia and turkey and rest of world includes all users in africa, latin america, and the middle east.
33
worldwide daus increased 17% to 1.04 billion on average during december 2015 from 890 million during december 2014. we experienced growth in daus across major markets, including india, the united states, and brazil. overall growth in daus was driven by increased mobile usage of facebook, and the number of daus accessing facebook on personal computers decreased in december 2015, compared to the same period in 2014. we believe that use of facebook through personal computers will continue to decline in all regions.
•   mobile daus. we define a mobile dau as a user who accessed facebook via a mobile application or via mobile versions of our website such as m.facebook.com, whether on a mobile phone or tablet, or used our messenger application (and is also a registered facebook user) on a given day. we define a mobile-only dau as a user who accessed facebook solely through mobile applications or mobile versions of our website on a given day, whereas a mobile dau may have also accessed facebook on a personal computer on that day.
worldwide mobile daus increased 25% to 934 million on average during december 2015 from 745 million during december 2014. in all regions, an increasing number of our daus accessed facebook through mobile devices on average during december 2015, as compared to the same period during 2014, with users in india, brazil, and the united states representing key sources of mobile dau growth on average during december 2015. on average during december 2015, there were 789 million mobile-only daus, increasing 34% from 589 million mobile-only daus during the same period in 2014. the remaining mobile daus accessed facebook from both mobile devices and personal computers. we anticipate that growth in mobile users will continue to be the driver of our user growth for the foreseeable future.
34
•   monthly active users (maus). we define a monthly active user as a registered facebook user who logged in and visited facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our messenger application (and is also a registered facebook user), in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. maus are a measure of the size of our global active user community.
as of december 31, 2015, we had 1.59 billion maus, an increase of 14% from december 31, 2014. users in india, the united states, and brazil represented key sources of growth in 2015. overall growth in maus was driven by increased mobile usage of facebook, and the number of maus accessing facebook on personal computers decreased in december 2015, compared to the same period in 2014. we believe that use of facebook through personal computers will continue to decline in all regions.
•   mobile maus. we define a mobile mau as a user who accessed facebook via a mobile application or via mobile versions of our website such as m.facebook.com, whether on a mobile phone or tablet, or used our messenger application (and is also a registered facebook user) during the period of measurement. we define a mobile-only mau as a user who accessed facebook solely through mobile applications or mobile versions of our website during the period of measurement, whereas a mobile mau may have also accessed facebook on a personal computer during the period of measurement.
35
worldwide mobile maus increased 21% to 1.44 billion as of december 31, 2015 from 1.19 billion as of december 31, 2014. in all regions, an increasing number of our maus accessed facebook through mobile devices in 2015, as compared to the same period in 2014, with users in india, brazil, and the united states representing key sources of mobile mau growth in 2015. there were 823 million mobile-only maus as of december 31, 2015, increasing 56% from 526 million mobile-only maus during the same period in 2014. the remaining 619 million mobile maus accessed facebook from both mobile devices and personal computers during december 2015. we anticipate that growth in mobile users will continue to be the driver of our user growth for the foreseeable future.
36
trends in our monetization by user geography we calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered or virtual and digital goods are purchased. we define arpu as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of maus in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter. while arpu includes all sources of revenue, the number of maus used in this calculation only includes users of facebook and messenger as described in the definition of mau above. the geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates. our revenue and arpu in regions such as united states & canada and europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets. for example, arpu in 2015 in the united states & canada region was more than seven times higher than in the asia-pacific region.
note: our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. this allocation differs from our revenue by geography disclosure in our consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the location of the marketer or developer.
37
for 2015, worldwide arpu was $11.96, an increase of 27% from 2014. over this period, arpu increased by 45% in united states & canada, 23% in europe, 22% in asia-pacific, and 15% in rest of world. the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies from 2014 to 2015 had an unfavorable impact on the growth rate of our arpu outside the united states and canada region. in addition, user growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower arpu, such as asia-pacific and rest of world. we expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where arpu is relatively lower, such as asia-pacific and rest of world, such that worldwide arpu may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to arpu in any geographic region, or potentially decrease even if arpu increases in each geographic region.
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. our actual results could differ from these estimates.
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition for payments and other fees, income taxes, share-based compensation, loss contingencies, and business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. for further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see note 1 of our accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" of this annual report on form 10-k.
revenue recognition for payments and other fees we enable payments from people to purchase virtual and digital goods from developers. people can make payments on facebook by using debit and credit cards, paypal, mobile phone payments, gift cards, or other methods. we receive a fee from developers when a person engages in a payment transaction for the purchase of a virtual or digital good on the facebook website. the price of the virtual or digital good is a price that is solely determined by the developer. we remit to the developer an amount that is based on the total amount of transaction less the processing fee that we charge the developer for the service performed. our revenue is the net amount of the transaction representing our processing fee for the transaction. we record revenue on a net basis as we do not consider ourselves to be the principal in the sale of the virtual or digital good to the person. under gaap guidance related to reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent, the indicators used to determine whether an entity is a principal or an agent to a transaction are subject to judgment. we consider ourselves the agent to these transactions when we apply the indicators to our facts. should material subsequent changes in the substance or nature of the transactions with developers result in us being considered the principal in such sales, we would reflect the virtual and digital goods sale as revenue and the amounts paid to the developers as an associated cost.
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.
we record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. under this method, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized.
we recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. we make adjustments to these reserves when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results. the provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that we believe are appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.
38
share-based compensation we account for share-based employee compensation plans under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions in accordance with applicable accounting standards, which require all share-based payments to employees, including grants of stock options and restricted stock units (rsus), to be measured based on the grant date fair value of the awards, with the resulting expense generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award.
share-based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures in our consolidated statements of income and as such is recorded for only those share-based awards that we expect to vest. we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical forfeitures of equity awards and adjust the rate to reflect changes in facts and circumstances, if any. we will revise our estimated forfeiture rate if actual forfeitures differ from our initial estimates.
we have historically issued unvested restricted shares to employee stockholders of certain acquired companies. as these awards are generally subject to continued post-acquisition employment, we have accounted for them as post-acquisition share-based compensation expense. we recognize compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value of the common stock on a straight-line basis over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award.
loss contingencies we are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. we record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. we review these provisions at least quarterly and adjust these provisions accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.
we believe that the amount or estimable range of reasonably possible loss, will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies as of december 31, 2015. however, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. therefore, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period, could be materially adversely affected.
business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired users, acquired technology, and trade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives, and discount rates. management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. during the measurement period, which is one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.
we review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our single reporting unit below its carrying value. we evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. as of december 31, 2015, no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets has been identified.
acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. we evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. the evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. if such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. we have not recorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented.
in addition to the recoverability assessment, we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our finite-lived intangible assets. if we reduce the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance would be amortized over the revised estimated useful life.

components of results of operations revenue advertising. we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on facebook properties, including our mobile applications, and third-party affiliated websites or mobile applications. marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies, based on the number of clicks made by people, the number of actions taken by people, or the number of impressions delivered. we recognize revenue from the delivery of click-based ads in the period in which a person clicks on the content, and action-based ads in the period in which a person takes the action the marketer contracted for. we recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to people. the number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products. we calculate price per ad as total ad revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression, click, or action. for advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the primary obligor, we recognize revenue on a net basis.
payments and other fees. we enable payments from people to purchase virtual and digital goods from our developers. people can transact and make payments on the facebook website by using debit and credit cards, paypal, mobile phone payments, gift cards, or other methods. we receive a fee from developers when people make purchases in these applications using our payments infrastructure. we recognize revenue net of amounts remitted to our developers. we have mandated the use of our payments infrastructure for game applications on facebook, and fees related to payments are generated almost exclusively from games. our other fees revenue, which has not been significant in recent periods, consists primarily of revenue from our ad serving and measurement products and the delivery of virtual reality platform devices.
cost of revenue and operating expenses cost of revenue. our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. these include expenses related to the operation of our data centers, such as facility and server equipment depreciation, energy and bandwidth costs, and salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams. cost of revenue also includes credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions, amortization of intangible assets, costs associated with data partner arrangements, and cost of virtual reality platform device inventory sold.
research and development. research and development expenses consist primarily of share-based compensation, salaries, and benefits for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for building new products as well as improving existing products. we expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred.
marketing and sales. our marketing and sales expenses consist of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development, and customer service functions. our marketing and sales expenses also include marketing and promotional expenditures, as well as amortization of intangible assets.
general and administrative. our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for certain of our executives as well as our legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrative employees. in addition, general and administrative expenses include professional and legal services. general and administrative expenses also include depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets we have acquired.

2015 compared to 2014. revenue in 2015 increased $5.46 billion, or 44% compared to 2014. the increase was primarily due to an increase in advertising revenue.
the most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads in news feed on mobile devices. in 2015, we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 77% of total advertising revenue, as compared with approximately 65% in 2014. factors that influenced our mobile advertising revenue growth in 2015 included (i) an increase in demand for our ad inventory, in part driven by an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on facebook, (ii) an increase in mobile user growth and engagement, and (iii) an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed in news feed, as well as the quality, relevance, and performance of those ads.
in 2015 compared to 2014, the average price per ad increased by 140% and the number of ads delivered decreased by 38%. the increase in average price per ad was driven by a product change related to certain non-news feed ads during the third quarter of 2014, which decreased the number of ads displayed but increased the prominence of each ad. average price per ad was also driven by a mix shift towards a greater percentage of our ads being shown in news feed. the reduction in ads delivered was driven by factors including the product change described above as well as the shift in usage towards mobile devices where people are shown fewer ads as compared to personal computers.
advertising revenue in the fourth quarter of 2015 increased 57% compared to the same period in 2014. the increase in advertising revenue in the fourth quarter of 2015 was driven by the same factors that drove 2015 annual advertising revenue growth, primarily an increase in revenue from ads in news feed on mobile devices. for the fourth quarter of 2015, we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 80% of total advertising revenue, as compared with 69% in the same period in 2014.
advertising spending is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year. we believe that this seasonality in advertising spending affects our quarterly results, which generally reflect significant growth in advertising revenue between the third and fourth quarters and a decline in advertising spending between the fourth and subsequent first quarters. for instance, our advertising revenue increased 31%, 22%, and 30% between the third and fourth quarters of 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, while advertising revenue for the first quarters of 2015 and 2014 declined 8% and 3% compared to the fourth quarters of 2014 and 2013, respectively.
payments and other fees revenue in 2015 decreased $125 million, or 13%, compared to 2014. the decrease in payments and other fees revenue was a result of decreased payments revenue from games played on personal computers, partially offset by an increase in other fees revenue related to acquisitions closed in the second half of 2014.
payments and other fees revenue in the fourth quarter of 2015 decreased $53 million, or 21%, compared to the same period in 2014.
42
payments and other fees revenue is currently based predominantly on payments revenue from games played on personal computers. as users shift their usage to mobile devices, facebook usage on personal computers has been declining and will continue to decline in the future, resulting in a decline in our payments revenue.
2014 compared to 2013. revenue in 2014 increased $4.59 billion, or 58% compared to 2013. the increase was due primarily to a 65% increase in advertising revenue during 2014 as compared to 2013.
the most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads in news feed on both mobile devices and personal computers. news feed ads are displayed more prominently, have significantly higher levels of engagement and a higher price per ad relative to our other ad placements. in 2014, we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 65% of total advertising revenue, as compared with 45% in 2013. other factors that influenced our advertising revenue growth in 2014 included (i) an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on facebook, which we believe increased demand for our ad inventory, (ii) other product changes to increase the value and performance of our ads, and (iii) an increase in user growth and engagement.
in 2014 compared to 2013, the average price per ad increased by 173% and the number of ads delivered decreased by 40%. the increase in average price per ad was driven by a product change related to certain non-news feed ads during the third quarter of 2014, which decreased the number of ads displayed but increased the prominence of each ad. average price per ad was also driven by a mix shift towards a greater percentage of our ads being shown in news feed. the reduction in ads delivered was driven by factors including the product change described above as well as the shift in usage towards mobile devices where people are shown fewer ads as compared to personal computers.
payments and other fees revenue in 2014 increased $88 million, or 10%, compared to 2013. the increase in payments and other fees revenue is a result of increased revenue from our ad serving and measurement products and the delivery of virtual reality platform devices.
no customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013.
foreign exchange impact on revenue the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies (primarily the euro) from the fourth quarter of and full year 2014 to the same periods in 2015 had an unfavorable impact on our revenue. if we had translated revenue for the fourth quarter of and full year 2015 using 2014 monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the u.s. dollar, our total revenue would have been $6.16 billion and $19.11 billion, respectively, and our advertising revenue would have been $5.96 billion and $18.26 billion, respectively. using these constant rates, both revenue and advertising revenue would have been $322 million and $1.19 billion higher than actual revenue and advertising revenue for the fourth quarter of and full year 2015, respectively.
there were no material foreign exchange impacts on our revenue and advertising revenue from the full year 2013 to the same period in 2014.

2015 compared to 2014. cost of revenue in 2015 increased $714 million, or 33%, compared to 2014. the increase was primarily due to an increase in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure of $480 million, compared to 2014. amortization of our intangible assets in 2015 also increased $100 million compared to 2014, mostly due to the full year impact of acquisitions completed in the second half of 2014.
2014 compared to 2013. cost of revenue in 2014 increased $278 million, or 15%, compared to 2013. the increase was primarily due to operational expenses related to our data center and technical infrastructure and increased amortization of our intangible assets. these increases were partially offset by items related to data center lease abandonment: we reversed $34 million of lease abandonment expense in 2014 due to our decision to re-occupy and utilize a previously exited data center, compared to a recognition of $117 million of lease abandonment expense in 2013.
43
in 2016, we anticipate that the cost of revenue will increase as we expand our data center capacity and technical infrastructure to support user growth, increased user engagement, and the delivery of new products and services.

2015 compared to 2014. research and development expenses in 2015 increased $2.15 billion, or 81%, compared to 2014. the majority of the increase was due to an increase in share-based compensation expense of $1.02 billion compared to 2014, which reflected the full year impact of share-based compensation related to the acquisitions completed in the second half of 2014. in addition, other payroll and benefits expense increased as a result of a 43% growth in employee headcount from december 31, 2014 to december 31, 2015 in engineering and other technical functions.
2014 compared to 2013. research and development expenses in 2014 increased $1.25 billion, or 88%, compared to 2013. the increase was primarily due to an increase of $724 million in share-based compensation expense compared to 2013, and an increase in other payroll and benefits expense resulting from a 48% growth in employee headcount from december 31, 2013 to december 31, 2014 in engineering and other technical functions. share-based compensation expense also increased due to the acquisitions we completed in 2014.
in 2016, we plan to continue hiring software engineers and other technical employees and increasing our investment to support our research and development initiatives.

2015 compared to 2014. our provision for income taxes in 2015 increased $536 million, or 27%, compared to 2014, primarily due to an increase in income before provision for income taxes. our effective tax rate in 2015 remained flat, compared to 2014.
our effective tax rate differs from the u.s. statutory rate primarily because of the impact of acquiring intellectual property and integrating it into our business, non-deductible share-based compensation, operations in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the u.s., and tax research credits. our effective tax rate in the future will depend on the portion of our profits earned within and outside the united states, which will also be affected by our methodologies for valuing our intellectual property and intercompany transactions. our future effective tax rate will also be affected by the timing, size, and integration of any acquisitions we make.
on july 27, 2015, the united states tax court issued an opinion in altera corp. v. commissioner related to the treatment of share-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement. this opinion concluded that related parties in a cost-sharing arrangement are not required to share share-based compensation. a final decision was issued by the tax court, however, this decision may be appealed by the commissioner. the impact of the conclusions stated by the tax court in its opinion was not material to our consolidated financial statements.

2014 compared to 2013. our provision for income taxes in 2014 increased $716 million, or 57%, compared to 2013, primarily due to an increase in income before provision for income taxes. our effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate due to non-deductible share-based compensation, operations in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the u.s., and tax research credits. our effective tax rate decreased primarily due to a change in our geographic mix of pre-tax income.

our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities consist primarily of cash on deposit with banks, investments in money market funds, and investments in u.s. government securities, u.s. government agency securities, and corporate debt securities. cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $18.43 billion as of december 31, 2015, an increase of $7.24 billion from december 31, 2014, primarily due to $8.60 billion of cash generated from operations and $1.72 billion in excess tax benefits from share-based award activity, partially offset by $2.52 billion for purchases of property and equipment and $313 million for acquisitions of businesses and other assets.
cash paid for income taxes (net of refunds) was $270 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. as of december 31, 2015, our federal net operating loss carryforward was $2.70 billion, although we anticipate only a relatively small portion of this will be available to offset our federal taxable income in 2016. as of december 31, 2015, we had $1.08 billion of federal tax credits, substantially all of which will be available to offset our federal tax liabilities in 2016. we expect that the amount of cash paid for income taxes to significantly increase in 2016.
in august 2013, we entered into a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (2013 revolving credit facility) that allows us to borrow up to $6.5 billion to fund working capital and general corporate purposes with interest payable on the borrowed amounts set at libor plus 1.0%, as well as an annual commitment fee of 0.10% on the daily undrawn balance of the facility. we paid origination fees at closing of the 2013 revolving credit facility, which fees are being amortized over the term of the facility. any amounts outstanding under this facility will be due and payable on august 15, 2018. as of december 31, 2015, no amounts had been drawn down and we were in compliance with the covenants under this credit facility.
as of december 31, 2015, $1.90 billion of the $18.43 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. substantially all of these funds are in jurisdictions for which we are indefinitely reinvesting the earnings of the local subsidiary. we have provided residual taxes in jurisdictions where we do not intend to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of the local subsidiary, however the amount of taxes provided has been insignificant.
we currently anticipate that our available funds, credit facility, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future.

cash provided by operating activities cash flow from operating activities during 2015, mostly consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as share-based compensation expense of $2.96 billion and total depreciation and amortization of $1.95 billion. the increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2015 compared to 2014, was primarily due to an increase in net income, as adjusted for share-based compensation expense, and higher income tax payable as of december 31, 2015 compared to 2014.
cash flow from operating activities during 2014, primarily consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as share-based compensation expense of $1.79 billion and total depreciation and amortization of $1.24 billion. the cash flow from operating activities during 2014 compared to 2013 increased mainly due to an increase in net income of $1.44 billion, as adjusted for certain non-cash items described above, partially offset by a decrease in income tax refunds of $415 million.
cash flow from operating activities during 2013, primarily consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as depreciation and amortization of $1.01 billion and share-based compensation expense of $906 million, and an increase in other liabilities related to uncertain tax positions. the cash flow from operating activities during 2013 compared to 2012 increased mainly due to an increase in net income of $1.45 billion and uncertain tax position of $786 million. in addition, we received income tax refunds of $421 million in 2013.
cash used in investing activities cash used in investing activities was $9.43 billion during 2015, primarily due to $6.70 billion for net purchases of marketable securities and $2.52 billion for capital expenditures as we continued to invest in servers, data centers, network infrastructure, and office buildings. the increase in cash used in investing activities during 2015 compared to 2014 was mainly due to increases in net purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by a decrease in acquisitions of businesses and purchases of intangible assets.
cash used in investing activities during 2014 primarily resulted from $4.98 billion for the acquisition of businesses and $1.83 billion for capital expenditures related to network infrastructure and the construction of data centers and office buildings, partially offset by $1.24 billion for the net sales and maturities of marketable securities. the increase in cash used in investing activities during 2014 compared to 2013 was mainly due to increases in acquisitions of businesses and purchases of intangible assets, and capital expenditures, partially offset by net sales of marketable securities.
cash used in investing activities during 2013 primarily resulted from $1.36 billion for capital expenditures related to the purchase of servers, network infrastructure, and the construction of data centers, as well as $882 million for the net purchase of marketable securities and $368 million for the acquisition of businesses and other assets, such as patents. the decrease in cash used in investing activities during 2013 compared to 2012 was mainly due to decreases in the purchase of marketable securities and the acquisitions of businesses and purchases of intangible assets.
we anticipate making capital expenditures in 2016 of approximately $4.0 billion to $4.5 billion.
cash provided by (used in) financing activities cash flow from financing activities during 2015, mostly consisted of excess tax benefit from share-based award activity and principal payments on capital lease obligations. the increase in cash provided by financing activities was mostly due to lower principal payments related to our capital lease transactions and lower tax payments related to the net share settlement, partially offset by a decrease of excess tax benefit from share-based award activity.
cash provided by financing activities during 2014 was $1.57 billion, which primarily resulted from $1.87 billion of excess tax benefit from share-based award activity, partially offset by $243 million of payments related to our capital lease transactions, and $73 million of tax payments related to net share settlement resulting mainly from the vested merger consideration of an acquisition.
cash used in financing activities during 2013 was $667 million, which primarily resulted from $1.50 billion for repayment of debt and $889 million of tax payments related to the net share settlement, partially offset by $1.48 billion in net proceeds from the completion of our follow-on equity offering in december 2013.
off-balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2015.

(1)   financing obligation - building in progress - leased facility represents our commitment to lease an entire office building in london, united kingdom, that is currently under construction. as of december 31, 2015, $62 million of the total obligation was recorded as a liability and is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. see note 10 of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to this financing obligation.
(2)   other contractual commitments primarily relate to network infrastructure for our data center operations and, to a lesser extent, construction commitments related to our data center sites.
in addition, our other liabilities include $2.46 billion related to uncertain tax positions as of december 31, 2015. due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months. as a result, this amount is not included in the above contractual obligations table.
contingencies we are involved in claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and other legal proceedings. we record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount can be reasonably estimated. significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.
see note 10 of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" and part i, item 3, "legal proceedings" of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding these contingencies.
recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncement in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued accounting standards update no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606) (asu 2014-09), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. in august 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-14, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606): deferral of the effective date, which delays the effective date of asu 2014-09 by one year. the fasb also agreed to allow entities to choose to adopt the standard as of the original effective date. as such, the updated standard will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2018, with the option to adopt it in the first quarter of 2017. we are still evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
in november 2015, the fasb issued accounting standards update no. 2015-17, income taxes (topic 740): balance sheet classification of deferred taxes (asu 2015-17), which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. the updated standard is effective for us beginning on january 1, 2017 with early application permitted as of the beginning of any interim or annual reporting period. we early adopted this standard retrospectively, and reclassified our current deferred tax assets to noncurrent deferred tax assets for all periods presented. as a result of the reclassifications, certain noncurrent deferred tax liabilities were netted with noncurrent deferred tax assets.

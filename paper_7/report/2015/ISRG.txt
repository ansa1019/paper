item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview open surgery remains the predominant form of surgery and is used in almost every area of the body. however, the large incisions required for open surgery create trauma to patients, typically resulting in longer hospitalization and recovery times, increased hospitalization costs, and additional pain and suffering relative to minimally invasive surgery ("mis"), where mis is available. for over two and a half decades, mis has reduced trauma to patients by allowing selected surgeries to be performed through small ports rather than large incisions. mis has been widely adopted for certain surgical procedures, but has not yet been widely adopted for reconstructive surgeries.
da vinci surgical systems enable surgeons to extend the benefits of mis to many patients who would otherwise undergo a more invasive surgery by using computational, robotic and imaging technologies to overcome many of the limitations of conventional mis. surgeons using a da vinci surgical system operate while seated comfortably at a console viewing a three dimensional ("3-d") representation of a high definition ("hd") image of the surgical field. this immersive visualization connects surgeons to the surgical field and their instruments. while seated at the console, the surgeon manipulates instrument controls in a natural manner, similar to the open surgery technique. our technology is designed to provide surgeons with a range of motion of mis instruments in the surgical field analogous to the motions of a human wrist, while filtering out the tremor inherent in a surgeon's hand. in designing our products, we focus on making our technology easy and safe to use.
our products fall into four broad categories - the da vinci surgical systems, insite and firefly fluorescence imaging systems ("firefly"), instruments and accessories (e.g., endowrist, endowrist one vessel sealer, da vinci single-site and endowrist stapler), and training technologies. we have commercialized four generations of da vinci surgical systems: the first is our da vinci standard surgical system, commercialized in 1999, the second is our da vinci s surgical system, commercialized in 2006, the third is our da vinci si surgical system, commercialized in 2009, and the fourth is our da vinci xi surgical system, commercialized in the second quarter of 2014. systems include a surgeon's console (or consoles), imaging electronics, a patient-side cart, and computational hardware and software.
we offer over 65 different multiport da vinci instruments enabling surgeons' flexibility in choosing the types of tools needed in a particular surgery. these multiport instruments are generally robotically controlled versions of surgical tools that surgeons would use in either open or laparoscopic surgery. we offer single-site instruments for use with the da vinci si surgical system in cholecystectomy, benign hysterectomy, and salpingo-oophorectomy procedures. single-site instruments enable surgeons to also perform surgery through a single port via the patient's belly button, resulting in the potential for virtually scarless results. for the da vinci si and da vinci xi platforms, we offer advanced energy instrumentation, including the endowrist one vessel sealer, and endowrist stapler 45, to provide surgeons with sophisticated, computer-aided tools to precisely and efficiently interact with tissue.
training technologies include our da vinci skills simulator, da vinci connect remote case observation and mentoring tool, and our dual console for use in surgeon proctoring and collaborative surgery.
procedures we model patient value as equal to procedure efficacy / invasiveness. in this equation procedure efficacy is defined as a measure of the success of the surgery in resolving the underlying disease and invasiveness is defined as a measure of patient pain and disruption of regular activities. when the patient value of a da vinci procedure is greater than that of alternative treatment options, patients may benefit from seeking out surgeons and hospitals that offer da vinci surgery, which could potentially result in a local market share shift. da vinci procedure adoption occurs procedure by procedure, market by market, and is driven by the relative patient value and total treatment costs of da vinci procedures as compared to alternative treatment options for the same disease state or condition.
worldwide procedures da vinci systems and instruments are regulated independently in various countries and regions of the world. the discussion of indications for use and representative or target procedures is intended solely to provide an understanding of the market for da vinci products but is not intended to promote for sale or use any intuitive surgical product outside of its licensed or cleared labeling and indications for use.
the adoption of da vinci surgery has the potential to grow for those procedures that offer greater patient value than non-da vinci alternatives, within the prevailing economics of healthcare providers. da vinci surgical systems are used primarily in gynecologic surgery, general surgery, urologic surgery, cardiothoracic surgery, and head and neck surgery. we focus our organization and investments on developing, marketing, and training for those products and procedures where da vinci can bring greater patient value relative to alternative treatment options and/or economic benefit to health care providers. target procedures in gynecology include da vinci hysterectomy ("dvh"), for both cancer and benign procedures, and sacrocolpopexy. target procedures in general surgery include hernia repair (both ventral and inguinal), colorectal procedures, and cholecystectomy. target procedures in urology
37
include da vinci prostatectomy ("dvp") and partial nephrectomy. in cardiothoracic surgery, target procedures include da vinci lobectomy and da vinci mitral valve repair. in head and neck surgery, target procedures include certain procedures resecting benign and malignant tumors classified as t1 and t2. not all the indications, procedures, or products described may be available in a given country or region or on all generations of da vinci surgical systems. patients need to consult the product labeling in a specific country and for each product in order to determine the actual authorized uses, as well as important limitations, restrictions, or contraindications.
in 2015, approximately 652,000 surgical procedures were performed with the da vinci surgical system, compared with approximately 570,000 and 523,000 procedures performed in 2014 and 2013, respectively. the growth in our overall procedure volume in 2015 was driven by growth in u.s. general surgery procedures and worldwide urologic procedures.
u.s. procedures overall u.s. procedure volume grew to approximately 499,000 in 2015, compared with approximately 449,000 in 2014, and approximately 422,000 in 2013. gynecology is our largest u.s. surgical specialty and the procedure volume was approximately 238,000 in 2015, compared with 235,000 in 2014 and 240,000 in 2013. general surgery is our second largest and fastest growing specialty in the u.s. with procedure volume that grew to approximately 140,000 in 2015, compared with approximately 107,000 in 2014 and 81,000 in 2013. u.s. urology procedure volume was approximately 102,000 in 2015, compared with approximately 91,000 in 2014, and 85,000 in 2013.
procedures outside of the u.s.
overall procedures outside of the u.s. ("ous") grew to approximately 153,000 in 2015, compared with approximately 121,000 in 2014 and approximately 101,000 in 2013. ous procedure growth accelerated in 2015, reflecting higher asian procedure volumes, most notably in china, japan, and south korea. procedure volume grew at a similar rate in 2015 as compared with 2014. procedure growth in most ous markets was driven largely by dvp volume, which grew to approximately 79,000 in 2015, compared with approximately 65,000 in 2014, and approximately 56,000 in 2013. partial nephrectomy, general surgery, and gynecologic oncology procedures also contributed to ous procedure growth.
see recent business events and trends for further discussion on u.s. and ous procedures.
business model we generate revenue from both the initial capital sales of da vinci surgical systems and from subsequent sales of instruments, accessories and service, as recurring revenue. the da vinci surgical system generally sells for approximately between $0.6 million and $2.5 million, depending upon configuration and geography, and represents a significant capital equipment investment for our customers. we generate recurring revenue as our customers purchase our endowrist and single-site instrument and accessory products used in performing procedures with the da vinci surgical system. our instruments and accessories have a limited life and will either expire or wear out as they are used in surgery, at which point they are replaced. also, we generate recurring revenue from ongoing system service. we typically enter into service contracts at the time systems are sold at an annual rate of approximately $100,000 to $170,000 per year, depending upon the configuration of the underlying system and composition of the services offered under the contract. these service contracts have generally been renewed at the end of the initial contractual service periods.
recurring revenue has generally grown at a faster rate than system revenue in the last few fiscal years. recurring revenue increased to $1.7 billion, or 70% of total revenue in 2015, compared with $1.5 billion, or 70% of total revenue in 2014 and $1.4 billion, or 63% of total revenue in 2013. the growth of recurring revenue and its increasing proportion of total revenue largely reflect continued procedure adoption on a growing base of installed da vinci surgical systems. the installed base of da vinci surgical systems has grown to approximately 3,597 at december 31, 2015, compared with 3,266 at december 31, 2014, and 2,966 at december 31, 2013.
we provide our products through direct sales organizations in the u.s., japan, south korea, and europe, excluding spain, portugal, italy, greece, and eastern european countries. in the remainder of our ous markets, we provide our products through distributors. in june 2014, we terminated our distribution relationship with and reacquired the distribution rights from adachi co., ltd., our former japanese distributor, and now market, sell, and service our products directly to end customers in japan.
intuitive surgical da vinci system leasing since 2013, we have entered into sales-type and operating lease arrangements directly with certain qualified customers as a way to offer customers flexibility in how they acquire da vinci systems and expand da vinci surgery availability while leveraging our balance sheet. the leases generally have commercially competitive terms as compared with other third party entities that offer equipment leasing. we include both operating and sales-type leases in our system shipment and installed base disclosures. we exclude operating leases from our system average selling prices computations.
in the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, we shipped 63, 41, and 6 systems under lease arrangements, respectively, of which 43, 14, and 0 were classified as operating leases, respectively. generally, our operating leases provide our
38
customers with the right to purchase the leased systems sometime during or at the end of the lease term. we believe this has been an effective program and has been well received by our customers and we plan to continue with our system leasing program in the future. operating lease revenue for the years ended december 31, 2015, and 2014, was $7.0 million and $1.3 million, respectively. no operating lease revenue was recognized for the year ended december 31, 2013. as of december 31, 2015, 49 da vinci systems were installed at customers under operating lease arrangements.
regulatory activities clearances and approvals we have obtained the clearances required to market our multiport products associated with the first three generations of our da vinci surgical systems (standard, s, and si systems) for our targeted surgical specialties within the u.s. and most of europe. in february 2013, we received fda clearance to market our single-site instruments for benign hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy procedures. in september 2014, we received fda clearance to market the wristed version of our single-site needle driver product for use in benign hysterectomy, cholecystectomy, and salpingo-oophorectomy procedures.
in march 2014, we received fda clearance to market our da vinci xi surgical system in the u.s., our fourth generation da vinci surgical system (see the complete description of the da vinci xi surgical system in the new product introductions section). in june 2014, we received ce mark clearance for our da vinci xi surgical system in europe. in october 2014, we received regulatory clearance for our da vinci xi surgical system in south korea. in march 2015, we received regulatory clearance for the da vinci xi surgical system in japan. the regulatory status of the da vinci xi surgical system in other ous markets varies by country.
we also received fda clearance on an initial set of instruments for the xi surgical system with the initial launch of the system in april 2014.  later in 2014, we received fda clearances for xi versions of our endowrist one vessel sealer, firefly, and endowrist stapler 45.  in the second quarter of 2015, we received fda clearance for an additional set of da vinci xi instruments.  in june 2015, we received ce mark clearance for our integrated table motion product in europe (see the complete description of the da vinci xi integrated table motion in the new product introductions section). we received fda clearance for the integrated table motion product in january 2016. we filed for fda 510(k) clearances in the u.s. for the single-site instruments and the 30mm endowrist stapler products for the da vinci xi surgical system in august 2015 (see the complete description of the endowrist stapler 30 in the new product introductions section). in the future, we plan to apply for additional clearances to expand the da vinci xi platform product and feature set, including the da vinci single port surgical system, as described below.
in april 2014, we received fda clearance to market our da vinci single port surgical system in the u.s. for single-port urologic surgeries. we are in the process of modifying the da vinci single port surgical system to be compatible with the da vinci xi surgical system. we plan to seek additional fda clearance(s) for the da vinci single port surgical system for procedure(s) in which a single small entry point to the body and parallel delivery of instruments is important. such surgeries could include those performed through a natural orifice like the mouth for head and neck procedures or those performed through a single skin incision. we anticipate increased clinical evaluation of da vinci single port surgical system in 2016, particularly in transoral and transabdominal applications.
we obtained approval from the japanese ministry of health, labor, and welfare ("mhlw") for our da vinci si surgical system in october 2012 and for our da vinci xi surgical system in march 2015. effective april 2012, we obtained national reimbursement for dvp procedures in japan, our only broadly reimbursed procedure to date. we are currently seeking reimbursement for additional procedures through the mhlw's senshin iryo processes as well as alternative reimbursement processes. our senshin iryo approvals require in-country clinical data and are considered for reimbursed status in april of even numbered years. japanese surgeons have submitted clinical data for consideration of partial nephrectomy reimbursement in the april 2016 cycle. there can be no assurance that we will gain additional senshin iryo reimbursements for the procedures or at the times we have targeted. we are continuing our discussions with stakeholders concerning the reimbursement for several other procedures; however inclusion of other procedures in reimbursement guidelines in 2016 is unlikely. if we are not successful in obtaining additional regulatory clearances, importation licenses, and adequate procedure reimbursements for future products and procedures, then the demand for our products in japan could be limited.
fda inspections during october 2015, the fda conducted a routine inspection at our sunnyvale facilities. the scope of the inspection included general surveillance in the form of a quality system inspection technique ("qsit") and follow-up on previous observations identified in the form fda 483 that was issued in 2014. no observations were communicated to us at the close of the october audit or in the final establishment inspection report ("eir") received from the fda in december of 2015.

recalls and corrections medical device companies have regulatory obligations to correct or remove medical devices in the field that could pose a risk to health. the definition of "recalls and corrections" is expansive and includes repair, replacement, inspections, re-labeling and issuance of new, added or reinforcement of instructions for use and training when such actions are taken for specific reasons of safety or compliance. these field actions require stringent documentation, reporting and monitoring worldwide. there are other actions which a medical device manufacturer may take in the field without reporting, including routine servicing, the introduction of new products, and new indications for use and stock rotations.
as we determine whether a field action is reportable in any regulatory jurisdiction, we prepare and submit notifications to the appropriate regulatory agency for the particular jurisdiction. in general, upon submitting required notifications to regulators regarding a field action which is a recall or correction, we will notify customers regarding the field action, provide any additional documentation required in their national language, and arrange, as required, return or replacement of the affected product or a field service visit to perform the correction. in addition, regulators can require the expansion, reclassification, or change in scope and language of the field action. field actions can result in adverse effects on our business, including damage to reputation, delays by customers of purchase decisions, reduction or stoppage of use of installed systems, and reduced revenue as well as increased expenses to complete field actions.
in september 2014, we stopped shipping the endowrist stapler 45 for the da vinci si surgical system and advised our customers to suspend use. while the observed failure rate in the field was low at 0.023%, based on the total number of staple fires, we believe that immediately suspending use was the best course of action in the interest of patients. our investigation of the three failed endowrist staplers uncovered two separate failure modes in the clamp mechanism: 1) a component failure in two instruments and 2) an assembly error in one instrument. based on these findings, in december 2014, we voluntarily initiated a field recall related to the endowrist stapler 45 instrument for the da vinci si surgical system. we have refined the relevant design elements and manufacturing processes to address these failure modes and began shipping replacement instruments in early 2015.
in march 2015, we issued a safety notice regarding certain equipment drapes that are used to cover a variety of surgical and non-surgical equipment in the clinical setting, advising our customers to inspect the drapes for cloudy or waxy appearances and for potential tears prior to use, and to return affected drapes. we are now shipping the replacement version of the drape products.
certain outcomes from any of the above regulatory activities may have a material adverse effect on our business, including damage to reputation, delays by customers of purchase decisions, reduction or stoppage of the use of our installed systems, and reduced revenue as well as increased expenses.

recent business events and trends procedures overall. during the year ended december 31, 2015, total da vinci procedures grew approximately 14% compared with 9% for the year ended december 31, 2014. u.s. procedure growth during the year ended december 31, 2015 was approximately 11%, compared with approximately 6% for the year ended december 31, 2014. the higher 2015 u.s. procedure growth was largely attributable to growth in general surgery procedures, most notably hernia repair and colorectal procedures, growth in dvp, and in contrast to the unfavorable impact of transitional issues associated with the implementation of the affordable care act had on our procedure growth in early 2014.
procedure volume ous for the year ended december 31, 2015, grew approximately 26% compared with approximately 20% growth for the year ended december 31, 2014, driven by continued growth in dvp and earlier stage growth in kidney cancer, colorectal, and gynecologic oncology procedures.
the higher 2015 ous procedure growth rate reflects increased da vinci adoption in asian markets, including china, japan, and south korea. while we are encouraged by procedure adoption in china, future system placements and our ability to sustain procedure growth are dependent on obtaining importation authorizations and hospitals completing the central purchasing tender under the authorization, the most recent of which expired at the end of 2015. the timing and magnitude of future authorizations, which may enable system placements in 2016 and beyond, is not certain. in japan, procedure growth rates are likely to be paced by the timing of procedure reimbursement approvals for procedures in addition to dvp.
u.s. gynecology. gynecology is our largest u.s. surgical specialty and the procedure volume was approximately 238,000 in 2015, compared with 235,000 in 2014 and 240,000 in 2013. our growth until 2013 was driven by adoption of dvh, our highest volume procedure, and other gynecologic procedures, including sacrocolpopexy and myomectomy largely resulting from capturing market share from open surgery techniques for these procedures. u.s. gynecologic procedure growth slowed significantly in 2013 and declined by approximately 2% in 2014 compared with 2013. we believe that u.s. benign gynecologic procedure volume was pressured by a number of macro factors including, but not limited to, larger patient deductibles and co-pays associated with the affordable care act, a trend by payers toward encouraging conservative disease management, and fda actions regarding the use of power morcellation in uterine surgeries, which mostly impacted da vinci myomectomy procedures (see more detailed description of the fda actions concerning morcellation below). u.s. gynecologic procedures grew approximately 1% in 2015, as compared with 2014. minimally invasive surgery is presently approaching 80% penetration of the u.s. benign hysterectomy market, causing the rate of migration from open surgeries to minimally invasive surgeries to slow. combined with the dispersion of the remaining open procedures among hospitals and surgeons, we believe the number of da vinci hysterectomies over the past two years has moved roughly in-line with the overall surgical market.
we believe that an increasing portion of dvh procedures with uncertain oncologic characteristics are being referred to gynecologic oncologists making it increasingly difficult to distinguish between dvh for cancer and dvh for benign conditions. a high proportion of gynecologic oncologists utilize the da vinci surgical systems to perform procedures which may account for the slight increase in total dvh procedures in 2015. based on reporting by our customers, dvh procedure volumes were approximately 196,000, 191,000, and 191,000 in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
u.s. general surgery. general surgery is our second largest and fastest growing specialty in the u.s. with procedure volume that grew to approximately 140,000 in 2015, compared with approximately 107,000 in 2014, and 81,000 in 2013. growth through 2013 was driven by rapid adoption of da vinci cholecystectomies, the first procedure to be fda-cleared for single-site surgery, and earlier stage growth in low anterior resections, colon procedures, and several other general surgery procedures. for the year ended 2014, u.s. general surgery procedures grew by approximately 32%, with growth shifting from cholecystectomy to hernia repair, colorectal resections, and other general surgery procedures. this trend has continued in 2015 with overall general surgery growth of approximately 31%. ventral and inguinal hernia, combined, contributed the most to 2015 general surgery growth, although other categories like colorectal, bariatric, foregut, and other procedures also contributed to the procedure growth.
we believe that growth in da vinci hernia repair reflects improved clinical outcomes within certain patient populations, as well as potential cost benefits relative to certain alternative treatments. while we believe hernia repair procedures represent a significant opportunity with the potential to drive growth in future periods, given the differences in complexity among hernia patient populations, it is difficult to estimate the timing of and to what degree da vinci hernia repair procedure volume will grow in the future. we expect a large portion of hernia repairs will continue to be performed in different modalities of surgery.
in december 2011, we received fda clearance for single-site cholecystectomy, our first procedure cleared for single-site instruments. da vinci cholecystectomies are performed with either single-site instruments or multiport instruments. while we believe da vinci cholecystectomies provide meaningful value for a segment of the patient and surgeon population, it is a lower complexity procedure which can generally be executed in a minimally invasive manner via multiport laparoscopy and has lower reimbursement rates than more complex procedures. for these reasons, it is difficult to estimate to what degree or timing that we
41
may capture these procedures. during 2014, total u.s. cholecystectomies grew at a lower rate than in previous years, and modestly declined in 2015. declines in single-site cholecystectomy were partially offset by higher multiport cholecystectomy volumes.
adoption of colorectal procedures, which includes several underlying procedures including low anterior resections for rectal cancers and certain colon procedures for benign and cancer conditions, has been ongoing for several years, and is supported by recently launched technologies such as the da vinci xi surgical system, endowrist stapler, and endowrist vessel sealer.
dvp. u.s. dvp is the largest urology procedure in the u.s. with 66,000 dvps performed in 2015, compared with 60,000 in 2014, and 58,000 in 2013. we believe the 2011 u.s. preventive services task force ("usptf") recommendation against prostate-specific antigen (("psa") screening has impacted our u.s. dvp procedure volumes, as well as caused changes in treatment patterns for low risk prostate cancer away from definitive treatment, and contributed to an approximate 6% decline in our dvp business in 2013. after continuing to decline during the first half of 2014, u.s. dvp returned to growth during the second half of 2014 and accelerated to approximately 11% growth in 2015.
as the u.s. standard of care for the surgical treatment of prostate cancer, we expect that the number of dvp procedures performed in the u.s. will fluctuate with the overall prostatectomy market. we believe the return to growth in dvp reflects surgical procedures being performed for men who may have previously deferred psa testing or definitive treatment. dvp adoption in our markets outside of the u.s. is at earlier stages, with lower market penetration, and has continued to grow since the usptf recommendation and despite shifting patient treatment trends that have negatively impacted the overall prostatectomy volumes in certain countries.
procedure seasonality. more than half of da vinci procedures performed are for benign conditions, most notably benign hysterectomies, hernia repairs, and cholecystectomies. the proportion of these benign procedures has grown over time in relation to the total number of procedures performed. hysterectomies for benign conditions, hernia repairs, cholecystectomies, and other short-term elective procedures tend to be more seasonal than cancer operations and surgeries for other life threatening conditions. seasonality for these benign procedures results in higher fourth quarter procedure volume when more patients have met annual deductibles and lower first quarter procedure volume when deductibles are reset. seasonality for 2015 was similar to years prior to 2014, with higher procedure volumes in the fourth quarter, and less pronounced than in early 2014, when we believe procedure volume was negatively impacted by transitional issues associated with the implementation of the affordable care act.
procedure mix. our procedure business is primarily comprised of: (1) cancer and other highly complex procedures and (2) less complex benign procedures. cancer and other highly complex procedures tend to be reimbursed at higher rates than less complex benign procedures. thus, hospitals are more sensitive to the costs associated with treating less complex benign conditions. our strategy is to provide hospitals with attractive clinical and economic solutions in each of these procedure categories. more fully featured products, including 4-arm, dual console, firefly enabled systems, and advanced instruments including vessel sealing and stapler are targeted towards more complex procedures. lower priced products, including three-arm da vinci si-e systems, refurbished da vinci si, and lower priced single-site instruments are targeted towards less complex procedures.
fda actions concerning morcellation. in april 2014, the fda announced that it discourages the use of power morcellators in the surgical removal of assumed benign fibroids. this statement was followed in july 2014 by an fda panel discussion on the topic. in november 2014, the fda issued specific contraindications for the use of laparoscopic power morcellation and required specific patient warning prior to its use in surgery. we do not manufacture or sell power morcellation products, and power morcellators do not attach to da vinci surgical systems. minimally invasive da vinci gynecologic surgeries are routinely performed without the use of power morcellators. however, we believe that these fda actions likely created some uncertainty for surgeons and patients when choosing among minimally invasive surgical methods for removing fibroids that may have adversely impacted the number of da vinci procedures performed. since the second quarter of 2014, we have experienced a decline in myomectomies that we believe likely reflected the impact of the fda actions. myomectomies are not a significant portion of our business. it is difficult to gauge what impact the fda actions may have had on benign dvh procedures, although as indicated above, an increasing proportion of our hysterectomy procedures in recent quarters have been performed by gynecologic oncologists.
system demand future demand for da vinci surgical systems will be impacted by factors including procedure growth rates, market response to our recently launched da vinci xi surgical system, hospitals consolidation trends, evolving system utilization and point of care dynamics, additional reimbursements in various global markets including japan, the timing around governmental tenders and authorizations, the timing of when we receive regulatory clearances in our other ous markets for our xi system and related instruments. future demand may also be impacted by anticipated robotic surgery competition, which is further described in the competition section included in part i, item 1.
recent media and lawsuits in recent years, various print, television, and internet media have released pieces questioning the patient safety and efficacy associated with da vinci surgery, the cost of da vinci surgery relative to other disease management methods, and the adequacy of surgeon training and our sales and marketing practices. in addition, as further described in note 7 to the consolidated financial
42
statements included in part ii, item 8, we are currently named as a defendant in approximately 92 individual product liability lawsuits and a multi-plaintiff product liability lawsuit filed on behalf of 55 patients who underwent da vinci surgery. plaintiffs' attorneys have been engaged in well-funded national advertising campaigns soliciting clients who have undergone da vinci surgery and claim to have suffered an injury, and we have seen a substantial increase in these claims. in an effort to avoid the expense and distraction of defending multiple lawsuits, we entered into tolling agreements to pause the applicable statutes of limitations for the claims, and engaged in mediation efforts. we believe that da vinci surgery continues to be a safe and effective surgical method, as supported by a substantial and growing number of scientific studies and peer reviewed papers. we also believe that we provide appropriate training on the use of the da vinci surgical system, consistent with our role as device manufacturer. however, the recent negative media publicity likely has and may continue to delay or adversely impact procedure adoption, system sales, and our revenue growth in future periods.
for the years ended december 31, 2015, and 2014, we recorded pre-tax charges of $13.8 million, and $82.4 million, respectively, to reflect the estimated cost of settling a number of the product liability claims covered by the tolling agreements. the claims relate to alleged complications from surgeries performed with certain versions of monopolar curved scissor (mcs) instruments that included an mcs tip cover accessory that was the subject of a market withdrawal in 2012 and mcs instruments that were the subject of a recall in 2013.
our estimate of the anticipated cost of settling these claims is based on negotiations with attorneys for claimants who have participated in a mediation process. nonetheless, it is possible that the claimants who participate in the mediations, as well as those claimants who have not participated in negotiations, will pursue greater amounts in mediation or in a court of law. consequently, the final outcome of these claims is dependent on many variables that are difficult to predict and the ultimate cost associated with these product liability claims may be materially different than the amount of the current estimate and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations or cash flows. although there is a reasonable possibility that a loss in excess of the amount recognized exists, we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amount recognized at this time. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 for further details.
new product introductions da vinci xi surgical system. during april 2014, we launched our newest da vinci model, the da vinci xi, in the u.s. the da vinci xi can be used across a wide spectrum of minimally invasive surgical procedures, and has been optimized for multi-quadrant surgeries. the da vinci xi expands upon core da vinci features including wristed instruments, 3-d hd visualization, intuitive motion, and ergonomic design, while improving ease, and delivering several new features, including:
•   a new overhead instrument arm architecture designed to facilitate anatomical access from virtually any position.
•   a new endoscope digital architecture that creates a simpler, more compact design with improved vision definition and clarity.
•   an ability to attach the endoscope to any arm, providing flexibility for visualizing the surgical site.
•   smaller, thinner arms with newly designed joints that offer a greater range of motion than ever before.
•   longer instrument shafts designed to give surgeons greater operative reach.
with the da vinci xi, we now offer hospitals a broader line of da vinci surgical systems to match their surgical profile and patient care requirements. these include the da vinci si-e, a lower price system suited for surgeries requiring two instrument arms; the da vinci si, which has the capability of controlling three instrument arms; and the da vinci xi, which has four universal instrument arms that attach to a rotating overhead platform. we separately applied for fda clearance for the da vinci xi firefly, vessel sealer, and stapler 45 products and received clearances for these products from june 2014 to august 2014. we received fda clearance for the integrated table motion for the da vinci xi surgical system in the u.s. in january 2016. we also filed for fda 510(k) clearances in the u.s. for the single-site instruments and the 30mm endowrist stapler products for the da vinci xi surgical system in august 2015.
we ce marked the da vinci xi system in june 2014 and have begun sales and marketing activities in certain countries recognizing the ce mark. in october 2014, we received regulatory clearance for the da vinci xi surgical system in south korea. in march 2015, we received regulatory clearance for the da vinci xi surgical system in japan. the regulatory status of the da vinci xi surgical system in other ous markets varies by country.
da vinci xi integrated table motion. the integrated table motion coordinates the movements of the da vinci robot arms with a version of a trumpf medicaltm trusystem® 7000dv operating room table to enable shifting a patient's position in real-time while the da vinci surgical robotic arms remains docked. this gives operating room teams the capabilities to optimally position the operating table so that gravity exposes anatomy during multi-quadrant da vinci system procedures, maximize reach and access to target anatomy enabling surgeons to interact with tissue at an ideal working angle, and reposition the table during the procedure to enhance anesthesiologists' care of the patient. in june 2015, we received ce mark clearance for our integrated table motion

product in europe. initial cases were successfully completed using the integrated table motion technology in the third quarter of 2015, and we began a phased introduction in europe during the fourth quarter of 2015. we received fda clearance for the da vinci xi integrated table motion product in january 2016.
endowrist stapler 45. in october 2012, we received fda clearance for the endowrist stapler 45 instrument with blue and green 45 mm reloads for use with the da vinci si surgical system. the endowrist stapler 45 is a wristed, stapling instrument intended for resection, transection and/or creation of anastomoses in general, gynecologic, and urologic surgery. this instrument enables operators to precisely position and fire the stapler. its initial surgical use was directed towards colorectal procedures. during 2013, the endowrist stapler was used by a limited and gradually increasing number of customers. in 2014, we expanded the availability of the endowrist stapler to a broadening set of customers. in september 2014, we notified our customers to suspend the use of the endowrist stapler 45 (see recalls and corrections section for additional discussion) and in january 2015, we began to ship the replacement product for the da vinci si. in january 2015, we also began to ship initial da vinci xi versions of the endowrist stapler 45, including blue, green, and white 45 mm reloads. the white reloads are only available on the da vinci xi platform. in april 2015, we received ce mark status to sell the endowrist stapler for the si and xi surgical systems in european markets.
although our early customer experiences have been positive and the proportion of colorectal procedures utilizing the endowrist stapler 45 has been increasing, we are in the early stages of selling endowrist stapler 45, and we are not able to predict the extent to which the instrument may be adopted.
endowrist stapler 30. in august 2015, we filed  for fda clearance in the u.s. for the endowrist stapler 30 instrument with blue, green, white, and gray 30 mm reloads for use with the da vinci xi surgical system. the endowrist stapler 30 is a wristed, stapling instrument intended for resection, transection and/or creation of anastomoses. subject to receiving fda clearance, we plan to execute a phased introduction of the endowrist stapler 30 product with expansion of the customer base as clinical experience is gained in the field. it is intended to deliver particular utility with fine tissue interaction in lobectomy and other thoracic procedures.

total revenue total revenue for the year ended december 31, 2015, was $2.4 billion and increased by 12% compared with $2.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014. total revenue for the year ended december 31, 2014, decreased by 6% compared with $2.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase in total revenue for the year ended december 31, 2015, reflects 14% higher systems revenue and 11% higher recurring revenue driven by approximately 14% higher procedure volume. the decline in total revenue for the year ended december 31, 2014, reflects 24% lower sales of da vinci systems, largely due to lower system sales in the u.s. and japan, partially offset by 5% higher recurring instruments, accessories, and services revenue, driven by an approximately 9% higher procedure volume.
we sell our products and services in euros and british pounds in those european markets where we have direct distribution channels, and in japanese yen and korean won. revenue for the year ended december 31, 2015, as compared with 2014, was negatively impacted by the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against these other currencies. we hedge a portion of our foreign currency denominated revenue and those hedges partially offset the negative impact of the strengthened u.s. dollar on revenue for the year ended december 31, 2015. revenue denominated in foreign currencies was approximately 19%, 16%, and 11% of total revenue for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
revenue generated in the u.s. accounted for 71%, 70%, and 72% of total revenue during the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. we believe that domestic revenue has accounted for the larger portion of total revenue due to patients' ability to choose their provider and method of treatment in the u.s., reimbursement structures supportive of innovation and minimally invasive surgery, and initial investments focused on domestic infrastructure. we have been investing in our business ous, and our ous procedures have grown faster in proportion to u.s. procedures. in future years, we expect our ous procedures and revenue will grow at a faster rate than in the u.s. and will make up an increasing portion of our business.

product revenue
2014-2015
product revenue increased by 13% to $1.9 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared with $1.7 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014.
instruments and accessories revenue increased by 12% to $1.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared with $1.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014. the increase in revenue was driven by approximately 14% higher procedure volume, reflecting approximately 11% u.s. procedure growth and 26% ous procedure growth as well as a higher product mix of advanced instruments, partially offset by an unfavorable impact of weakening foreign currencies.
46
systems revenue increased by 14% to $721.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared with $632.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, driven by higher da vinci surgical systems shipped in 2015. we shipped 492 da vinci surgical systems in 2015, compared with 431 in 2014, primarily reflecting higher system sales into the u.s. during 2015, 298 systems were shipped into the u.s., 90 into europe, 77 into asia, and 27 into other markets, compared with 238 systems shipped into the u.s., 97 into europe, 67 into asia, and 29 into other markets in 2014. the increase in u.s. systems sales was driven by higher procedure growth in 2015 and a favorable market response to the da vinci xi system that was launched in the second quarter of 2014.
the da vinci surgical system average selling price ("asp"), excluding the impact of units shipped under operating leases, was approximately $1.5 million for 2015 and 2014. the systems asp reflected a higher proportion of da vinci xi and dual console systems sold in 2015, partially offset by the negative impact of weaker foreign currencies.
2013-2014
product revenue decreased to $1.7 billion during the year ended december 31, 2014, from $1.9 billion during the year ended december 31, 2013.
instruments and accessories revenue increased to $1.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014, up 4% compared with $1.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase in instrument and accessory revenue was driven by an approximate 9% increase in procedure volume, partially offset by lower initial instrument and accessory stocking orders associated with lower 2014 system unit sales. the growth in our 2014 overall procedure volume was driven by growth in u.s. general surgery and worldwide urologic procedures.
systems revenue decreased to $632.5 million during the year ended december 31, 2014, down 24% from $834.9 million during the year ended december 31, 2013, primarily due to lower u.s. and japanese da vinci surgical system unit shipments, partially offset by higher da vinci surgical system unit shipments into europe and other ous markets. during 2014, 238 systems were sold into the u.s., 97 into europe, 67 into asia, and 29 into other markets, compared with 342 systems sold into the u.s., 82 into europe, 103 into asia, and 19 into other markets in 2013. the demand for systems is ultimately driven by da vinci surgical procedure volume and is highly sensitive to changes in procedure growth rates. the decline in u.s. system sales in 2014 was largely driven by moderating procedure growth (as described in the procedures section) resulting in lower need to expand capacity, as well as economic pressure and uncertainty at hospitals associated with the affordable care act, and evolving system utilization and point of care dynamics. the decrease in system sales in japan likely reflected the fact that only prostatectomies were broadly reimbursed and the effect of the pending approval of the da vinci xi system. the increase in system sales in europe reflected continued procedure growth and investments we have made in our european sales and marketing organizations.
the da vinci surgical system asp was fairly consistent at $1.5 million for 2014 and 2013.
service revenue service revenue increased by 8% to $464.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared with $429.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. service revenue increased by 8% to $429.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared with $397.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. we typically enter into multi-year fixed annual rate service contracts at the time systems are sold. these service contracts have been generally renewed at the end of the service periods. higher service revenue in 2015 and 2014 was primarily driven by a larger installed base of da vinci surgical systems producing service revenue.
gross profit product gross profit increased by 12% for the year ended december 31, 2015, to $1.3 billion, or 66.3% of product revenue, compared with $1.1 billion, or 66.5% of product revenue, for the year ended december 31, 2014. the lower 2015 product gross profit margin was driven by a higher sales mix of recently introduced products that yield lower gross profit margins, including the da vinci xi surgical system and endowrist one vessel sealer and stapler, and an unfavorable foreign currency impact related to ous sales.
margins on newly launched products have typically been lower than our mature products reflecting vendor pricing on lower volumes, temporary tooling and other start-up costs. over time, as volumes increase and we refine our manufacturing processes and products, we expect to see improvement in the margins of these newly launched products. however, gross margins may ultimately differ for these newly launched products relative to previously launched products based on market conditions, volume, and complexity of the product. product gross profit margin increased from 63.3% during the first quarter of 2015 to 67.9% of product revenue during the fourth quarter of 2015, reflecting higher product recalls and other one-time charges in the first quarter and manufacturing efficiency gains made during the year related to recently introduced products, including the da vinci xi, endowrist stapler, and endowrist one vessel sealer.
47
product gross profit for the year ended december 31, 2014, decreased by 14% to $1.1 billion, or 66.5% of product revenue, compared with $1.3 billion, or 70.9% of product revenue, for the year ended december 31, 2013. the lower 2014 product gross profit margin was driven by a higher sales mix of recently introduced products that yield lower gross profit margins, including the da vinci xi surgical system and endowrist one vessel sealer and stapler. other factors contributing to the lower 2014 product gross profit margin were a higher proportion of sales involving trade-ins and higher credits given for those trade-ins, higher 2014 incentive compensation, and higher product recall costs.
product gross profit for the year ended december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, included share-based compensation expense of $22.8 million, $19.1 million, and $17.6 million, respectively. product gross profit for the year ended december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 included amortization expense of purchased intellectual property of $12.7 million, $10.8 million, and $10.4 million, respectively.
product gross profit for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, included $17.0 million, $15.7 million, and $21.0 million, respectively, related to the u.s. medical device excise tax, which became effective january 1, 2013. in december 2015, president obama signed into law the consolidated appropriations act, 2016 (the "appropriations act"). the appropriations act includes a two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax such that medical device sales in 2016 and 2017 will be exempt from the excise tax. unless there is further legislative action during that two-year period, the medical device excise tax will be automatically reinstated for sales of medical devices on or after january 1, 2018.
service gross profit for the year ended december 31, 2015, increased to $305.5 million, or 65.7% of service revenue, compared with $281.0 million, or 65.5% of service revenue for the year ended december 31, 2014. the higher 2015 service gross profit was driven by higher service revenue, reflecting a larger installed base of da vinci surgical systems. consistent with product gross profit margin, service gross profit margin improved during 2015 from 63.3% of service revenue during the first quarter to 67.2% in the fourth quarter, reflecting efficiency gains made during the year to support the recently introduced da vinci xi platform in the field.
service gross profit for the year ended december 31, 2014, increased to $281.0 million, or 65.5% of service revenue, compared with $269.8 million, or 67.9% of service revenue for the year ended december 31, 2013. the higher 2014 service gross profit was driven by higher service revenue. the lower 2014 gross service profit margin was primarily driven by costs added to support the newly introduced da vinci xi system and higher incentive compensation.
service gross profit for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, included share-based compensation expense of $12.9 million, $13.5 million and $12.7 million, respectively.
selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses include costs for sales, marketing and administrative personnel, sales and marketing activities, tradeshow expenses, legal expenses, regulatory fees and general corporate expenses.
selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2015, decreased by 7% to $640.5 million, compared with $691.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. the decrease was primarily due to lower pre-tax litigation charges of $13.2 million in 2015, compared with $82.4 million in 2014, and to a lesser extent, the impact of the stronger u.s. dollar on expenses denominated in foreign currencies. these decreases were partially offset by increased costs associated with the expansion of our japanese and other organizations ous, as well as higher regulatory compliance costs and higher incentive compensation costs.
selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2014, increased by 20% to $691.0 million compared with $574.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase was primarily due to a pre-tax charge of $82.4 million recorded in 2014 to reflect the estimated cost of settling a number of the product liability claims covered by tolling agreements. in addition, selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2014, also increased due to higher legal costs related to the pending or threatened litigation, expansion of our japanese and other organizations ous, higher regulatory compliance costs, and higher incentive compensation.
share-based compensation expense charged to selling, general and administrative expenses during the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 were $94.7 million, $99.0 million, and $101.4 million, respectively.
research and development expenses research and development costs are expensed as incurred. research and development expenses include costs associated with the design, development, testing and significant enhancement of our products. these enhancements represent significant improvements to our products.
research and development expenses for the year ended december 31, 2015, increased by 11% to $197.4 million, compared with $178.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. the increase was driven primarily due to growth in our product development organization including earlier stage development in advanced imaging, advanced instrumentation, and next generation
48
robotics, and higher incentive compensation costs. research and development expenses fluctuate with project timing. we expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development and anticipate that research and development expenses will continue to increase in the future.
research and development expenses for the year ended december 31, 2014, increased by 6% to $178.0 million compared with $167.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase was primarily driven by higher headcount and incentive compensation expenses.
share-based compensation expense charged to research and development expense during the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, was $37.7 million, $37.5 million and $37.2 million, respectively. amortization expense related to purchased intellectual property for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, was $11.7 million, $11.6 million and $10.8 million, respectively.
interest and other income, net interest and other income, net, was $18.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2015, compared with $4.2 million for 2014 and $18.4 million for 2013. the increase in interest and other income, net for the year ended december 31, 2015, was partly due to higher 2015 interest income. interest and other income, net for the year ended december 31, 2014, as compared with 2015 and 2013, was lower primarily due to the $8.5 million impairment charges recorded in 2014 related to two equity investments.
income tax expense our income tax expense was $169.7 million, $130.2 million, and $199.9 million for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. the effective tax rate for 2015 was approximately 22.4% compared with 23.7% for 2014, and 23.0% for 2013. our tax rates for these periods differ from the u.s. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to the effect of income earned by certain of our overseas entities being taxed at rates lower than the federal statutory rate and reversal of certain unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by state income taxes net of federal benefit. the lower effective tax rate in 2015 resulted primarily from a $29.3 million tax benefit recorded in the third quarter of 2015 (of which $25.0 million was related to prior periods) due to a recent u.s. tax court opinion involving an independent third party, issued in the third quarter of 2015. based on the findings of the u.s. tax court, we were required to, and did, refund to our foreign subsidiaries the share-based compensation element of certain intercompany charges made in prior periods. starting from 2015, share-based compensation has been excluded from intercompany charges. we intend to indefinitely reinvest outside the u.s. all of our undistributed foreign earnings that were not previously subject to u.s. tax.
our 2015, 2014, and 2013 tax provision also reflected tax benefits of $6.4 million, $20.3 million, and $26.7 million, respectively, associated with the reversal of unrecognized tax benefits and interests resulting from expiration of statutes of limitations in multiple jurisdictions and certain audit settlements. as of december 31, 2015, and 2014, we had valuation allowances of $15.2 million and $9.5 million, respectively, primarily on california deferred tax assets, because it is more likely than not these deferred tax assets will not be realized as a result of the computation of california taxes under the single sales factor. we will continue to monitor and reassess the need for further increases or decreases to the valuation allowance.
we file federal, state, and foreign income tax returns in many jurisdictions in the u.s. and abroad. years prior to 2012 are considered closed for most significant jurisdictions. certain of our unrecognized tax benefits could reverse based on the normal expiration of various statutes of limitations, which could affect our effective tax rate in the period in which they reverse.
we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities and the outcome of these audits cannot be predicted with certainty. management regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. if any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.

liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash our principal source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and issuance of common stock through exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase program. cash and cash equivalents plus short and long-term investments increased by $0.8 billion to $3.3 billion at december 31, 2015, from $2.5 billion at december 31, 2014. cash and cash equivalents plus short and long-term investments decreased from $2.8 billion at december 31, 2013, to $2.5 billion at december 31, 2014, primarily due to the repurchase of $1.0 billion stock during 2014. cash generation is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting our operating, investing, and financing needs.
as of december 31, 2015, $987.2 million of our cash, cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries. amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to u.s. income tax on repatriation to the u.s. we currently have no plans to repatriate any foreign earnings back to the u.s. as we believe our cash flows provided by our u.s. operations will meet our u.s. liquidity needs for the foreseeable future.

operating activities for the year ended december 31, 2015, cash provided by our operating activities of $771.9 million exceeded our net income of $588.8 million for two primary reasons:
1.   our net income included non-cash charges primarily in the form of share-based compensation of $167.9 million, depreciation and loss of disposal of property, plant, and equipment of $65.1 million, income tax benefits from employee stock plans of $21.5 million, amortization of intangible assets of $24.4 million, and accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on investments of $26.4 million.
2.   the non-cash charges outlined above were partly offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities that resulted in $92.5 million of cash used by operating activities.
operating assets and liabilities are primarily comprised of accounts receivable, inventory, deferred revenue, other accrued liabilities, and prepaid expenses. accounts receivable increased $79.2 million in 2015 reflecting higher sales in 2015 and timing of sales and collections. prepaids and other assets increased $10.5 million primarily driven by higher lease receivable balances resulting from sales-type lease arrangements entered into in 2015. accrued liabilities decreased by $10.5 million mainly due to settlement payments made related to accrued product liability litigation. other changes in operating assets and liabilities include an inventory increase of $10.7 million, net of equipment transfers from inventories to property, plant and equipment, and a decrease in accounts payable of $11.3 million also resulted in cash used by operating activities. the unfavorable impact of these items on cash provided by operating activities was partly offset by a $21.5 million increase in accrued compensation and employee benefits and an $8.2 million increase of deferred revenue. deferred revenue, which includes deferred service revenue that is being recognized as revenue over the service contract period, increased primarily due to the increase in the number of installed systems for which service contracts existed.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, cash flow from operations of $665.1 million exceeded our net income of $418.8 million for two primary reasons:
1.   our net income included substantial non-cash charges primarily in the form of share-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, taxes, and depreciation. these non-cash charges totaled $232.1 million during the year ended december 31, 2014.
2.   changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in approximately $14.2 million in cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december 31, 2014
50
accrued liabilities increased $63.4 million, mainly driven by an increase in product liability accruals. deferred revenue increased by $19.8 million in 2014 primarily due to the increase in the number of installed systems for which service contracts existed. also, accrued compensation and accounts payable increased $39.1 million. the favorable impact of these items on cash provided by operating activities was partly offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $13.7 million in 2014 reflecting timing of our system sales and related collections, a net increase in inventory of $26.8 million primarily due to expanded product offerings, and an increase in prepaids and other assets of $67.6 million, primarily driven by timing of tax payments and an increase in lease receivables relating to sales-type lease arrangements entered into during 2014.
for the year ended december 31, 2013, cash flow from operations of $880.0 million exceeded our net income of $671.0 million for two primary reasons:
1.   our net income included substantial non-cash charges in the form of share-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, taxes, and depreciation. these non-cash charges totaled $231.0 million during the year ended december 31, 2013.
2.   changes in operating assets and liabilities resulting in cash used in operating activities during the year ended december 31, 2013 was approximately $22.0 million.
accounts receivable decreased by $68.9 million in 2013 reflecting lower system sales. inventory increased by $58.1 million in 2013 due to expanded product offerings and safety stocks acquired for key components. deferred revenue increased $15.3 million in 2013 primarily due to the increase in the number of installed systems for which service contracts exist. other liabilities including accounts payable, accrued compensation and employee benefits, and accrued liabilities decreased by $35.1 million in 2013 primarily due to timing of vendor, tax and employee compensation payments during 2013.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2015, consisted of purchases of investments (net of the proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments) of $768.5 million and purchases of property and equipment $81.0 million.
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2014, consisted primarily of cash used for purchases of property and equipment of $105.6 million and purchases of businesses of $84.3 million, partially offset by the proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments (net of purchases of investments) of $36.0 million. purchases of property included the acquisition of approximately 15 acres of land in sunnyvale, california for future expansion in 2014. for the year ended december 31, 2014, we acquired certain intellectual property, know-how, fixed assets, and employees from luna innovations, inc. and we reacquired the distribution rights from our former japanese distributor, adachi co, ltd.
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december 31, 2013, consisted primarily of proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments (net of purchases of investments) of $363.6 million, less purchases of property and equipment and licensing of intellectual property of $104.6 million.
we invest predominantly in high quality, fixed income securities. our investment portfolio may at any time contain investments in u.s. treasury and u.s. government agency securities, taxable and/or tax exempt municipal notes, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, cash deposits, and money market funds.
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities in 2015 consisted primarily of proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases of $361.1 million and excess tax benefits of $34.3 million, partly offset by $183.7 million used for the repurchase of 0.4 million shares of our common stock through open market transactions and taxes paid on behalf of employees related to net share settlement of vested employee equity awards of $11.0 million.
net cash used in financing activities in 2014 consisted primarily of $1.0 billion used for the repurchase of 2.5 million shares of our common stock through an accelerated share repurchase program, offset by proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases of $283.6 million and excess tax benefits of $24.0 million.
net cash used in financing activities in 2013 consisted primarily of $1.1 billion used for the repurchase of 2.6 million shares of our common stock, offset by proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases of $160.6 million and excess tax benefits of $38.0 million.
our cash requirements depend on numerous factors, including market acceptance of our products, the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products and other factors. we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to expand procedure adoption and acceptance of our products. we have made substantial investments in our commercial operations, product development activities, facilities, and intellectual property. based upon our business model, we anticipate that we will continue to be able to fund future growth through cash provided from operations. we believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, together with income to be derived from the sale of our products, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements beyond one year and for the foreseeable future.

contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31, 2015 (in millions):
payments due by period total             less than1 year             1 to 3 years             3 to 5 years       more than 5 years operating leases                           $31.2                    $6.1                      $6.6                     $3.7              $14.8

total contractual obligations             $263.4                  $231.9                     $13.0                     $3.7              $14.8
operating leases. we lease spaces for operations in the u.s. as well as in japan, south korea, mexico, and other foreign countries. we also lease automobiles for certain sales and field service employees. operating lease amounts include future minimum lease payments under all our non-cancellable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year.
purchase commitments and obligations. these amounts include an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, including commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services and acquisition and licensing of intellectual property. a majority of these purchase obligations are due within a year. although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services. in addition to the above, we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing, collaboration and development arrangements. payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and have not been included in the table above.
other commitments. we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when payments may occur for our unrecognized tax benefits. therefore, our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is not included in the table above.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2015, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of sec regulation s-k promulgated under the exchange act.
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("u.s. gaap"), which requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions. see "note 2. summary of significant accounting policies," in notes to the consolidated financial statements, which is included in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data," which describes our significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. the methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. our most critical accounting estimates include:
•   the valuation and recognition of investments, which impacts our investment portfolio balance when we assess fair value, and interest and other income, net, when we record impairments;
•   the valuation of revenue and allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts, which impacts revenue;
•   the estimation of transactions to hedge, which impacts revenue and other expense;
•   the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross profit margins;
•   the assessment of recoverability of intangible assets and their estimated useful lives, which primarily impacts gross profit margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their amortization;
•   the valuation and recognition of share-based compensation, which impacts gross profit margin and operating expenses;
•   the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impact our provision for taxes; and
•   the estimate of probable loss associated with product liability claims, which impacts accrued liabilities and operating expenses.

investments valuation fair value our investment portfolio may at any time contain investments in u.s. treasury and u.s. government agency securities, non-u.s. government securities, taxable and/or tax exempt municipal notes, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, cash deposits, and money market funds. in the current market environment, the assessment of the fair value of investments can be difficult and subjective. u.s. gaap establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value. valuation of level 1 and 2 instruments generally do not require significant management judgment and the estimation is not difficult. level 3 instruments include unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. the determination of fair value for level 3 instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity. during the year ended december 31, 2014, the level 3 securities were redeemed. there were no other level 3 securities as of the years ended december 31, 2015, and 2014.
other-than-temporary impairment after determining the fair value of our available-for-sales instruments, gains or losses on these securities are recorded to other comprehensive income, until either the security is sold or we determine that the decline in value is other-than-temporary. the primary differentiating factors we considered in classifying impairments as either temporary or other-than-temporary impairments are our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value, the length of the time and the extent to which the market value of the investment has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer. given the current market conditions, these judgments could prove to be wrong, and companies with relatively high credit ratings and solid financial conditions may not be able to fulfill their obligations.
no impairment charges were recorded during the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2013. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we recorded pre-tax losses of $8.5 million related to a decline in the value of two equity investments that we concluded were other-than-temporary. as of december 31, 2015, and 2014, net unrealized losses on investments of $4.2 million and $0.2 million, net of tax, respectively, were included in accumulated other comprehensive loss.
allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts. we record estimated reductions in revenue for potential returns of products by customers and other allowances. as a result, management must make estimates of potential future product returns and other allowances related to current period product revenue. in making such estimates, management analyzes historical returns, current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products. if management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates, material differences in the amount of reported revenue could result.
similarly, we make estimates of the collectability of accounts receivable, especially analyzing the aging and nature of accounts receivable and historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends, and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. credit evaluations are undertaken for all major sale transactions before shipment is authorized. on a quarterly basis, we evaluate aged items in the accounts receivable aging report and provide an allowance in an amount we deem adequate for doubtful accounts. if management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates, material differences in the amount of our reported operating expenses could result.
hedge accounting for derivatives. we utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency sales transactions. when specific criteria required by relevant accounting standards have been met, changes in fair values of hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income ("oci") rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income. by their nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. when we determine that the transactions are no longer probable within a certain time-frame, we are required to reclassify the cumulative changes in the fair values of the related hedge contracts from oci to net income.
inventory valuation. inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates actual costs, or market, on a first-in, first-out basis. the cost basis of our inventory is reduced for any products that are considered excessive or obsolete based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations.
intangible assets. our intangible assets include identifiable intangibles and goodwill. identifiable intangibles include developed technology, patents, distribution rights, customer relationships, and licenses. all of our identifiable intangibles have finite lives. goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to an annual impairment review (or more frequent if impairment indicators arise) by applying a fair-value based test. there have been no impairments from the analysis required by u.s. gaap.
53
identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are subject to impairment testing and are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value. we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of these identifiable intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated from such assets. if the cash flow estimates or the significant operating assumptions upon which they are based change in the future, we may be required to record additional impairment charges.
the valuation and classification of intangible assets and goodwill and the assignment of useful lives for purposes of amortization involves judgments and the use of estimates. the evaluation of these intangibles and goodwill for impairment under established accounting guidelines is required on a recurring basis. changes in business conditions could potentially require future adjustments to the assumptions made. when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of amortization over the assets' new, shorter useful lives. no impairment charge or accelerated amortization was recorded for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013. a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing impairment, which includes financial forecasts. if conditions are different from management's current estimates, material write-downs of long-lived assets may be required, which would adversely affect our operating results.
revenue recognition. our system sale arrangements contain multiple elements, including system(s), system accessories, instruments, accessories, and system service. we generally deliver all of the elements, other than service, within days of entering into the system sale arrangement. each of these elements is a separate unit of accounting. system accessories, instruments, accessories, and service are also sold on a stand-alone basis.
for multiple-element arrangements, revenue is allocated to each unit of accounting based on their relative selling prices. relative selling prices are based first on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value ("vsoe"), then on third-party evidence of selling price ("tpe") when vsoe does not exist, and then on management's best estimate of the selling price ("esp") when vsoe and tpe do not exist.
our system sale arrangements generally include a one-year period of free service, and the right for the customer to purchase service annually after that for up to four years at a stated service price. the revenue allocated to the free service period is deferred and recognized ratably over the free service period.
because we have neither vsoe nor tpe for our systems, the allocation of revenue is based on esp for the systems sold. the objective of esp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale, had the product been sold on a stand-alone basis. we determine esp for our systems by considering multiple factors, including, but not limited to, features and functionality of the system, geographies, type of customer, and market conditions. we regularly review esp and maintain internal controls over establishing and updating these estimates.
accounting for stock options. we account for share-based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of u.s. gaap. we use the black-scholes-merton option-pricing model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions. these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them, the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term, and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements. the assumptions for expected volatility and expected term are the two assumptions that most significantly affect the grant date fair value of stock options. changes in expected risk-free rate of return do not significantly impact the calculation of fair value, and determining this input is not highly subjective.
we use implied volatility based on freely traded options in the open market, as we believe implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility. in determining the appropriateness of relying on implied volatility, we considered the following:
•   the sufficiency of the trading volume of freely traded options;
•   the ability to reasonably match the terms, such as the date of the grant and the exercise price of the freely traded options to options granted; and
•   the length of the term of the freely traded options used to derive implied volatility.
the expected term represents the weighted-average period that our stock options are expected to be outstanding. the expected term is based on the observed and expected time to exercise. we determine expected term based on historical exercise patterns and our expectation of the time it will take for employees to exercise options still outstanding.
u.s. gaap requires us to develop an estimate of the number of share-based awards that will be forfeited due to employee turnover. adjustments in the estimated forfeiture rates can have a significant effect on our reported share-based compensation, as we recognize the cumulative effect of the rate adjustments for all expense amortization in the period the estimated forfeiture rates were adjusted. we estimate and adjust forfeiture rates based on a periodic review of recent forfeiture activity and expected future employee turnover. if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than previously estimated forfeiture rate, we may make an adjustment that will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements during the period when the rate was changed. adjustments in the estimated forfeiture rates could also cause changes in the amount of expense that we recognize in future periods.
54
changes in these subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock options and, consequently, the related amount of share-based compensation expense recognized on the consolidated statements of income.
accounting for income taxes. significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets in accordance with u.s. gaap. these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in the current or subsequent period.
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. if recovery is less than a 50% likelihood, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be recoverable. as of december 31, 2015, we believe it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets ultimately will be recovered with the exception of our california deferred tax assets. we believe that due to the computation of california taxes under the single sales factor, it is more likely than not that our california deferred tax assets will not be realized. should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would be affected in the period in which such change takes place.
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. if we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit, then the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. we re-evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. this evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effective settlement of audit issues, and new audit activity. such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.
accounting for legal contingencies. we are involved in a number of legal proceedings involving product liability, intellectual property, shareholder derivative actions, securities class actions, insurance, employee related, and other matters. we record a liability and related charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements for legal contingencies when the loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. our assessment is reevaluated each accounting period and is based on all available information, including discussion with any outside legal counsel that represents us. if a reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss cannot be made, but a range of probable losses can be estimated, the low-end of the range of losses is recognized if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other. if a loss is reasonably possible, but not probable and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
when determining the estimated probable loss or range of losses, significant judgment is required to be exercised in order to estimate the amount and timing of the loss to be recorded. estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation are inherently difficult to make, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages with incomplete facts and information. the final outcome of legal proceedings is dependent on many variables difficult to predict, and therefore, the ultimate cost to entirely resolve such matters may be materially different than the amount of current estimates. consequently, new information or changes in judgments and estimates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations or cash flows.

the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis executive overview
2016 versus 2015. we generated net earnings of $7.40 billion and diluted earnings per common share of $16.29 for 2016, an increase of 22% and 34%, respectively, compared with $6.08 billion and $12.14 per share for 2015. return on average common shareholders' equity (roe) was 9.4% for 2016, compared with 7.4% for 2015. book value per common share was $182.47 as of december 2016, 6.7% higher compared with the end of 2015.
net revenues were $30.61 billion for 2016, 9% lower than 2015, due to significantly lower net revenues in investing & lending and lower net revenues in investment banking, institutional client services and investment management. these results reflected the impact of a challenging operating environment during the first half of the year, particularly during the first quarter, although the environment improved during the second half of the year.
operating expenses were $20.30 billion for 2016, 19% lower than 2015, primarily due to significantly lower non-compensation expenses, primarily reflecting significantly lower net provisions for mortgage-related litigation and regulatory matters, as the prior year included provisions for the settlement agreement with the residential mortgage-backed securities working group of the u.s. financial fraud enforcement task force (rmbs working group), as well as lower market development expenses and professional fees, reflecting expense savings initiatives. compensation and benefits expenses were also lower, reflecting a decrease in net revenues and the impact of expense savings initiatives.
we continued to maintain strong capital ratios and liquidity, while returning $7.20 billion of capital to shareholders during 2016. during the year, we repurchased 36.6 million shares of our common stock for a total cost of $6.07 billion and paid common stock dividends of $1.13 billion. our common equity tier 1 ratio as calculated in accordance with the standardized approach and the basel iii advanced approach, in each case reflecting the applicable transitional provisions, was 14.5% and 13.1%, respectively, and our global core liquid assets were $226 billion, all as of december 2016. see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our capital ratios. see "risk management Â— liquidity risk management" below for further information about our global core liquid assets.
in the context of the challenging environment during the first half of 2016, we completed an initiative that identified areas where we can operate more efficiently, resulting in a reduction of approximately $900 million in annual run rate compensation. for 2016, net savings from this initiative, after severance and other related costs, were approximately $500 million.
2015 versus 2014. we generated net earnings of $6.08 billion and diluted earnings per common share of $12.14 for 2015, a decrease of 28% and 29%, respectively, compared with $8.48 billion and $17.07 per share for 2014. roe was 7.4% for 2015, compared with 11.2% for 2014. during 2015, we recorded provisions for the settlement agreement with the rmbs working group of $3.37 billion ($2.99 billion after-tax), which reduced diluted earnings per common share by $6.53 and roe by 3.8 percentage points. see note 27 to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of the 2015 form 10-k for further information.
book value per common share was $171.03 as of december 2015, 4.9% higher compared with the end of 2014. during 2015, we repurchased 22.1 million shares of our common stock for a total cost of $4.20 billion.
net revenues were $33.82 billion for 2015, 2% lower than 2014, as significantly lower net revenues in investing & lending were largely offset by higher net revenues in investment banking and slightly higher net revenues in investment management. net revenues in institutional client services were essentially unchanged compared with 2014.
operating expenses were $25.04 billion for 2015, 13% higher than 2014, due to significantly higher non-compensation expenses, primarily reflecting significantly higher net provisions for mortgage-related litigation and regulatory matters. compensation and benefits expenses were essentially unchanged compared with the prior year.
as of december 2015, our common equity tier 1 ratio as calculated in accordance with the standardized approach and the basel iii advanced approach, in each case reflecting the applicable transitional provisions, was 13.6% and 12.4%, respectively. in addition, our global core liquid assets were $199 billion as of december 2015.
48   goldman sachs 2016 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis business environment global during 2016, real gross domestic product (gdp) growth appeared to slow in advanced economies and appeared mixed in emerging market economies compared with 2015. in advanced economies, growth was lower in the u.s., the euro area, the u.k. and japan. in emerging markets, growth slowed in china and appeared to slow in india, while real gdp appeared to contract less in brazil and russia than in 2015. monetary policy divergence continued in 2016, as the u.s. federal reserve increased its target interest rate again, while monetary policy remained accommodative in europe and japan. in june, a referendum was passed for the u.k. to exit the e.u., and in november, the u.s. held its presidential election. the market reaction to the outcomes of both events was generally more positive than expectations. the price of crude oil (wti) increased by 45% in 2016 and, in the fourth quarter, opec members announced an agreement to reduce oil production. in investment banking, industry-wide mergers and acquisitions activity remained strong for 2016, but declined compared with the level of activity in 2015. industry-wide volumes in equity underwriting declined compared with a strong 2015, while industry-wide debt underwriting volumes increased compared with the prior year.

critical accounting policies fair value fair value hierarchy. financial instruments owned, at fair value and financial instruments sold, but not yet purchased, at fair value (i.e., inventory), as well as certain other financial assets and financial liabilities, are reflected in our consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value (i.e., marked-to-market), with related gains or losses generally recognized in our consolidated statements of earnings. the use of fair value to measure financial instruments is fundamental to our risk management practices and is our most critical accounting policy.
the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. we measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities as a portfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to market and/or credit risks). in determining fair value, the hierarchy under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap) gives (i) the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities (level 1 inputs), (ii) the next priority to inputs other than level 1 inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly (level 2 inputs), and (iii) the lowest priority to inputs that cannot be observed in market activity (level 3 inputs). in evaluating the significance of a valuation input, we consider, among other factors, a portfolio's net risk exposure to that input. assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to their fair value measurement.
the fair values for substantially all of our financial assets and financial liabilities are based on observable prices and inputs and are classified in levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. certain level 2 and level 3 financial assets and financial liabilities may require appropriate valuation adjustments that a market participant would require to arrive at fair value for factors such as counterparty and our credit quality, funding risk, transfer restrictions, liquidity and bid/offer spreads.
50   goldman sachs 2016 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis instruments categorized within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are those which require one or more significant inputs that are not observable. as of december 2016 and december 2015, level 3 financial assets represented 2.7% and 2.8%, respectively, of our total assets. see notes 5 through 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about level 3 financial assets, including changes in level 3 financial assets and related fair value measurements. absent evidence to the contrary, instruments classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are initially valued at transaction price, which is considered to be the best initial estimate of fair value. subsequent to the transaction date, we use other methodologies to determine fair value, which vary based on the type of instrument. estimating the fair value of level 3 financial instruments requires judgments to be made. these judgments include:
Â•   determining the appropriate valuation methodology and/or model for each type of level 3 financial instrument;
Â•   determining model inputs based on an evaluation of all relevant empirical market data, including prices evidenced by market transactions, interest rates, credit spreads, volatilities and correlations; and
Â•   determining appropriate valuation adjustments, including those related to illiquidity or counterparty credit quality.
regardless of the methodology, valuation inputs and assumptions are only changed when corroborated by substantive evidence.
controls over valuation of financial instruments. market makers and investment professionals in our revenue-producing units are responsible for pricing our financial instruments. our control infrastructure is independent of the revenue-producing units and is fundamental to ensuring that all of our financial instruments are appropriately valued at market-clearing levels. in the event that there is a difference of opinion in situations where estimating the fair value of financial instruments requires judgment (e.g., calibration to market comparables or trade comparison, as described below), the final valuation decision is made by senior managers in control and support functions. this independent price verification is critical to ensuring that our financial instruments are properly valued.
price verification. all financial instruments at fair value in levels 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy are subject to our independent price verification process. the objective of price verification is to have an informed and independent opinion with regard to the valuation of financial instruments under review. instruments that have one or more significant inputs which cannot be corroborated by external market data are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. price verification strategies utilized by our independent control and support functions include:
Â•                     trade comparison. analysis of trade data (both internal and external where available) is used to determine the most relevant pricing inputs and valuations.
Â•                                                                                              external price comparison. valuations and prices are compared to pricing data obtained from third parties (e.g., brokers or dealers, markit, bloomberg, idc, trace). data obtained from various sources is compared to ensure consistency and validity. when broker or dealer quotations or third-party pricing vendors are used for valuation or price verification, greater priority is generally given to executable quotations.
Â•                    calibration to market comparables. market-based transactions are used to corroborate the valuation of positions with similar characteristics, risks and components.
Â•                                                             relative value analyses. market-based transactions are analyzed to determine the similarity, measured in terms of risk, liquidity and return, of one instrument relative to another or, for a given instrument, of one maturity relative to another.
Â•      collateral analyses. margin calls on derivatives are analyzed to determine implied values which are used to corroborate our valuations.
Â•                execution of trades. where appropriate, trading desks are instructed to execute trades in order to provide evidence of market-clearing levels.
Â•   backtesting. valuations are corroborated by comparison to values realized upon sales.
see notes 5 through 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about fair value measurements.
review of net revenues. independent control and support functions ensure adherence to our pricing policy through a combination of daily procedures, including the explanation and attribution of net revenues based on the underlying factors. through this process we independently validate net revenues, identify and resolve potential fair value or trade booking issues on a timely basis and seek to ensure that risks are being properly categorized and quantified.
the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis review of valuation models. our independent model risk management group (model risk management), consisting of quantitative professionals who are separate from model developers, performs an independent model review and validation process of our valuation models. new or changed models are reviewed and approved prior to being put into use. models are evaluated and re-approved annually to assess the impact of any changes in the product or market and any market developments in pricing theories. see "risk management Â— model risk management" for further information about the review and validation of our valuation models.
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets goodwill. goodwill is the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of net assets, including identifiable intangible assets, at the acquisition date. goodwill is assessed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that indicate an impairment may exist, by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if the results of the qualitative assessment are not conclusive, a quantitative goodwill test is performed by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its estimated net book value.
during the fourth quarter of 2016, we assessed goodwill for impairment using a qualitative assessment. the qualitative assessment required management to make judgments and to evaluate several factors, which included, but were not limited to, performance indicators, firm and industry events, macroeconomic indicators and fair value indicators. based on our evaluation of these factors, we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its respective carrying amount.
notwithstanding the results of the qualitative assessment, since the 2015 quantitative goodwill test determined that the estimated fair value of the fixed income, currency and commodities client execution reporting unit was not substantially in excess of its carrying value, we also performed a quantitative test on this reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2016. in the quantitative test, the estimated fair value of the fixed income, currency and commodities client execution reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value.
therefore, we determined that goodwill for all reporting units was not impaired.
estimating the fair value of our reporting units requires management to make judgments. critical inputs to the fair value estimates include projected earnings and attributed equity. there is inherent uncertainty in the projected earnings. the net book value of each reporting unit reflects an allocation of total shareholders' equity and represents the estimated amount of total shareholders' equity required to support the activities of the reporting unit under currently applicable regulatory capital requirements. see "equity capital management and regulatory capital" for further information about our capital requirements.
if we experience a prolonged or severe period of weakness in the business environment or financial markets, or additional increases in capital requirements, our goodwill could be impaired in the future. in addition, significant changes to other inputs of the quantitative goodwill test could cause the estimated fair value of our reporting units to decline, which could result in an impairment of goodwill in the future.
see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our goodwill.
identifiable intangible assets. we amortize our identifiable intangible assets over their estimated useful lives generally using the straight-line method. identifiable intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset's or asset group's carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
a prolonged or severe period of market weakness, or significant changes in regulation, could adversely impact our businesses and impair the value of our identifiable intangible assets. in addition, certain events could indicate a potential impairment of our identifiable intangible assets, including weaker business performance resulting in a decrease in our customer base and decreases in revenues from customer contracts and relationships. management judgment is required to evaluate whether indications of potential impairment have occurred, and to test intangible assets for impairment if required.
an impairment, generally calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of an asset or asset group, is recognized if the total of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying value.
see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our identifiable intangible assets.

use of estimates the use of generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. in addition to the estimates we make in connection with fair value measurements and the accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, the use of estimates and assumptions is also important in determining provisions for losses that may arise from litigation, regulatory proceedings (including governmental investigations) and tax audits, and the allowance for losses on loans and lending commitments held for investment.
we estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. in addition, we estimate the upper end of the range of reasonably possible aggregate loss in excess of the related reserves for litigation and regulatory proceedings where we believe the risk of loss is more than slight. see notes 18 and 27 to the consolidated financial statements for information about certain judicial, litigation and regulatory proceedings.
significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different. our total estimated liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case-by-case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case, proceeding or investigation, our experience and the experience of others in similar cases, proceedings or investigations, and the opinions and views of legal counsel.
in accounting for income taxes, we recognize tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the relevant taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position. see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about accounting for income taxes.
we also estimate and record an allowance for credit losses related to our loans receivable and lending commitments held for investment. management's estimate of loan losses entails judgment about loan collectability at the reporting dates, and there are uncertainties inherent in those judgments. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the allowance for losses on loans and lending commitments held for investment.
results of operations the composition of our net revenues has varied over time as financial markets and the scope of our operations have changed. the composition of net revenues can also vary over the shorter term due to fluctuations in u.s. and global economic and market conditions. see "risk factors" in part i, item 1a of this form 10-k for further information about the impact of economic and market conditions on our results of operations.

operating environment. during the first quarter of 2016, our business activities were negatively impacted by challenging trends in the operating environment, including concerns and uncertainties about global economic growth and central bank activity as well as higher levels of volatility, all of which contributed to significant price pressure at the beginning of the year across both equity and fixed income markets. these factors negatively impacted investor conviction and risk appetite for market-making activities, and industry-wide equity underwriting and mergers and acquisitions activity for investment banking activities. results in other principal transactions also reflected the impact of these difficult market and economic conditions. at the start of the second quarter of 2016, concerns about global economic growth moderated and conditions improved in many businesses, including a rebound in investment banking activities and improved results in other principal transactions. however, later in the second quarter, the market became increasingly focused on the political uncertainty and economic implications surrounding the potential exit of the u.k. from the e.u., impacting market-making activities.
the operating environment improved during the second half of 2016, as global equity markets steadily increased and credit spreads tightened, providing a more favorable backdrop for our business activities. for investment management activities, our assets under supervision continued to increase during 2016. the mix of our average assets under supervision shifted slightly compared with 2015 from long-term assets under supervision to liquidity products.
if the trend of macroeconomic concerns continues over the long term, and market-making activity levels, investment banking activity levels, or assets under supervision decline or if investors continue the trend of favoring assets under supervision that typically generate lower fees, net revenues would likely be negatively impacted. see "segment operating results" below for further information about the operating environment and material trends and uncertainties that may impact our results of operations.
during 2015, the operating environment for market-making activities was positively impacted by diverging central bank monetary policies in the u.s. and the euro area in the first quarter, as increased volatility levels contributed to strong client activity levels in currencies, interest rate products and equity products. however, during the remainder of 2015, concerns about global growth and uncertainty about the u.s. federal reserve's interest rate policy, along with lower global equity prices, widening high-yield credit spreads and declining commodity prices, contributed to lower levels of client activity, particularly in mortgages and credit, and more difficult market-making conditions.
54   goldman sachs 2016 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis the operating environment for investment banking activities for 2015 reflected strong industry-wide mergers and acquisitions activity. in addition, investment management reflected an environment generally characterized by strong client net inflows, which more than offset the declines in equity and fixed income asset prices. although other principal transactions for 2015 benefited from favorable company-specific events, including sales, initial public offerings and financings, a decline in global equity prices and widening high-yield credit spreads during the second half of 2015 impacted results.
2016 versus 2015
net revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $30.61 billion for 2016, 9% lower than 2015, reflecting the impact of a challenging operating environment during the first half of the year, particularly during the first quarter, although the environment improved during the second half of the year. the decrease in net revenues was primarily due to significantly lower other principal transactions revenues and lower investment banking revenues, net interest income and investment management revenues. in addition, commissions and fees were slightly lower. these results were partially offset by slightly higher market-making revenues.
non-interest revenues. investment banking revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $6.27 billion for 2016, 11% lower compared with a strong 2015. revenues in financial advisory were lower compared with a strong 2015, reflecting a decrease in industry-wide transactions. revenues in underwriting were lower compared with a strong 2015, due to significantly lower revenues in equity underwriting, reflecting a decrease in industry-wide volumes. revenues in debt underwriting were significantly higher, reflecting significantly higher revenues from asset-backed activity and higher revenues from leveraged finance activity.
investment management revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $5.41 billion for 2016, 8% lower than 2015, primarily reflecting significantly lower incentive fees compared with a strong 2015. in addition, management and other fees were slightly lower, reflecting shifts in the mix of client assets and strategies, partially offset by the impact of higher average assets under supervision.
commissions and fees in the consolidated statements of earnings were $3.21 billion for 2016, 3% lower than 2015, reflecting lower listed cash equity volumes in asia and europe, consistent with market volumes in these regions.
market-making revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $9.93 billion for 2016, 4% higher than 2015, due to significantly higher revenues in interest rate products and credit products. these results were partially offset by significantly lower revenues in equity cash products and lower revenues in currencies, mortgages, equity derivative products and commodities.
other principal transactions revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $3.20 billion for 2016, 36% lower than 2015, primarily due to significantly lower revenues from investments in equities, primarily reflecting a significant decrease in net gains from private equities, driven by company-specific events and corporate performance. in addition, revenues in debt securities and loans were significantly lower compared with 2015, reflecting significantly lower revenues related to relationship lending activities, due to the impact of changes in credit spreads on economic hedges. losses related to these hedges were $596 million in 2016, compared with gains of $329 million in 2015. this decrease was partially offset by higher net gains from investments in debt instruments. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about economic hedges related to our relationship lending activities.
net interest income. net interest income in the consolidated statements of earnings was $2.59 billion for 2016, 16% lower than 2015, reflecting an increase in interest expense primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on other interest-bearing liabilities, interest-bearing deposits and collateralized financings, and increases in total average long-term borrowings and total average interest-bearing deposits. the increase in interest expense was partially offset by higher interest income related to collateralized agreements, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates, and loans receivable, reflecting an increase in total average balances and the impact of higher interest rates. see "statistical disclosures Â— distribution of assets, liabilities and shareholders' equity" for further information about our sources of net interest income.
2015 versus 2014
net revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $33.82 billion for 2015, 2% lower than 2014, reflecting significantly lower other principal transactions revenues and net interest income, largely offset by higher market-making revenues and investment banking revenues, as well as slightly higher investment management revenues. commissions and fees were essentially unchanged compared with 2014.
the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis non-interest revenues. investment banking revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $7.03 billion for 2015, 9% higher than 2014, due to significantly higher revenues in financial advisory, reflecting strong client activity, particularly in the u.s. industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions increased significantly compared with the prior year. revenues in underwriting were lower compared with a strong 2014. revenues in debt underwriting were lower compared with 2014, reflecting significantly lower leveraged finance activity. revenues in equity underwriting were also lower, reflecting significantly lower revenues from initial public offerings and convertible offerings, partially offset by significantly higher revenues from secondary offerings.
investment management revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $5.87 billion for 2015, 2% higher than 2014, due to slightly higher management and other fees, primarily reflecting higher average assets under supervision, and higher transaction revenues.
commissions and fees in the consolidated statements of earnings were $3.32 billion for 2015, essentially unchanged compared with 2014.
market-making revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $9.52 billion for 2015, 14% higher than 2014. excluding a gain of $289 million in 2014 related to the extinguishment of certain of our junior subordinated debt, market-making revenues were 18% higher than 2014, reflecting significantly higher revenues in interest rate products, currencies, equity cash products and equity derivatives. these increases were partially offset by significantly lower revenues in mortgages, commodities and credit products.
other principal transactions revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $5.02 billion for 2015, 24% lower than 2014. this decrease was primarily due to lower revenues from investments in equities, principally reflecting the sale of metro international trade services (metro) in the fourth quarter of 2014 and lower net gains from investments in private equities, driven by corporate performance. in addition, revenues in debt securities and loans were significantly lower, reflecting lower net gains from investments.
net interest income. net interest income in the consolidated statements of earnings was $3.06 billion for 2015, 24% lower than 2014. the decrease compared with 2014 was due to lower interest income resulting from a reduction in interest income related to financial instruments owned, at fair value, partially offset by the impact of an increase in total average loans receivable. the decrease in interest income was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense, which primarily reflected lower interest expense related to financial instruments sold, but not yet purchased, at fair value and other interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by higher interest expense related to long-term borrowings. see "supplemental financial information Â— statistical disclosures Â— distribution of assets, liabilities and shareholders' equity" for further information about our sources of net interest income.
operating expenses our operating expenses are primarily influenced by compensation, headcount and levels of business activity. compensation and benefits includes salaries, discretionary compensation, amortization of equity awards and other items such as benefits. discretionary compensation is significantly impacted by, among other factors, the level of net revenues, overall financial performance, prevailing labor markets, business mix, the structure of our share-based compensation programs and the external environment. in addition, see "use of estimates" for additional information about expenses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings.
in the context of the challenging environment during the first half of 2016, we completed an initiative that identified areas where we can operate more efficiently, resulting in a reduction of approximately $900 million in annual run rate compensation. for 2016, net savings from this initiative, after severance and other related costs, were approximately $500 million.

2016 versus 2015. operating expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings were $20.30 billion for 2016, 19% lower than 2015. compensation and benefits expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings were $11.65 billion for 2016, 8% lower than 2015, reflecting a decrease in net revenues and the impact of expense savings initiatives. the ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues for 2016 was 38.1% compared with 37.5% for 2015. total staff decreased 7% during 2016, due to expense savings initiatives.
non-compensation expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings were $8.66 billion for 2016, 30% lower than 2015, primarily due to significantly lower net provisions for mortgage-related litigation and regulatory matters, which are included in other expenses. in addition, market development expenses and professional fees were lower compared with 2015, reflecting expense savings initiatives. net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings for 2016 were $396 million compared with $4.01 billion for 2015 (2015 primarily related to net provisions for mortgage-related matters). 2016 included a $114 million charitable contribution to goldman sachs gives, our donor-advised fund. compensation was reduced to fund this charitable contribution to goldman sachs gives. we ask our participating managing directors to make recommendations regarding potential charitable recipients for this contribution.
2015 versus 2014. operating expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings were $25.04 billion for 2015, 13% higher than 2014. compensation and benefits expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings were $12.68 billion for 2015, essentially unchanged compared with 2014. the ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues for 2015 was 37.5% compared with 36.8% for 2014. total staff increased 8% during 2015, primarily due to activity levels in certain businesses and continued investment in regulatory compliance.
non-compensation expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings were $12.36 billion for 2015, 30% higher than 2014, due to significantly higher net provisions for mortgage-related litigation and regulatory matters, which are included in other expenses. this increase was partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization expenses, primarily reflecting lower impairment charges related to consolidated investments, and a reduction in expenses related to the sale of metro in the fourth quarter of 2014. net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings for 2015 were $4.01 billion compared with $754 million for 2014 (both primarily comprised of net provisions for mortgage-related matters). 2015 included a $148 million charitable contribution to goldman sachs gives, our donor-advised fund. compensation was reduced to fund this charitable contribution to goldman sachs gives. we ask our participating managing directors to make recommendations regarding potential charitable recipients for this contribution.
provision for taxes the effective income tax rate for 2016 was 28.2%, down from 30.7% for 2015. the decline compared with 2015 was primarily due to the impact of non-deductible provisions for mortgage-related litigation and regulatory matters in 2015, partially offset by the impact of changes in tax law on deferred tax assets, the mix of earnings and an increase related to higher enacted tax rates impacting certain of our u.k. subsidiaries in 2016.
the effective income tax rate for 2015 was 30.7%, down from 31.4% for 2014. the decline compared with 2014 reflected reductions related to a change in the mix of earnings, the impact of changes in tax law on deferred tax assets, settlements of tax audits and the determination that certain non-u.s. earnings would be permanently reinvested abroad, and an increase related to the impact of non-deductible provisions for mortgage-related litigation and regulatory matters.
in september 2016, the u.k. government enacted a budget that will reduce the corporate income tax base rate by 1 percentage point effective april 1, 2020. during 2016, we remeasured deferred income tax assets accordingly. this change did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate for the year ended december 2016, and we do not expect it to have a material impact on our future effective tax rate.
the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis in october 2016, the u.s. department of the treasury issued rules under section 385 of the internal revenue code that could, in some circumstances, re-characterize debt as equity for u.s. federal income tax purposes. the rules contain exclusions applicable to, among other things, debt instruments issued by regulated financial companies, non-u.s. subsidiaries, certain u.s. subsidiaries where the holder of the debt instrument is included in a consolidated u.s. tax return, and ordinary business transactions. the rules also contain exclusions applicable to members of a regulated financial group other than subsidiaries held under the merchant banking authority, grandfathered commodities, or complementary activities under the bank holding company act of 1956. these exceptions would exclude from re-characterization substantially all debt instruments issued by us. we do not expect these rules to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, effective income tax rate or cash flows.

58   goldman sachs 2016 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis in the table above:
Â•                                                                         announced and completed mergers and acquisitions volumes are based on full credit to each of the advisors in a transaction. equity and equity-related offerings and debt offerings are based on full credit for single book managers and equal credit for joint book managers. transaction volumes may not be indicative of net revenues in a given period. in addition, transaction volumes for prior periods may vary from amounts previously reported due to the subsequent withdrawal or a change in the value of a transaction.
Â•   equity and equity-related offerings includes rule 144a and public common stock offerings, convertible offerings and rights offerings.
Â•   debt offerings includes non-convertible preferred stock, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and taxable municipal debt. includes publicly registered and rule 144a issues. excludes leveraged loans.
operating environment. in mergers and acquisitions, industry-wide completed activity remained strong for 2016 and industry-wide announced activity continued to be robust for most of the year, but both declined for the industry compared with the level of activity during 2015. in underwriting, industry-wide equity underwriting volumes decreased significantly compared with 2015, due to a continued weak backdrop for new issuances. this compares with strong activity levels in 2015, which benefited from favorable equity market conditions during the first half of the year. industry-wide debt underwriting volumes during 2016 increased compared with 2015. in the future, if industry-wide activity levels in mergers and acquisitions or equity underwriting continue the downward trend or if industry-wide activity levels in debt underwriting decline, net revenues in investment banking would likely continue to be negatively impacted.
during 2015, investment banking operated in an environment characterized by strong industry-wide mergers and acquisitions activity. industry-wide activity in both debt and equity underwriting declined compared with 2014.
2016 versus 2015. net revenues in investment banking were $6.27 billion for 2016, 11% lower compared with a strong 2015.
net revenues in financial advisory were $2.93 billion, 16% lower compared with a strong 2015, reflecting a decrease in industry-wide transactions. net revenues in underwriting were $3.34 billion, 6% lower compared with a strong 2015, due to significantly lower net revenues in equity underwriting, reflecting a decrease in industry-wide volumes. net revenues in debt underwriting were significantly higher, reflecting significantly higher net revenues from asset-backed activity and higher net revenues from leveraged finance activity.
operating expenses were $3.44 billion for 2016, 7% lower than 2015, due to decreased compensation and benefits expenses, reflecting lower net revenues. pre-tax earnings were $2.84 billion in 2016, 14% lower than 2015.
as of december 2016, our investment banking transaction backlog was lower compared with a strong level of backlog at the end of 2015, primarily due to lower estimated net revenues from potential advisory transactions and significantly lower estimated net revenues from potential debt underwriting transactions, principally reflecting decreases in mergers and acquisitions activity and acquisition-related financing, respectively. estimated net revenues from potential equity underwriting transactions were slightly lower compared with the end of 2015.
our investment banking transaction backlog represents an estimate of our future net revenues from investment banking transactions where we believe that future revenue realization is more likely than not. we believe changes in our investment banking transaction backlog may be a useful indicator of client activity levels which, over the long term, impact our net revenues. however, the time frame for completion and corresponding revenue recognition of transactions in our backlog varies based on the nature of the assignment, as certain transactions may remain in our backlog for longer periods of time and others may enter and leave within the same reporting period. in addition, our transaction backlog is subject to certain limitations, such as assumptions about the likelihood that individual client transactions will occur in the future. transactions may be cancelled or modified, and transactions not included in the estimate may also occur.
2015 versus 2014. net revenues in investment banking were $7.03 billion for 2015, 9% higher than 2014.
net revenues in financial advisory were $3.47 billion, 40% higher than 2014, reflecting strong client activity, particularly in the u.s. industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions increased significantly compared with the prior year. net revenues in underwriting were $3.56 billion, 11% lower compared with a strong 2014. net revenues in debt underwriting were lower compared with 2014, reflecting significantly lower leveraged finance activity. net revenues in equity underwriting were also lower, reflecting significantly lower net revenues from initial public offerings and convertible offerings, partially offset by significantly higher net revenues from secondary offerings.
operating expenses were $3.71 billion for 2015, essentially unchanged compared with 2014. pre-tax earnings were $3.31 billion in 2015, 19% higher than 2014.
the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis as of december 2015, our investment banking transaction backlog was higher compared with the end of 2014, primarily due to significantly higher estimated net revenues from potential debt underwriting transactions, principally related to leveraged finance transactions, and higher estimated net revenues from potential advisory transactions, reflecting the continued high level of mergers and acquisitions activity. estimated net revenues from potential equity underwriting transactions were slightly higher compared with the end of 2014.
institutional client services our institutional client services segment is comprised of:
fixed income, currency and commodities client execution. includes client execution activities related to making markets in both cash and derivative instruments for interest rate products, credit products, mortgages, currencies and commodities.
Â•                                                          interest rate products. government bonds (including inflation-linked securities) across maturities, other government-backed securities, repurchase agreements, and interest rate swaps, options and other derivatives.
Â•                                                          credit products. investment-grade corporate securities, high-yield securities, credit derivatives, exchange-traded funds, bank and bridge loans, municipal securities, emerging market and distressed debt, and trade claims.
Â•                                                                                               mortgages. commercial mortgage-related securities, loans and derivatives, residential mortgage-related securities, loans and derivatives (including u.s. government agency-issued collateralized mortgage obligations and other securities and loans), and other asset-backed securities, loans and derivatives.
Â•      currencies. currency options, spot/forwards and other derivatives on g-10 currencies and emerging-market products.
Â•                                                            commodities. commodity derivatives and, to a lesser extent, physical commodities, involving crude oil and petroleum products, natural gas, base, precious and other metals, electricity, coal, agricultural and other commodity products.
equities. includes client execution activities related to making markets in equity products and commissions and fees from executing and clearing institutional client transactions on major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide, as well as otc transactions. equities also includes our securities services business, which provides financing, securities lending and other prime brokerage services to institutional clients, including hedge funds, mutual funds, pension funds and foundations, and generates revenues primarily in the form of interest rate spreads or fees.
as a market maker, we facilitate transactions in both liquid and less liquid markets, primarily for institutional clients, such as corporations, financial institutions, investment funds and governments, to assist clients in meeting their investment objectives and in managing their risks. in this role, we seek to earn the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing to sell an instrument to us and the price at which another market participant is willing to buy it from us, and vice versa (i.e., bid/offer spread). in addition, we maintain inventory, typically for a short period of time, in response to, or in anticipation of, client demand. we also hold inventory to actively manage our risk exposures that arise from these market-making activities. our market-making inventory is recorded in financial instruments owned, at fair value (long positions) or financial instruments sold, but not yet purchased, at fair value (short positions) in our consolidated statements of financial condition.
our results are influenced by a combination of interconnected drivers, including (i) client activity levels and transactional bid/offer spreads (collectively, client activity), and (ii) changes in the fair value of our inventory and interest income and interest expense related to the holding, hedging and funding of our inventory (collectively, market-making inventory changes). due to the integrated nature of our market-making activities, disaggregation of net revenues into client activity and market-making inventory changes is judgmental and has inherent complexities and limitations.
the amount and composition of our net revenues vary over time as these drivers are impacted by multiple interrelated factors affecting economic and market conditions, including volatility and liquidity in the market, changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, credit spreads, equity prices and commodity prices, investor confidence, and other macroeconomic concerns and uncertainties.
in general, assuming all other market-making conditions remain constant, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads tend to result in increases in net revenues, and decreases tend to have the opposite effect. however, changes in market-making conditions can materially impact client activity levels and bid/offer spreads, as well as the fair value of our inventory. for example, a decrease in liquidity in the market could have the impact of (i) increasing our bid/offer spread, (ii) decreasing investor confidence and thereby decreasing client activity levels, and (iii) wider credit spreads on our inventory positions.

operating environment. challenging trends in the operating environment for institutional client services that existed throughout the second half of 2015 continued during the first quarter of 2016, including concerns and uncertainties about global economic growth and central bank activity. these concerns contributed to significant price pressure across both equity and fixed income markets. volatility peaked in february with the vix reaching over 28, and global equity markets materially declined during the first half of the first quarter with the dow jones industrial average, shanghai composite index, and nikkei 225 index down 10%, 25% and 21%, respectively, at their lowest points. credit spreads for high-yield issuers widened over 100 basis points early in the first quarter, driven by the energy sector, and oil and natural gas prices continued their downward trend that began during the middle of 2015, reaching as low as $26 per barrel (wti) and $1.64 per million british thermal units, respectively. concerns about global economic growth moderated at the beginning of the second quarter, however the market became increasingly focused on the political uncertainty and economic implications surrounding the potential exit of the u.k. from the e.u. in response to the "leave vote," the msci world index declined 7% in two days and volumes generally spiked, both of which largely reversed shortly thereafter. in addition, the nikkei 225 index and the shanghai composite index were down 18% and 17%, respectively, during the first half of 2016. this challenging environment, including low interest rates, impacted client sentiment and risk appetite, and market-making conditions remained difficult.
during the second half of 2016, the operating environment improved, as global equity markets steadily increased, with the msci world index up 6% and the s&p 500 index up 7% during the period. in addition, equity markets in asia generally rebounded, with the nikkei 225 index up 23% and the shanghai composite index up 6%. average volatility in equity markets was lower during the second half of 2016 compared with the beginning of the year. in credit and commodity markets, u.s. investment grade and high-yield credit spreads tightened by nearly 40 basis points and over 150 basis points, respectively, during the second half of 2016, and oil and natural gas prices increased to approximately $54 per barrel (wti) and $3.72 per million british thermal units, respectively. these trends drove improved client sentiment and market-making conditions during the second half of 2016. if the trend of macroeconomic concerns continues over the long term and activity levels decline, net revenues in institutional client services would likely continue to be negatively impacted. see "business environment" above for further information about economic and market conditions in the global operating environment during the year.
the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis during 2015, the operating environment for institutional client services was positively impacted by diverging central bank monetary policies in the u.s. and the euro area in the first quarter, as increased volatility levels contributed to strong client activity levels in currencies, interest rate products and equity products, and market-making conditions improved. however, during the remainder of 2015, concerns about global growth and uncertainty about the u.s. federal reserve's interest rate policy, along with lower global equity prices, widening high-yield credit spreads and declining commodity prices, contributed to lower levels of client activity, particularly in mortgages and credit, and more difficult market-making conditions.
2016 versus 2015. net revenues in institutional client services were $14.47 billion for 2016, 5% lower than 2015.
net revenues in fixed income, currency and commodities client execution were $7.56 billion for 2016, 3% higher than 2015. this increase was primarily driven by the impact of changes in market-making conditions on our inventory.
the following provides details of our fixed income, currency and commodities client execution net revenues by business, compared with 2015 results:
Â•    net revenues in credit products were significantly higher, reflecting improved market-making conditions, including generally tighter spreads, and higher client activity levels compared with low activity in 2015.
Â•   net revenues in interest rate products were higher, reflecting higher client activity levels.
Â•   net revenues in mortgages were significantly lower, reflecting less favorable market-making conditions, including generally wider spreads.
Â•   net revenues in currencies were lower, reflecting less favorable market-making conditions in emerging markets products compared with 2015, which included a strong first quarter of 2015.
Â•   net revenues in commodities were lower, reflecting significantly lower client activity.
net revenues in equities were $6.91 billion, 12% lower than 2015, primarily due to significantly lower net revenues in equities client execution, reflecting significantly lower net revenues in cash products, primarily in asia, as well as lower net revenues in derivatives. commissions and fees were slightly lower, reflecting lower listed cash equity volumes in asia and europe, consistent with market volumes in these regions, and net revenues in securities services were essentially unchanged compared with 2015.
we elect the fair value option for certain unsecured borrowings. for 2015, the fair value net gain attributable to the impact of changes in our credit spreads on these borrowings was $255 million ($214 million and $41 million related to fixed income, currency and commodities client execution and equities client execution, respectively). for 2016, we adopted the requirement in asu no. 2016-01 to present separately such gains and losses in other comprehensive income. the amount included in accumulated other comprehensive loss for 2016 was a loss of $844 million ($544 million, net of tax). see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about asu no. 2016-01.
operating expenses were $9.71 billion for 2016, 30% lower than 2015, primarily due to significantly lower net provisions for mortgage-related litigation and regulatory matters, and decreased compensation and benefits expenses, reflecting lower net revenues. pre-tax earnings were $4.75 billion in 2016 compared with $1.21 billion in 2015.
2015 versus 2014. net revenues in institutional client services were $15.15 billion for 2015, essentially unchanged compared with 2014.
net revenues in fixed income, currency and commodities client execution were $7.32 billion for 2015, 13% lower than 2014. excluding a gain of $168 million in 2014 related to the extinguishment of certain of our junior subordinated debt, net revenues in fixed income, currency and commodities client execution were 12% lower than 2014. this decrease was primarily driven by the impact of changes in market-making conditions on our inventory.
the following provides details of our fixed income, currency and commodities client execution net revenues by business, compared with 2014 results:
Â•   net revenues in mortgages and credit products were both significantly lower, reflecting challenging market-making conditions and generally low levels of activity during 2015.
Â•   net revenues in commodities were significantly lower, primarily reflecting less favorable market-making conditions compared with 2014, which included a strong first quarter of 2014.
Â•         net revenues in interest rate products and currencies were both significantly higher, reflecting higher volatility levels which contributed to higher client activity levels, particularly during the first quarter of 2015.
62   goldman sachs 2016 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis net revenues in equities were $7.83 billion for 2015, 16% higher than 2014. excluding a gain of $121 million ($30 million and $91 million included in equities client execution and securities services, respectively) in 2014 related to the extinguishment of certain of our junior subordinated debt, net revenues in equities were 18% higher than 2014, primarily due to significantly higher net revenues in equities client execution across the major regions, reflecting significantly higher results in both derivatives and cash products, and higher net revenues in securities services, reflecting the impact of higher average customer balances and improved securities lending spreads. commissions and fees were essentially unchanged compared with 2014.
we elect the fair value option for certain unsecured borrowings. the fair value net gain attributable to the impact of changes in our credit spreads on these borrowings was $255 million ($214 million and $41 million related to fixed income, currency and commodities client execution and equities client execution, respectively) for 2015, compared with a net gain of $144 million ($108 million and $36 million related to fixed income, currency and commodities client execution and equities client execution, respectively) for 2014.
operating expenses were $13.94 billion for 2015, 28% higher than 2014, due to significantly higher net provisions for mortgage-related litigation and regulatory matters, partially offset by decreased compensation and benefits expenses. pre-tax earnings were $1.21 billion in 2015, 72% lower than 2014.
investing & lending investing & lending includes our investing activities and the origination of loans, including our relationship lending activities, to provide financing to clients. these investments and loans are typically longer-term in nature. we make investments, some of which are consolidated, directly and indirectly through funds that we manage, in debt securities and loans, public and private equity securities, infrastructure and real estate entities. we also make unsecured loans to individuals through our online platform.

operating environment. following difficult market conditions and the impact of a challenging macroeconomic environment on corporate performance, particularly in the energy sector, in the first quarter of 2016, market conditions improved during the rest of the year as macroeconomic concerns moderated. global equity markets increased during 2016, contributing to net gains from investments in public equities, and corporate performance rebounded from the difficult start to the year. if macroeconomic concerns negatively affect corporate performance or company-specific events, or if global equity markets decline, net revenues in investing & lending would likely be negatively impacted.
although net revenues in investing & lending for 2015 benefited from favorable company-specific events, including sales, initial public offerings and financings, a decline in global equity prices and widening high-yield credit spreads during the second half of 2015 impacted results.
2016 versus 2015. net revenues in investing & lending were $4.08 billion for 2016, 25% lower than 2015. this decrease was primarily due to significantly lower net revenues from investments in equities, primarily reflecting a significant decrease in net gains from private equities, driven by company-specific events and corporate performance. in addition, net revenues in debt securities and loans were lower compared with 2015, reflecting significantly lower net revenues related to relationship lending activities, due to the impact of changes in credit spreads on economic hedges. losses related to these hedges were $596 million in 2016, compared with gains of $329 million in 2015. this decrease was partially offset by higher net gains from investments in debt instruments and higher net interest income. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about economic hedges related to our relationship lending activities.
operating expenses were $2.39 billion for 2016, essentially unchanged compared with 2015. pre-tax earnings were $1.69 billion in 2016, 44% lower than 2015.
2015 versus 2014. net revenues in investing & lending were $5.44 billion for 2015, 20% lower than 2014. this decrease was primarily due to lower net revenues from investments in equities, principally reflecting the sale of metro in the fourth quarter of 2014 and lower net gains from investments in private equities, driven by corporate performance. in addition, net revenues in debt securities and loans were significantly lower, reflecting lower net gains from investments.
the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis operating expenses were $2.40 billion for 2015, 15% lower than 2014, due to lower depreciation and amortization expenses, primarily reflecting lower impairment charges related to consolidated investments, and a reduction in expenses related to the sale of metro in the fourth quarter of 2014. pre-tax earnings were $3.03 billion in 2015, 24% lower than 2014.
investment management investment management provides investment management services and offers investment products (primarily through separately managed accounts and commingled vehicles, such as mutual funds and private investment funds) across all major asset classes to a diverse set of institutional and individual clients. investment management also offers wealth advisory services, including portfolio management and financial counseling, and brokerage and other transaction services to high-net-worth individuals and families.
assets under supervision (aus) include client assets where we earn a fee for managing assets on a discretionary basis. this includes net assets in our mutual funds, hedge funds, credit funds and private equity funds (including real estate funds), and separately managed accounts for institutional and individual investors. assets under supervision also include client assets invested with third-party managers, bank deposits and advisory relationships where we earn a fee for advisory and other services, but do not have investment discretion. assets under supervision do not include the self-directed brokerage assets of our clients. long-term assets under supervision represent assets under supervision excluding liquidity products. liquidity products represent money market and bank deposit assets.
assets under supervision typically generate fees as a percentage of net asset value, which vary by asset class and distribution channel and are affected by investment performance as well as asset inflows and redemptions. asset classes such as alternative investment and equity assets typically generate higher fees relative to fixed income and liquidity product assets. the average effective management fee (which excludes non-asset-based fees) we earned on our assets under supervision was 35 basis points for 2016, 39 basis points for 2015 and 40 basis points for 2014. these decreases reflected shifts in the mix of client assets and strategies.
in certain circumstances, we are also entitled to receive incentive fees based on a percentage of a fund's or a separately managed account's return, or when the return exceeds a specified benchmark or other performance targets. incentive fees are recognized only when all material contingencies are resolved.

operating environment. following a challenging first quarter of 2016, market conditions continued to improve with higher asset prices resulting in full year appreciation in our client assets in both equity and fixed income assets. also, our assets under supervision increased during 2016 from net inflows, primarily in fixed income assets, and liquidity products. the mix of our average assets under supervision shifted slightly compared with 2015 from long-term assets under supervision to liquidity products. management fees have been impacted by many factors, including inflows to advisory services and outflows from actively-managed mutual funds. in the future, if asset prices decline, or investors continue the trend of favoring assets that typically generate lower fees or investors withdraw their assets, net revenues in investment management would likely be negatively impacted.
during 2015, investment management operated in an environment generally characterized by strong client net inflows, which more than offset the declines in equity and fixed income asset prices, which resulted in depreciation in the value of client assets, particularly in the third quarter of 2015. the mix of average assets under supervision shifted slightly from long-term assets under supervision to liquidity products compared with 2014.
2016 versus 2015. net revenues in investment management were $5.79 billion for 2016, 7% lower than 2015. this decrease primarily reflected significantly lower incentive fees compared with a strong 2015. in addition, management and other fees were slightly lower, reflecting shifts in the mix of client assets and strategies, partially offset by the impact of higher average assets under supervision. during the year, total assets under supervision increased $127 billion to $1.38 trillion. long-term assets under supervision increased $75 billion, including net inflows of $42 billion, primarily in fixed income assets, and net market appreciation of $33 billion, primarily in equity and fixed income assets. in addition, liquidity products increased $52 billion.
operating expenses were $4.65 billion for 2016, 4% lower than 2015, due to decreased compensation and benefits expenses, reflecting lower net revenues. pre-tax earnings were $1.13 billion in 2016, 17% lower than 2015.
2015 versus 2014. net revenues in investment management were $6.21 billion for 2015, 3% higher than 2014, due to slightly higher management and other fees, primarily reflecting higher average assets under supervision, and higher transaction revenues. during 2015, total assets under supervision increased $74 billion to $1.25 trillion. long-term assets under supervision increased $51 billion, including net inflows of $71 billion (which includes $18 billion of asset inflows in connection with our acquisition of pacific global advisors' solutions business), and net market depreciation of $20 billion, both primarily in fixed income and equity assets. in addition, liquidity products increased $23 billion.
operating expenses were $4.84 billion for 2015, 4% higher than 2014, due to increased compensation and benefits expenses, reflecting higher net revenues. pre-tax earnings were $1.37 billion in 2015, 2% lower than 2014.

the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis balance sheet and funding sources balance sheet management one of our risk management disciplines is our ability to manage the size and composition of our balance sheet. while our asset base changes due to client activity, market fluctuations and business opportunities, the size and composition of our balance sheet also reflects factors including (i) our overall risk tolerance, (ii) the amount of equity capital we hold and (iii) our funding profile, among other factors. see "equity capital management and regulatory capital Â— equity capital management" for information about our equity capital management process.
although our balance sheet fluctuates on a day-to-day basis, our total assets at quarter-end and year-end dates are generally not materially different from those occurring within our reporting periods.
in order to ensure appropriate risk management, we seek to maintain a sufficiently liquid balance sheet and have processes in place to dynamically manage our assets and liabilities which include (i) balance sheet planning, (ii) business-specific limits, (iii) monitoring of key metrics and (iv) scenario analyses.
balance sheet planning. we prepare a balance sheet plan that combines our projected total assets and composition of assets with our expected funding sources over a one-year time horizon. this plan is reviewed semi-annually and may be adjusted in response to changing business needs or market conditions. the objectives of this planning process are:
Â•   to develop our balance sheet projections, taking into account the general state of the financial markets and expected business activity levels, as well as regulatory requirements;
Â•                                               to allow business risk managers and managers from our independent control and support functions to objectively evaluate balance sheet limit requests from business managers in the context of our overall balance sheet constraints, including our liability profile and equity capital levels, and key metrics; and
Â•   to inform the target amount, tenor and type of funding to raise, based on our projected assets and contractual maturities.
business risk managers and managers from our independent control and support functions meet with business managers to review current and prior period information and discuss expectations for the year to prepare our balance sheet plan. the specific information reviewed includes asset and liability size and composition, limit utilization, risk and performance measures, and capital usage.
our consolidated balance sheet plan, including our balance sheets by business, funding projections, and projected key metrics, is reviewed and approved by the firmwide finance committee. see "overview and structure of risk management" for an overview of our risk management structure.
business-specific limits. the firmwide finance committee sets asset and liability limits for each business. these limits are set at levels which are close to actual operating levels, rather than at levels which reflect our maximum risk appetite, in order to ensure prompt escalation and discussion among business managers and managers in our independent control and support functions on a routine basis. the firmwide finance committee reviews and approves balance sheet limits on a semi-annual basis and may also approve changes in limits on a more frequent basis in response to changing business needs or market conditions. in addition, the risk governance committee sets aged inventory limits for certain financial instruments as a disincentive to hold inventory over longer periods of time. requests for changes in limits are evaluated after giving consideration to their impact on key firm metrics. compliance with limits is monitored on a daily basis by business risk managers, as well as managers in our independent control and support functions.
monitoring of key metrics. we monitor key balance sheet metrics daily both by business and on a consolidated basis, including asset and liability size and composition, limit utilization and risk measures. we allocate assets to businesses and review and analyze movements resulting from new business activity as well as market fluctuations.
66   goldman sachs 2016 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis scenario analyses. we conduct various scenario analyses including as part of the comprehensive capital analysis and review (ccar) and dodd-frank act stress tests (dfast), as well as our resolution and recovery planning. see "equity capital management and regulatory capital Â— equity capital management" below for further information about these scenario analyses. these scenarios cover short-term and long-term time horizons using various macroeconomic and firm-specific assumptions, based on a range of economic scenarios. we use these analyses to assist us in developing our longer-term balance sheet management strategy, including the level and composition of assets, funding and equity capital. additionally, these analyses help us develop approaches for maintaining appropriate funding, liquidity and capital across a variety of situations, including a severely stressed environment.
balance sheet allocation in addition to preparing our consolidated statements of financial condition in accordance with u.s. gaap, we prepare a balance sheet that generally allocates assets to our businesses, which is a non-gaap presentation and may not be comparable to similar non-gaap presentations used by other companies. we believe that presenting our assets on this basis is meaningful because it is consistent with the way management views and manages risks associated with our assets and better enables investors to assess the liquidity of our assets.
the table below presents our balance sheet allocation.

Â•                                                                                               institutional client services. in institutional client services, we maintain inventory positions to facilitate market making in fixed income, equity, currency and commodity products. additionally, as part of market-making activities, we enter into resale or securities borrowing arrangements to obtain securities or use our own inventory to cover transactions in which we or our clients have sold securities that have not yet been purchased. the receivables in institutional client services primarily relate to securities transactions.
Â•                                                                                                    investing &amp; lending. in investing &amp; lending, we make investments and originate loans to provide financing to clients. these investments and loans are typically longer-term in nature. we make investments, directly and indirectly through funds that we manage, in debt securities, loans, public and private equity securities, infrastructure, real estate entities and other investments. we also make unsecured loans to individuals through our online platform. debt includes $14.23 billion and $17.29 billion as of december 2016
and december 2015, respectively, of direct loans primarily extended to corporate and private wealth management clients that are accounted for at fair value. loans receivable is comprised of loans held for investment that are accounted for at amortized cost net of allowance for loan losses. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about loans receivable.

Â•   see "balance sheet analysis and metrics" for explanations on the changes in our balance sheet from december 2015 to december 2016.
balance sheet analysis and metrics as of december 2016, total assets in our consolidated statements of financial condition were $860.17 billion, essentially unchanged from december 2015, reflecting an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $28.27 billion, offset by a decrease in financial instruments owned, at fair value of $17.55 billion and a net decrease in collateralized agreements of $10.42 billion. the increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to an increase in deposits, reflecting the acquisition of ge capital bank's online deposit platform. the decrease in financial instruments owned, at fair value primarily reflected decreases in u.s. government and federal agency obligations, equities and convertible debentures and money market instruments related to market-making activity, and the net decrease in collateralized agreements reflected the impact of firm and client activity.
as of december 2016, total liabilities in our consolidated statements of financial condition were $773.27 billion, essentially unchanged from december 2015, reflecting increases in deposits of $26.58 billion and unsecured long-term borrowings of $13.66 billion, offset by decreases in payables to customers and counterparties of $20.89 billion, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, at fair value of $14.25 billion, and other liabilities and accrued expenses of $4.53 billion. the increase in deposits reflected the acquisition of ge capital bank's online deposit platform, and the increase in unsecured long-term borrowings was due to net new issuances. the decrease in payables to customers and counterparties reflected changes in client activity and the decrease in securities sold under agreements to repurchase, at fair value reflected the impact of firm and client activity. the decrease in other liabilities and accrued expenses primarily reflected payments related to the settlement agreement with the rmbs working group.
as of december 2016, our total securities sold under agreements to repurchase, accounted for as collateralized financings, were $71.82 billion, which was 5% lower and 9% lower than the daily average amount of repurchase agreements during the quarter ended and year ended december 2016, respectively. the decrease in our repurchase agreements relative to the daily average during 2016 resulted from the impact of firm and client activity at the end of the year.
68   goldman sachs 2016 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis as of december 2015, our total securities sold under agreements to repurchase, accounted for as collateralized financings, were $86.07 billion, which was 3% higher than the daily average amount of repurchase agreements during both the quarter ended and year ended december 2015. the increase in our repurchase agreements relative to the daily average during 2015 resulted from an increase in firm financing and client activity at the end of the year.
the level of our repurchase agreements fluctuates between and within periods, primarily due to providing clients with access to highly liquid collateral, such as u.s. government and federal agency, and investment-grade sovereign obligations through collateralized financing activities.

funding sources our primary sources of funding are secured financings, unsecured long-term and short-term borrowings, and deposits. we seek to maintain broad and diversified funding sources globally across products, programs, markets, currencies and creditors to avoid funding concentrations.
we raise funding through a number of different products, including:
Â•   collateralized financings, such as repurchase agreements, securities loaned and other secured financings;
Â•        long-term unsecured debt (including structured notes) through syndicated u.s. registered offerings, u.s.
registered and rule 144a medium-term note programs, offshore medium-term note offerings and other debt offerings;
Â•   savings, demand and time deposits through internal and third-party broker-dealers, as well as from retail and institutional customers; and
Â•   short-term unsecured debt at the subsidiary level through u.s. and non-u.s. hybrid financial instruments and other methods.
the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis our funding is primarily raised in u.s. dollar, euro, british pound and japanese yen. we generally distribute our funding products through our own sales force and third-party distributors to a large, diverse creditor base in a variety of markets in the americas, europe and asia. we believe that our relationships with our creditors are critical to our liquidity. our creditors include banks, governments, securities lenders, pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds and individuals. we have imposed various internal guidelines to monitor creditor concentration across our funding programs.
secured funding. we fund a significant amount of inventory on a secured basis, including repurchase agreements, securities loaned and other secured financings. as of december 2016 and december 2015, secured funding included in "collateralized financings" in the consolidated statements of financial condition was $100.86 billion and $114.44 billion, respectively. we may also pledge our inventory as collateral for securities borrowed under a securities lending agreement or as collateral for derivative transactions. we also use our own inventory to cover transactions in which we or our clients have sold securities that have not yet been purchased. secured funding is less sensitive to changes in our credit quality than unsecured funding, due to our posting of collateral to our lenders. nonetheless, we continually analyze the refinancing risk of our secured funding activities, taking into account trade tenors, maturity profiles, counterparty concentrations, collateral eligibility and counterparty rollover probabilities. we seek to mitigate our refinancing risk by executing term trades with staggered maturities, diversifying counterparties, raising excess secured funding, and pre-funding residual risk through our gcla.
we seek to raise secured funding with a term appropriate for the liquidity of the assets that are being financed, and we seek longer maturities for secured funding collateralized by asset classes that may be harder to fund on a secured basis, especially during times of market stress. our secured funding, excluding funding collateralized by liquid government obligations, is primarily executed for tenors of one month or greater. assets that may be harder to fund on a secured basis during times of market stress include certain financial instruments in the following categories: mortgage and other asset-backed loans and securities, non-investment-grade corporate debt securities, equities and convertible debentures and emerging market securities. assets that are classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy are generally funded on an unsecured basis. see notes 5 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the classification of financial instruments in the fair value hierarchy and "unsecured long-term borrowings" below for further information about the use of unsecured long-term borrowings as a source of funding.
the weighted average maturity of our secured funding included in "collateralized financings" in the consolidated statements of financial condition, excluding funding that can only be collateralized by highly liquid securities eligible for inclusion in our gcla, exceeded 120 days as of december 2016.
a majority of our secured funding for securities not eligible for inclusion in the gcla is executed through term repurchase agreements and securities loaned contracts. we also raise financing through other types of collateralized financings, such as secured loans and notes. goldman sachs bank usa (gs bank usa) has access to funding from the federal home loan bank (fhlb). as of december 2016, our outstanding borrowings against the fhlb were $2.43 billion.
gs bank usa also has access to funding through the federal reserve bank discount window. while we do not rely on this funding in our liquidity planning and stress testing, we maintain policies and procedures necessary to access this funding and test discount window borrowing procedures.
unsecured long-term borrowings. we issue unsecured long-term borrowings as a source of funding for inventory and other assets and to finance a portion of our gcla. we issue in different tenors, currencies and products to maximize the diversification of our investor base.

the weighted average maturity of our unsecured long-term borrowings as of december 2016 was approximately eight years. to mitigate refinancing risk, we seek to limit the principal amount of debt maturing on any one day or during any week or year. we enter into interest rate swaps to convert a portion of our unsecured long-term borrowings into floating-rate obligations in order to manage our exposure to interest rates. see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our unsecured long-term borrowings.
70   goldman sachs 2016 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis deposits. our deposits provide us with a diversified source of liquidity and reduce our reliance on wholesale funding. a growing source of our deposit base is comprised of retail deposits. deposits are primarily used to finance lending activity, other inventory and a portion of our gcla. we raise deposits primarily through gs bank usa and goldman sachs international bank (gsib). as of december 2016 and december 2015, our deposits were $124.10 billion and $97.52 billion, respectively. see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our deposits.
unsecured short-term borrowings. a significant portion of our unsecured short-term borrowings was originally long-term debt that is scheduled to mature within one year of the reporting date. we use unsecured short-term borrowings, including hybrid financial instruments, to finance liquid assets and for other cash management purposes. in light of regulatory developments, group inc. no longer issues debt with an original maturity of less than one year, other than to its subsidiaries.
as of december 2016 and december 2015, our unsecured short-term borrowings, including the current portion of unsecured long-term borrowings, were $39.27 billion and $42.79 billion, respectively. see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our unsecured short-term borrowings.
equity capital management and regulatory capital capital adequacy is of critical importance to us. we have in place a comprehensive capital management policy that provides a framework, defines objectives and establishes guidelines to assist us in maintaining the appropriate level and composition of capital in both business-as-usual and stressed conditions.
equity capital management we determine the appropriate level and composition of our equity capital by considering multiple factors including our current and future consolidated regulatory capital requirements, the results of our capital planning and stress testing process and other factors such as rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, the business environment and conditions in the financial markets. we manage our capital requirements and the levels of our capital usage principally by setting limits on balance sheet assets and/or limits on risk, in each case at both the consolidated and business levels.
we principally manage the level and composition of our equity capital through issuances and repurchases of our common stock. we may also, from time to time, issue or repurchase our preferred stock, junior subordinated debt issued to trusts, and other subordinated debt or other forms of capital as business conditions warrant. prior to any repurchases, we must receive confirmation that the board of governors of the federal reserve system (federal reserve board) does not object to such capital actions. see notes 16 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our preferred stock, junior subordinated debt issued to trusts and other subordinated debt.
capital planning and stress testing process. as part of capital planning, we project sources and uses of capital given a range of business environments, including stressed conditions. our stress testing process is designed to identify and measure material risks associated with our business activities including market risk, credit risk and operational risk, as well as our ability to generate revenues.
the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis the following is a description of our capital planning and stress testing process:
Â•                                                                                              capital planning. our capital planning process incorporates an internal capital adequacy assessment with the objective of ensuring that we are appropriately capitalized relative to the risks in our business. we incorporate stress scenarios into our capital planning process with a goal of holding sufficient capital to ensure we remain adequately capitalized after experiencing a severe stress event. our assessment of capital adequacy is viewed in tandem with our assessment of liquidity adequacy and is integrated into our overall risk management structure, governance and policy framework.
our capital planning process also includes an internal risk-based capital assessment. this assessment incorporates market risk, credit risk and operational risk. market risk is calculated by using value-at-risk (var) calculations supplemented by risk-based add-ons which include risks related to rare events (tail risks). credit risk utilizes assumptions about our counterparties' probability of default and the size of our losses in the event of a default. operational risk is calculated based on scenarios incorporating multiple types of operational failures as well as considering internal and external actual loss experience. backtesting for market risk and credit risk is used to gauge the effectiveness of models at capturing and measuring relevant risks.
Â•                                                                                                 stress testing. our stress tests incorporate our internally designed stress scenarios, including our internally developed severely adverse scenario, and those required under ccar and dfast, and are designed to capture our specific vulnerabilities and risks. we provide additional information about our stress test processes and a summary of the results on our website as described in "business Â— available information" in part i, item 1 of this form 10-k.
as required by the federal reserve board's annual ccar rules, we submit a capital plan for review by the federal reserve board. the purpose of the federal reserve board's review is to ensure that we have a robust, forward-looking capital planning process that accounts for our unique risks and that permits continued operation during times of economic and financial stress.
the federal reserve board evaluates us based, in part, on whether we have the capital necessary to continue operating under the baseline and stress scenarios provided by the federal reserve board and those developed internally. this evaluation also takes into account our process for identifying risk, our controls and governance for capital planning, and our guidelines for making capital planning decisions. in addition, the federal reserve board evaluates our plan to make capital distributions (i.e., dividend payments and repurchases or redemptions of stock, subordinated debt or other capital securities) and issue capital, across a range of macroeconomic scenarios and firm-specific assumptions.
in addition, the dfast rules require us to conduct stress tests on a semi-annual basis and publish a summary of certain results. the federal reserve board also conducts its own annual stress tests and publishes a summary of certain results.
we submitted our 2016 ccar results in april 2016 and the federal reserve board informed us that it did not object to our capital actions, including the potential repurchase of outstanding common stock, a potential increase in our quarterly common stock dividend and the possible issuance, redemption and modification of other capital securities from the third quarter of 2016 through the second quarter of 2017. we published a summary of our annual dfast results in june 2016. see "business Â— available information" in part i, item 1 of this form 10-k.
in september 2016, we submitted our semi-annual dfast results to the federal reserve board and subsequently published a summary of our internally developed severely adverse scenario results in october 2016. see "business Â— available information" in part i, item 1 of this form 10-k.
we are required to submit our 2017 ccar results to the federal reserve board by april 5, 2017.
in addition, the rules adopted by the federal reserve board under the dodd-frank act require gs bank usa to conduct stress tests on an annual basis and publish a summary of certain results. gs bank usa submitted its 2016 annual dfast stress results to the federal reserve board in april 2016 and published a summary of its results in june 2016. see "business Â— available information" in part i, item 1 of this form 10-k.
72   goldman sachs 2016 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis goldman sachs international (gsi) also has its own capital planning and stress testing process, which incorporates internally designed stress tests and those required under the prudential regulation authority's (pra) internal capital adequacy assessment process.
contingency capital plan. as part of our comprehensive capital management policy, we maintain a contingency capital plan. our contingency capital plan provides a framework for analyzing and responding to a perceived or actual capital deficiency, including, but not limited to, identification of drivers of a capital deficiency, as well as mitigants and potential actions. it outlines the appropriate communication procedures to follow during a crisis period, including internal dissemination of information as well as timely communication with external stakeholders.
capital attribution. we assess each of our businesses' capital usage based upon our internal assessment of risks, which incorporates an attribution of all of our relevant regulatory capital requirements. these regulatory capital requirements are allocated using our attributed equity framework, which takes into consideration our binding capital constraints. we also attribute risk-weighted assets (rwas) to our business segments. as of december 2016, approximately two-thirds of rwas calculated in accordance with the standardized capital rules and the basel iii advanced rules, subject to transitional provisions, were attributed to our institutional client services segment and substantially all of the remaining rwas were attributed to our investing & lending segment. we manage the levels of our capital usage based upon balance sheet and risk limits, as well as capital return analyses of our businesses based on our capital attribution.
share repurchase program. we use our share repurchase program to help maintain the appropriate level of common equity. the repurchase program is effected primarily through regular open-market purchases (which may include repurchase plans designed to comply with rule 10b5-1), the amounts and timing of which are determined primarily by our current and projected capital position and our capital plan submitted to the federal reserve board as part of ccar. the amounts and timing of the repurchases may also be influenced by general market conditions and the prevailing price and trading volumes of our common stock.
as of december 2016, the remaining share authorization under our existing repurchase program was 26.6 million shares; however, we are only permitted to make repurchases to the extent that such repurchases have not been objected to by the federal reserve board. see "market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities" in part ii, item 5 of this form 10-k and note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our share repurchase program and see above for information about our capital planning and stress testing process.
resolution and recovery plans we are required by the federal reserve board and the fdic to submit a periodic plan that describes our strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure (resolution plan). we are also required by the federal reserve board to submit and have submitted, on a periodic basis, a global recovery plan that outlines the steps that management could take to reduce risk, maintain sufficient liquidity, and conserve capital in times of prolonged stress.
in april 2016, the federal reserve board and the fdic provided feedback on the 2015 resolution plans of eight systemically important domestic banking institutions and provided guidance related to the 2017 resolution plan submissions. while our plan was not jointly found to be deficient (i.e., non-credible or to not facilitate an orderly resolution under the u.s. bankruptcy code), the fdic identified deficiencies and both the fdic and federal reserve board also identified certain shortcomings. in response to the feedback received, in september 2016, we submitted a status report on our actions to address these shortcomings and a separate public section that explains these actions, at a high level. our 2017 resolution plan, which is due by july 1, 2017, is also required to address the shortcomings and take into account the additional guidance.
in addition, gs bank usa is required to submit a resolution plan to the fdic and, accordingly, submitted its 2015 resolution plan on september 1, 2015. gs bank usa has not yet received supervisory feedback on its 2015 resolution plan. in july 2016, gs bank usa received notification from the fdic that its resolution plan submission date was extended to october 1, 2017 and the 2016 resolution plan requirement will be satisfied by the submission of the 2017 resolution plan.
the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis rating agency guidelines the credit rating agencies assign credit ratings to the obligations of group inc., which directly issues or guarantees substantially all of our senior unsecured obligations. goldman, sachs & co. (gs&co.) and gsi have been assigned long- and short-term issuer ratings by certain credit rating agencies. gs bank usa and gsib have also been assigned long- and short-term issuer ratings, as well as ratings on their long-term and short-term bank deposits. in addition, credit rating agencies have assigned ratings to debt obligations of certain other subsidiaries of group inc.
the level and composition of our equity capital are among the many factors considered in determining our credit ratings. each agency has its own definition of eligible capital and methodology for evaluating capital adequacy, and assessments are generally based on a combination of factors rather than a single calculation. see "liquidity risk management Â— credit ratings" for further information about credit ratings of group inc., gs bank usa, gsib, gs&co. and gsi.
consolidated regulatory capital we are subject to the federal reserve board's revised risk-based capital and leverage regulations, subject to certain transitional provisions (revised capital framework). these regulations are largely based on the basel committee on banking supervision's (basel committee) capital framework for strengthening international capital standards (basel iii) and also implement certain provisions of the dodd-frank act. under the revised capital framework, we are an "advanced approach" banking organization.
we calculate our common equity tier 1 (cet1), tier 1 capital and total capital ratios in accordance with (i) the standardized approach and market risk rules set out in the revised capital framework (together, the standardized capital rules) and (ii) the advanced approach and market risk rules set out in the revised capital framework (together, the basel iii advanced rules) as described in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements. the lower of each ratio calculated in (i) and (ii) is the ratio against which our compliance with minimum ratio requirements is assessed. each of the ratios calculated in accordance with the basel iii advanced rules was lower than that calculated in accordance with the standardized capital rules and therefore the basel iii advanced ratios were the ratios that applied to us as of december 2016 and december 2015.
see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our capital ratios as of december 2016 and december 2015, and for additional information about the revised capital framework.
minimum capital ratios and capital buffers the table below presents our minimum required ratios as of december 2016, as well as the estimated minimum ratios that we expect will apply at the end of the transitional provisions beginning january 2019.

tier 1 leverage ratio          4.000%            4.0%
in the table above:
Â•                                       the minimum ratios as of december 2016 reflect (i) the 25% phase-in of the capital conservation buffer (0.625%), (ii) the 25% phase-in of the global systemically important bank (g-sib) buffer (0.75%), and (iii) the counter-cyclical capital buffer of zero percent.
Â•                                                                      the estimated minimum ratios as of january 2019 reflect (i) the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer (2.5%), (ii) the fully phased-in g-sib buffer (2.5%), and (iii) the counter-cyclical capital buffer of zero percent. the g-sib buffer of 2.5% is estimated based on 2016 financial data, a reduction from the 3.0% buffer effective january 1, 2016. the g-sib and counter-cyclical buffers in the future may differ from these estimates due to additional guidance from our regulators and/or positional changes. as a result, the minimum ratios we are subject to as of january 1, 2019 could be higher than the amounts presented in the table above.
Â•                               as of december 2016, in order to meet the quantitative requirements for being
"well-capitalized" under the federal reserve board's regulations, we must meet a higher required minimum total capital ratio of 10.0%.
Â•                                tier 1 leverage ratio is defined as tier 1 capital divided by quarterly average adjusted total assets (which includes adjustments for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, and certain investments in nonconsolidated financial institutions).
see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for information about the capital conservation buffer, the current g-sib buffer and the counter-cyclical capital buffer.
our minimum required supplementary leverage ratio will be 5.0% on january 1, 2018. see "supplementary leverage ratio" below for further information.

although the fully phased-in capital ratios are not applicable until 2019, we believe that the ratios in the table above are meaningful because they are measures that we, our regulators and investors use to assess our ability to meet future regulatory capital requirements. the fully phased-in basel iii advanced and standardized capital ratios are non-gaap measures and may not be comparable to similar non-gaap measures used by other companies. these ratios are based on our current interpretation, expectations and understanding of the revised capital framework and may evolve as we discuss the interpretation and application of this framework with our regulators.
in the table above:
Â•                                                     the deductions for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, include goodwill of $3.67 billion and $3.66 billion as of december 2016 and december 2015, respectively, and identifiable intangible assets of $429 million and $491 million as of december 2016 and december 2015, respectively, net of associated deferred tax liabilities of $1.08 billion and $1.10 billion as of december 2016 and december 2015, respectively.
Â•                                                       the deductions for investments in nonconsolidated financial institutions represent the amount by which our investments in the capital of nonconsolidated financial institutions exceed certain prescribed thresholds. the decrease from december 2015 to december 2016 primarily reflects reductions in our fund investments.

the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis supplementary leverage ratio the revised capital framework includes a supplementary leverage ratio requirement for advanced approach banking organizations. under amendments to the revised capital framework, the u.s. federal bank regulatory agencies approved a final rule that implements the supplementary leverage ratio aligned with the definition of leverage established by the basel committee. the supplementary leverage ratio compares tier 1 capital to a measure of leverage exposure, which consists of total daily average assets for the quarter and certain off-balance-sheet exposures (which include a measure of derivatives exposures and commitments), less certain balance sheet deductions. the revised capital framework requires a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 5.0% (comprised of the minimum requirement of 3.0% and a 2.0% buffer) for u.s. bank holding companies deemed to be g-sibs, effective on january 1, 2018.
as of december 2016 and december 2015, our supplementary leverage ratio was 6.4% and 5.9%, respectively, based on tier 1 capital on a fully phased-in basis of $81.81 billion and $79.46 billion, respectively, divided by total leverage exposure of $1.27 trillion (consists of total daily average assets for the quarter of $884 billion and certain off-balance-sheet exposures of $392 billion, less certain balance sheet deductions of $5 billion) and $1.34 trillion (consists of total daily average assets for the quarter of $878 billion and certain off-balance-sheet exposures of $471 billion, less certain balance sheet deductions of $6 billion), respectively. within total leverage exposure, the adjustments to quarterly average assets in both periods were primarily comprised of off-balance-sheet exposures related to derivatives, secured financing transactions, commitments and guarantees.
this supplementary leverage ratio is based on our current interpretation and understanding of the u.s. federal bank regulatory agencies' final rule and may evolve as we discuss the interpretation and application of this rule with our regulators.
subsidiary capital requirements many of our subsidiaries, including gs bank usa and our broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to separate regulation and capital requirements of the jurisdictions in which they operate.
gs bank usa. gs bank usa is subject to regulatory capital requirements that are calculated in substantially the same manner as those applicable to bank holding companies and calculates its capital ratios in accordance with the risk-based capital and leverage requirements applicable to state member banks, which are based on the revised capital framework. see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the revised capital framework as it relates to gs bank usa, including gs bank usa's capital ratios and required minimum ratios.
in addition, under federal reserve board rules, commencing on january 1, 2018, in order to be considered a "well-capitalized" depository institution, gs bank usa must have a supplementary leverage ratio of 6.0% or greater. the supplementary leverage ratio compares tier 1 capital to a measure of leverage exposure, defined as total daily average assets for the quarter and certain off-balance-sheet exposures (which include a measure of derivatives exposures and commitments), less certain balance sheet deductions. as of december 2016, gs bank usa's supplementary leverage ratio was 7.3%, based on tier 1 capital on a fully phased-in basis of $24.48 billion, divided by total leverage exposure of $333 billion (consists of total daily average assets for the quarter of $170 billion and certain off-balance-sheet exposures of $163 billion, less certain balance sheet deductions of $20 million). as of december 2015, gs bank usa's supplementary leverage ratio was 7.1%, based on tier 1 capital on a fully phased-in basis of $23.02 billion, divided by total leverage exposure of $324 billion (total daily average assets for the quarter of $134 billion and certain off-balance-sheet exposures of $190 billion, less certain balance sheet deductions of $5 million). this supplementary leverage ratio is based on our current interpretation and understanding of this rule and may evolve as we discuss their interpretation and application with our regulators.
gsi. our regulated u.k. broker-dealer, gsi, is one of our principal non-u.s. regulated subsidiaries and is regulated by the pra and the financial conduct authority. gsi is subject to the revised capital framework for e.u.-regulated financial institutions prescribed in the e.u. fourth capital requirements directive (crd iv) and the e.u. capital requirements regulation (crr). these capital regulations are largely based on basel iii.
76   goldman sachs 2016 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis the table below presents gsi's minimum required ratios.
december 2016   december 2015
minimum ratio   minimum ratio cet1 ratio                    6.549%            6.1%
tier 1 capital ratio          8.530%            8.2%
total capital ratio          11.163%           10.9%
the minimum ratios in the table above incorporate capital guidance received from the pra and could change in the future. gsi's future capital requirements may also be impacted by developments such as the introduction of capital buffers as described above in "minimum capital ratios and capital buffers."
as of december 2016, gsi had a cet1 ratio of 12.9%, a tier 1 capital ratio of 12.9% and a total capital ratio of 17.2%. each of these ratios includes approximately 71 basis points attributable to profit for the year ended december 2016. these ratios will be finalized upon the completion of gsi's 2016 audit. as of december 2015, gsi had a cet1 ratio of 12.9%, a tier 1 capital ratio of 12.9% and a total capital ratio of 17.6%.
in november 2016, the european commission proposed amendments to the crr to implement a 3% minimum leverage ratio requirement for certain e.u. financial institutions. this leverage ratio compares the crr's definition of tier 1 capital to a measure of leverage exposure, defined as the sum of assets plus certain off-balance-sheet exposures (which include a measure of derivatives exposures, securities financing transactions and commitments), less tier 1 capital deductions. any required minimum ratio is expected to become effective for gsi no earlier than january 1, 2018. as of december 2016 and december 2015, gsi had a leverage ratio of 3.8% and 3.6%, respectively. the ratio as of december 2016 includes approximately 21 basis points attributable to profit for the year ended december 2016. this leverage ratio is based on our current interpretation and understanding of this rule and may evolve as we discuss the interpretation and application of this rule with gsi's regulators.
other subsidiaries. the capital requirements of several of our subsidiaries may increase in the future due to the various developments arising from the basel committee, the dodd-frank act, and other governmental entities and regulators. see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for information about the capital requirements of our other regulated subsidiaries.
subsidiaries not subject to separate regulatory capital requirements may hold capital to satisfy local tax and legal guidelines, rating agency requirements (for entities with assigned credit ratings) or internal policies, including policies concerning the minimum amount of capital a subsidiary should hold based on its underlying level of risk. in certain instances, group inc. may be limited in its ability to access capital held at certain subsidiaries as a result of regulatory, tax or other constraints. as of december 2016 and december 2015, group inc.'s equity investment in subsidiaries was $92.77 billion and $85.52 billion, respectively, compared with its total shareholders' equity of $86.89 billion and $86.73 billion, respectively.
our capital invested in non-u.s. subsidiaries is generally exposed to foreign exchange risk, substantially all of which is managed through a combination of derivatives and non-u.s. denominated debt. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for information about our net investment hedges, which are used to hedge this risk.
guarantees of subsidiaries. group inc. has guaranteed the payment obligations of gs&co. and gs bank usa, in each case subject to certain exceptions.
regulatory developments our businesses are subject to significant and evolving regulation. the dodd-frank act, enacted in july 2010, significantly altered the financial regulatory regime within which we operate. in addition, other reforms have been adopted or are being considered by regulators and policy makers worldwide. given that many of the new and proposed rules are highly complex, the full impact of regulatory reform will not be known until the rules are implemented and market practices develop under the final regulations.
there has been increased regulation of, and limitations on, our activities, including the dodd-frank act prohibition on "proprietary trading" and the limitation on the sponsorship of, and investment in, "covered funds" (as defined in the volcker rule). in addition, there is increased regulation of, and restrictions on, otc derivatives markets and transactions, particularly related to swaps and security-based swaps.
the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis see "business Â— regulation" in part i, item 1 of this form 10-k for more information about the laws, rules and regulations and proposed laws, rules and regulations that apply to us and our operations. in addition, see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for information about regulatory developments as they relate to our regulatory capital and leverage ratios.
volcker rule the provisions of the dodd-frank act referred to as the "volcker rule" became effective in july 2015 (subject to a conformance period, as applicable). the volcker rule prohibits "proprietary trading," but permits activities such as underwriting, market making and risk-mitigation hedging, requires an extensive compliance program and includes additional reporting and record-keeping requirements. the initial implementation of these rules did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. however, the rule is highly complex, and its impact may change as market practices further develop.
in addition to the prohibition on proprietary trading, the volcker rule limits the sponsorship of, and investment in, covered funds by banking entities, including group inc. and its subsidiaries. it also limits certain types of transactions between us and our sponsored funds, similar to the limitations on transactions between depository institutions and their affiliates as described in "business Â— regulation" in part i, item 1 of this form 10-k. covered funds include our private equity funds, certain of our credit and real estate funds, our hedge funds and certain other investment structures. the limitation on investments in covered funds requires us to reduce our investment in each such fund to 3% or less of the fund's net asset value, and to reduce our aggregate investment in all such funds to 3% or less of our tier 1 capital.
our investments in applicable covered funds purchased after december 2013 are required to be deducted from tier 1 capital. see "equity capital management and regulatory capital Â— fully phased-in capital ratios" for further information about our tier 1 capital and the deduction for investments in covered funds.
we continue to manage our existing interests in such funds, taking into account the conformance period under the volcker rule. we plan to continue to conduct our investing and lending activities in ways that are permissible under the volcker rule.
our current investment in funds at nav is $6.47 billion. in order to be compliant with the volcker rule, we will be required to reduce most of our interests in these funds by the end of the conformance period. see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our investment in funds at nav and the conformance period for covered funds.
although our net revenues from our interests in private equity, credit, real estate and hedge funds may vary from period to period, our aggregate net revenues from these investments were approximately 3% and 5% of our aggregate total net revenues over the last 10 years and 5 years, respectively.
total loss-absorbing capacity in december 2016, the federal reserve board adopted a final rule, which establishes new total loss-absorbing capacity (tlac) and related requirements for u.s. bank holding companies designated as g-sibs. the rule will be effective in january 2019, with no phase-in period, and has been designed so that, in the event of a g-sib's failure, there will be sufficient external loss-absorbing capacity available in order for authorities to implement an orderly resolution of the g-sib. the rule (i) establishes minimum tlac requirements, (ii) establishes minimum eligible long-term debt requirements, (iii) prohibits certain holding company transactions and (iv) caps the amount of g-sib liabilities that are not eligible long-term debt.
we expect that we will be compliant with the tlac requirements by the effective date. see "business Â— regulation" in part i, item 1 of this form 10-k for further information about the federal reserve board's tlac rule.
78   goldman sachs 2016 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis other regulatory developments in september 2016, the final margin rules issued by the u.s. federal bank regulatory agencies and the cftc for uncleared swaps became effective. these rules will phase in through march 2017 for variation margin requirements and through september 2020 for initial margin requirements depending on the level of swaps, security-based swaps and/or exempt foreign exchange derivative transaction activity of the swap dealer and the relevant counterparty. the final rules of the u.s. federal bank regulatory agencies generally apply to inter-affiliate transactions, with limited relief available from initial margin requirements for affiliates.
under the cftc final rules, inter-affiliate transactions are exempt from initial margin requirements with certain exceptions but variation margin requirements still apply. we expect that our margin requirements will continue to increase as the rules phase in. japanese regulators have implemented broadly similar rules and regulators in other major jurisdictions are expected to do so over the next several quarters.
see "business Â— regulation" in part i, item 1 of this form 10-k for further information about regulations that may impact us in the future.
off-balance-sheet arrangements and contractual obligations off-balance-sheet arrangements we have various types of off-balance-sheet arrangements that we enter into in the ordinary course of business. our involvement in these arrangements can take many different forms, including:
Â•   purchasing or retaining residual and other interests in special purpose entities such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securitization vehicles;
Â•   holding senior and subordinated debt, interests in limited and general partnerships, and preferred and common stock in other nonconsolidated vehicles;
Â•   entering into interest rate, foreign currency, equity, commodity and credit derivatives, including total return swaps;
Â•   entering into operating leases; and
Â•   providing guarantees, indemnifications, commitments, letters of credit and representations and warranties.
we enter into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes, including securitizations. the securitization vehicles that purchase mortgages, corporate bonds, and other types of financial assets are critical to the functioning of several significant investor markets, including the mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities markets, since they offer investors access to specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization process.
we also enter into these arrangements to underwrite client securitization transactions; provide secondary market liquidity; make investments in performing and nonperforming debt, equity, real estate and other assets; provide investors with credit-linked and asset-repackaged notes; and receive or provide letters of credit to satisfy margin requirements and to facilitate the clearance and settlement process.
our financial interests in, and derivative transactions with, such nonconsolidated entities are generally accounted for at fair value, in the same manner as our other financial instruments, except in cases where we apply the equity method of accounting.

Â•       obligations maturing within one year of our financial statement date or redeemable within one year of our financial statement date at the option of the holders are excluded as they are treated as short-term obligations.
Â•                             obligations that are repayable prior to maturity at our option are reflected at their contractual maturity dates and obligations that are redeemable prior to maturity at the option of the holders are reflected at the earliest dates such options become exercisable.
Â•                          amounts included in the table do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash flow requirements for these arrangements because commitments and guarantees represent notional amounts and may expire unused or be reduced or cancelled at the counterparty's request.
Â•                     due to the uncertainty of the timing and amounts that will ultimately be paid, our liability for unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded. see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our unrecognized tax benefits.
Â•         as of december 2016, unsecured long-term borrowings includes $7.43 billion of adjustments to the carrying value of certain unsecured long-term borrowings resulting from the application of hedge accounting.
Â•                               as of december 2016, the aggregate contractual principal amount of secured long-term financings and unsecured long-term borrowings for which the fair value option was elected exceeded the related fair value by $361 million and $1.56 billion, respectively.
Â•                                    contractual interest payments represents estimated future interest payments related to unsecured long-term borrowings, secured long-term financings and time deposits based on applicable interest rates as of december 2016, and includes stated coupons, if any, on structured notes.
see notes 15 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our short-term borrowings, and commitments and guarantees, respectively.
as of december 2016, our unsecured long-term borrowings were $189.09 billion, with maturities extending to 2056, and consisted principally of senior borrowings. see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our unsecured long-term borrowings.
as of december 2016, our future minimum rental payments, net of minimum sublease rentals under noncancelable leases, were $1.94 billion. these lease commitments for office space expire on various dates through 2069. certain agreements are subject to periodic escalation provisions for increases in real estate taxes and other charges. see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our leases.
our occupancy expenses include costs associated with office space held in excess of our current requirements. this excess space, the cost of which is charged to earnings as incurred, is being held for potential growth or to replace currently occupied space that we may exit in the future. we regularly evaluate our current and future space capacity in relation to current and projected staffing levels. for 2016, we incurred exit costs of approximately $68 million related to office space held in excess of our current requirements. additional occupancy expenses for excess office space were not material for 2016. we may incur exit costs in the future to the extent we (i) reduce our space capacity or (ii) commit to, or occupy, new properties in the locations in which we operate and, consequently, dispose of existing space that had been held for potential growth. these exit costs may be material to our results of operations in a given period.
risk management risks are inherent in our business and include liquidity, market, credit, operational, model, legal, regulatory and reputational risks. for further information about our risk management processes, see "Â— overview and structure of risk management" below. our risks include the risks across our risk categories, regions or global businesses, as well as those which have uncertain outcomes and have the potential to materially impact our financial results, our liquidity and our reputation. for further information about our areas of risk, see "Â— liquidity risk management," "Â— market risk management," "Â— credit risk management," "Â— operational risk management" and "Â— model risk management" below and "risk factors" in part i, item 1a of this form 10-k.
the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis overview and structure of risk management overview we believe that effective risk management is of primary importance to our success. accordingly, we have comprehensive risk management processes through which we monitor, evaluate and manage the risks we assume in conducting our activities. these include liquidity, market, credit, operational, model, legal, compliance, regulatory and reputational risk exposures. our risk management framework is built around three core components: governance, processes and people.
governance. risk management governance starts with our board, which plays an important role in reviewing and approving risk management policies and practices, both directly and through its committees, including its risk committee. the board also receives regular briefings on firmwide risks, including market risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, operational risk and model risk from our independent control and support functions, including the chief risk officer, and on compliance risk from the head of compliance, on legal and regulatory matters from the general counsel, and on other matters impacting our reputation from the chair of our firmwide client and business standards committee. the chief risk officer, as part of the review of the firmwide risk portfolio, regularly advises the risk committee of the board of relevant risk metrics and material exposures. next, at our most senior levels, our leaders are experienced risk managers, with a sophisticated and detailed understanding of the risks we take. our senior management, and senior managers in our revenue-producing units and independent control and support functions, lead and participate in risk-oriented committees. independent control and support functions include compliance, the conflicts resolution group (conflicts), controllers, credit risk management and advisory (credit risk management), human capital management, legal, liquidity risk management and analysis (liquidity risk management), market risk management and analysis (market risk management), model risk management, operations, operational risk management and analysis (operational risk management), tax, technology and treasury.
our governance structure provides the protocol and responsibility for decision-making on risk management issues and ensures implementation of those decisions. we make extensive use of risk-related committees that meet regularly and serve as an important means to facilitate and foster ongoing discussions to identify, manage and mitigate risks.
we maintain strong communication about risk and we have a culture of collaboration in decision-making among the revenue-producing units, independent control and support functions, committees and senior management. while we believe that the first line of defense in managing risk rests with the managers in our revenue-producing units, we dedicate extensive resources to independent control and support functions in order to ensure a strong oversight structure and an appropriate segregation of duties. we regularly reinforce our strong culture of escalation and accountability across all divisions and functions.
processes. we maintain various processes and procedures that are critical components of our risk management. first and foremost is our daily discipline of marking substantially all of our inventory to current market levels. we carry our inventory at fair value, with changes in valuation reflected immediately in our risk management systems and in net revenues. we do so because we believe this discipline is one of the most effective tools for assessing and managing risk and that it provides transparent and realistic insight into our financial exposures.
we also apply a rigorous framework of limits to control risk across transactions, products, businesses and markets. this includes approval of limits at firmwide, business and product levels by the risk committee of the board. in addition, the firmwide risk committee is responsible for approving our risk limits framework, subject to the overall limits approved by the risk committee of the board, at a variety of levels and monitoring these limits on a daily basis. the risk governance committee (through delegated authority from the firmwide risk committee) is responsible for approving limits at firmwide, business and product levels. certain limits may be set at levels that will require periodic adjustment, rather than at levels which reflect our maximum risk appetite. this fosters an ongoing dialogue on risk among revenue-producing units, independent control and support functions, committees and senior management, as well as rapid escalation of risk-related matters. see "liquidity risk management," "market risk management" and "credit risk management" for further information about our risk limits.
82   goldman sachs 2016 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis active management of our positions is another important process. proactive mitigation of our market and credit exposures minimizes the risk that we will be required to take outsized actions during periods of stress.
we also focus on the rigor and effectiveness of our risk systems. the goal of our risk management technology is to get the right information to the right people at the right time, which requires systems that are comprehensive, reliable and timely. we devote significant time and resources to our risk management technology to ensure that it consistently provides us with complete, accurate and timely information.
people. even the best technology serves only as a tool for helping to make informed decisions in real time about the risks we are taking. ultimately, effective risk management requires our people to interpret our risk data on an ongoing and timely basis and adjust risk positions accordingly. in both our revenue-producing units and our independent control and support functions, the experience of our professionals, and their understanding of the nuances and limitations of each risk measure, guide us in assessing exposures and maintaining them within prudent levels.
we reinforce a culture of effective risk management in our training and development programs as well as the way we evaluate performance, and recognize and reward our people. our training and development programs, including certain sessions led by our most senior leaders, are focused on the importance of risk management, client relationships and reputational excellence. as part of our annual performance review process, we assess reputational excellence including how an employee exercises good risk management and reputational judgment, and adheres to our code of conduct and compliance policies. our review and reward processes are designed to communicate and reinforce to our professionals the link between behavior and how people are recognized, the need to focus on our clients and our reputation, and the need to always act in accordance with the highest standards of the firm.
structure ultimate oversight of risk is the responsibility of our board. the board oversees risk both directly and through its committees, including its risk committee. within the firm, a series of committees with specific risk management mandates have oversight or decision-making responsibilities for risk management activities. committee membership generally consists of senior managers from both our revenue-producing units and our independent control and support functions. we have established procedures for these committees to ensure that appropriate information barriers are in place. our primary risk committees, most of which also have additional sub-committees or working groups, are described below. in addition to these committees, we have other risk-oriented committees which provide oversight for different businesses, activities, products, regions and legal entities. all of our firmwide, regional and divisional committees have responsibility for considering the impact of transactions and activities which they oversee on our reputation.
membership of our risk committees is reviewed regularly and updated to reflect changes in the responsibilities of the committee members. accordingly, the length of time that members serve on the respective committees varies as determined by the committee chairs and based on the responsibilities of the members.
in addition, independent control and support functions, which report to the chief executive officer, the presidents and co-chief operating officers, the chief financial officer or the chief risk officer, are responsible for day-to-day oversight or monitoring of risk, as illustrated in the chart below and as described in greater detail in the following sections. internal audit, which reports to the audit committee of the board and includes professionals with a broad range of audit and industry experience, including risk management expertise, is responsible for independently assessing and validating key controls within the risk management framework.
the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis the chart below presents an overview of our risk management governance structure, including the reporting relationships of our independent control and support functions.
management committee. the management committee oversees our global activities, including all of our independent control and support functions. it provides this oversight directly and through authority delegated to committees it has established. this committee is comprised of our most senior leaders, and is chaired by our chief executive officer. most members of the management committee are also members of other firmwide, divisional and regional committees. the following are the committees that are principally involved in firmwide risk management.

conflicts management conflicts of interest and our approach to dealing with them are fundamental to our client relationships, our reputation and our long-term success. the term "conflict of interest" does not have a universally accepted meaning, and conflicts can arise in many forms within a business or between businesses. the responsibility for identifying potential conflicts, as well as complying with our policies and procedures, is shared by the entire firm.
we have a multilayered approach to resolving conflicts and addressing reputational risk. our senior management oversees policies related to conflicts resolution, and, in conjunction with conflicts, legal and compliance, the firmwide client and business standards committee, and other internal committees, formulates policies, standards and principles, and assists in making judgments regarding the appropriate resolution of particular conflicts. resolving potential conflicts necessarily depends on the facts and circumstances of a particular situation and the application of experienced and informed judgment.
as a general matter, conflicts reviews financing and advisory assignments in investment banking and certain investing, lending and other activities of the firm. in addition, we have various transaction oversight committees, such as the firmwide capital, commitments and suitability committees and other committees that also review new underwritings, loans, investments and structured products. these groups and committees work with internal and external counsel and compliance to evaluate and address any actual or potential conflicts. conflicts reports to one of our presidents and co-chief operating officers.
we regularly assess our policies and procedures that address conflicts of interest in an effort to conduct our business in accordance with the highest ethical standards and in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations.
86   goldman sachs 2016 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis liquidity risk management overview liquidity risk is the risk that we will be unable to fund the firm or meet our liquidity needs in the event of firm-specific, broader industry, or market liquidity stress events. liquidity is of critical importance to us, as most of the failures of financial institutions have occurred in large part due to insufficient liquidity. accordingly, we have in place a comprehensive and conservative set of liquidity and funding policies. our principal objective is to be able to fund the firm and to enable our core businesses to continue to serve clients and generate revenues, even under adverse circumstances.
treasury has the primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our liquidity and funding strategy. treasury is independent of the revenue-producing units and reports to our chief financial officer.
liquidity risk management is an independent risk management function responsible for control and oversight of our liquidity risk management framework, including stress testing and limit governance. liquidity risk management is independent of the revenue-producing units and treasury, and reports to our chief risk officer.
liquidity risk management principles we manage liquidity risk according to three principles (i) hold sufficient excess liquidity in the form of global core liquid assets (gcla) to cover outflows during a stressed period, (ii) maintain appropriate asset-liability management and (iii) maintain a viable contingency funding plan.
global core liquid assets. gcla is liquidity that we maintain to meet a broad range of potential cash outflows and collateral needs in a stressed environment. our most important liquidity policy is to pre-fund our estimated potential cash and collateral needs during a liquidity crisis and hold this liquidity in the form of unencumbered, highly liquid securities and cash. we believe that the securities held in our gcla would be readily convertible to cash in a matter of days, through liquidation, by entering into repurchase agreements or from maturities of resale agreements, and that this cash would allow us to meet immediate obligations without needing to sell other assets or depend on additional funding from credit-sensitive markets.
our gcla reflects the following principles:
Â•   the first days or weeks of a liquidity crisis are the most critical to a company's survival;
Â•                                                                      focus must be maintained on all potential cash and collateral outflows, not just disruptions to financing flows. our businesses are diverse, and our liquidity needs are determined by many factors, including market movements, collateral requirements and client commitments, all of which can change dramatically in a difficult funding environment;
Â•                                         during a liquidity crisis, credit-sensitive funding, including unsecured debt and some types of secured financing agreements, may be unavailable, and the terms (e.g., interest rates, collateral provisions and tenor) or availability of other types of secured financing may change; and
Â•                                                                          as a result of our policy to pre-fund liquidity that we estimate may be needed in a crisis, we hold more unencumbered securities and have larger debt balances than our businesses would otherwise require. we believe that our liquidity is stronger with greater balances of highly liquid unencumbered securities, even though it increases our total assets and our funding costs.
we maintain our gcla across major broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries, asset types, and clearing agents to provide us with sufficient operating liquidity to ensure timely settlement in all major markets, even in a difficult funding environment. in addition to the gcla, we maintain cash balances in several of our other entities, primarily for use in specific currencies, entities, or jurisdictions where we do not have immediate access to parent company liquidity.
we believe that our gcla provides us with a resilient source of funds that would be available in advance of potential cash and collateral outflows and gives us significant flexibility in managing through a difficult funding environment.
asset-liability management. our liquidity risk management policies are designed to ensure we have a sufficient amount of financing, even when funding markets experience persistent stress. we manage the maturities and diversity of our funding across markets, products and counterparties, and seek to maintain a long-dated and diversified funding profile, taking into consideration the characteristics and liquidity profile of our assets.
the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis our approach to asset-liability management includes:
Â•                                  conservatively managing the overall characteristics of our funding book, with a focus on maintaining long-term, diversified sources of funding in excess of our current requirements. see "balance sheet and funding sources Â— funding sources" for additional details;
Â•                                                                          actively managing and monitoring our asset base, with particular focus on the liquidity, holding period and our ability to fund assets on a secured basis. we assess our funding requirements and our ability to liquidate assets in a stressed environment while appropriately managing risk. this enables us to determine the most appropriate funding products and tenors. see "balance sheet and funding sources Â— balance sheet management" for more detail on our balance sheet management process and "Â— funding sources Â— secured funding" for more detail on asset classes that may be harder to fund on a secured basis; and
Â•                                                                       raising secured and unsecured financing that has a long tenor relative to the liquidity profile of our assets.
this reduces the risk that our liabilities will come due in advance of our ability to generate liquidity from the sale of our assets. because we maintain a highly liquid balance sheet, the holding period of certain of our assets may be materially shorter than their contractual maturity dates.
our goal is to ensure that we maintain sufficient liquidity to fund our assets and meet our contractual and contingent obligations in normal times as well as during periods of market stress. through our dynamic balance sheet management process, we use actual and projected asset balances to determine secured and unsecured funding requirements. funding plans are reviewed and approved by the firmwide finance committee on a quarterly basis. in addition, senior managers in our independent control and support functions regularly analyze, and the firmwide finance committee reviews, our consolidated total capital position (unsecured long-term borrowings plus total shareholders' equity) so that we maintain a level of long-term funding that is sufficient to meet our long-term financing requirements. in a liquidity crisis, we would first use our gcla in order to avoid reliance on asset sales (other than our gcla). however, we recognize that orderly asset sales may be prudent or necessary in a severe or persistent liquidity crisis.
subsidiary funding policies the majority of our unsecured funding is raised by group inc. which lends the necessary funds to its subsidiaries, some of which are regulated, to meet their asset financing, liquidity and capital requirements. in addition, group inc. provides its regulated subsidiaries with the necessary capital to meet their regulatory requirements. the benefits of this approach to subsidiary funding are enhanced control and greater flexibility to meet the funding requirements of our subsidiaries. funding is also raised at the subsidiary level through a variety of products, including secured funding, unsecured borrowings and deposits.
our intercompany funding policies assume that, unless legally provided for, a subsidiary's funds or securities are not freely available to its parent or other subsidiaries. in particular, many of our subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to group inc. regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that group inc. needs to make payments on its obligations. accordingly, we assume that the capital provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to group inc. or other subsidiaries and any other financing provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available until the maturity of such financing.
group inc. has provided substantial amounts of equity and subordinated indebtedness, directly or indirectly, to its regulated subsidiaries. for example, as of december 2016, group inc. had $30.09 billion of equity and subordinated indebtedness invested in gs&co., its principal u.s. registered broker-dealer; $36.94 billion invested in gsi, a regulated u.k. broker-dealer; $2.62 billion invested in goldman sachs japan co., ltd. (gsjcl), a regulated japanese broker-dealer; $26.61 billion invested in gs bank usa, a regulated new york state-chartered bank; and $3.77 billion invested in gsib, a regulated u.k. bank. group inc. also provided, directly or indirectly, $97.77 billion of unsubordinated loans (including secured loans of $49.90 billion), and $19.60 billion of collateral and cash deposits to these entities, substantially all of which was to gs&co., gsi, gsjcl and gs bank usa, as of december 2016. in addition, as of december 2016, group inc. had significant amounts of capital invested in and loans to its other regulated subsidiaries.
88   goldman sachs 2016 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis contingency funding plan. we maintain a contingency funding plan to provide a framework for analyzing and responding to a liquidity crisis situation or periods of market stress. our contingency funding plan outlines a list of potential risk factors, key reports and metrics that are reviewed on an ongoing basis to assist in assessing the severity of, and managing through, a liquidity crisis and/or market dislocation. the contingency funding plan also describes in detail our potential responses if our assessments indicate that we have entered a liquidity crisis, which include pre-funding for what we estimate will be our potential cash and collateral needs as well as utilizing secondary sources of liquidity. mitigants and action items to address specific risks which may arise are also described and assigned to individuals responsible for execution.
the contingency funding plan identifies key groups of individuals to foster effective coordination, control and distribution of information, all of which are critical in the management of a crisis or period of market stress. the contingency funding plan also details the responsibilities of these groups and individuals, which include making and disseminating key decisions, coordinating all contingency activities throughout the duration of the crisis or period of market stress, implementing liquidity maintenance activities and managing internal and external communication.
liquidity stress tests in order to determine the appropriate size of our gcla, we use an internal liquidity model, referred to as the modeled liquidity outflow, which captures and quantifies our liquidity risks. we also consider other factors including, but not limited to, an assessment of our potential intraday liquidity needs through an additional internal liquidity model, referred to as the intraday liquidity model, the results of our long-term stress testing models, applicable regulatory requirements and a qualitative assessment of the condition of the financial markets and the firm. the results of the modeled liquidity outflow, the intraday liquidity model and the long-term stress testing models are reported to senior management on a regular basis.
modeled liquidity outflow. our modeled liquidity outflow is based on conducting multiple scenarios that include combinations of market-wide and firm-specific stress. these scenarios are characterized by the following qualitative elements:
Â•                     severely challenged market environments, including low consumer and corporate confidence, financial and political instability, adverse changes in market values, including potential declines in equity markets and widening of credit spreads; and
Â•   a firm-specific crisis potentially triggered by material losses, reputational damage, litigation, executive departure, and/or a ratings downgrade.
the following are the critical modeling parameters of the modeled liquidity outflow:
Â•   liquidity needs over a 30-day scenario;
Â•   a two-notch downgrade of our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings;
Â•                                        a combination of contractual outflows, such as upcoming maturities of unsecured debt, and contingent outflows
(e.g., actions though not contractually required, we may deem necessary in a crisis). we assume that most contingent outflows will occur within the initial days and weeks of a crisis;
Â•   no issuance of equity or unsecured debt;
Â•   no support from additional government funding facilities. although we have access to various central bank funding programs, we do not assume reliance on additional sources of funding in a liquidity crisis; and
Â•   no asset liquidation, other than the gcla.
the potential contractual and contingent cash and collateral outflows covered in our modeled liquidity outflow include:
unsecured funding
Â•      contractual: all upcoming maturities of unsecured long-term debt, commercial paper, and other unsecured funding products. we assume that we will be unable to issue new unsecured debt or rollover any maturing debt.
Â•   contingent: repurchases of our outstanding long-term debt, commercial paper and hybrid financial instruments in the ordinary course of business as a market maker.
deposits
Â•   contractual: all upcoming maturities of term deposits. we assume that we will be unable to raise new term deposits or rollover any maturing term deposits.
Â•                  contingent: partial withdrawals of deposits that have no contractual maturity. the withdrawal assumptions reflect, among other factors, the type of deposit, whether the deposit is insured or uninsured, and our relationship with the depositor.
the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis secured funding
Â•                                                                        contractual: a portion of upcoming contractual maturities of secured funding due to either the inability to refinance or the ability to refinance only at wider haircuts (i.e., on terms which require us to post additional collateral). our assumptions reflect, among other factors, the quality of the underlying collateral, counterparty roll probabilities
(our assessment of the counterparty's likelihood of continuing to provide funding on a secured basis at the maturity of the trade) and counterparty concentration.
Â•   contingent: adverse changes in the value of financial assets pledged as collateral for financing transactions, which would necessitate additional collateral postings under those transactions.
otc derivatives
Â•   contingent: collateral postings to counterparties due to adverse changes in the value of our otc derivatives, excluding those that are cleared and settled through central counterparties (otc-cleared).
Â•                                                                      contingent: other outflows of cash or collateral related to otc derivatives, excluding otc-cleared, including the impact of trade terminations, collateral substitutions, collateral disputes, loss of rehypothecation rights, collateral calls or termination payments required by a two-notch downgrade in our credit ratings, and collateral that has not been called by counterparties, but is available to them.
exchange-traded and otc-cleared derivatives
Â•   contingent: variation margin postings required due to adverse changes in the value of our outstanding exchange-traded and otc-cleared derivatives.
Â•   contingent: an increase in initial margin and guaranty fund requirements by derivative clearing houses.
customer cash and securities
Â•       contingent: liquidity outflows associated with our prime brokerage business, including withdrawals of customer credit balances, and a reduction in customer short positions, which may serve as a funding source for long positions.
firm securities
Â•   contingent: liquidity outflows associated with a reduction or composition change in firm short positions, which may serve as a funding source for long positions.
unfunded commitments
Â•   contingent: draws on our unfunded commitments. draw assumptions reflect, among other things, the type of commitment and counterparty.
other
Â•   other upcoming large cash outflows, such as tax payments.
intraday liquidity model. our intraday liquidity model measures our intraday liquidity needs using a scenario analysis characterized by the same qualitative elements as our modeled liquidity outflow. the model assesses the risk of increased intraday liquidity requirements during a scenario where access to sources of intraday liquidity may become constrained.
the following are key modeling elements of the intraday liquidity model:
Â•   liquidity needs over a one-day settlement period;
Â•   delays in receipt of counterparty cash payments;
Â•   a reduction in the availability of intraday credit lines at our third-party clearing agents; and
Â•   higher settlement volumes due to an increase in activity.
long-term stress testing. we utilize a longer-term stress test to take a forward view on our liquidity position through a prolonged stress period in which we experience a severe liquidity stress and recover in an environment that continues to be challenging. we are focused on ensuring conservative asset-liability management to prepare for a prolonged period of potential stress, seeking to maintain a long-dated and diversified funding profile, taking into consideration the characteristics and liquidity profile of our assets.
we also perform stress tests on a regular basis as part of our routine risk management processes and conduct tailored stress tests on an ad hoc or product-specific basis in response to market developments.
model review and validation treasury regularly refines our modeled liquidity outflow, intraday liquidity model and our other stress testing models to reflect changes in market or economic conditions and our business mix. any changes, including model assumptions, are assessed and approved by liquidity risk management.
model risk management is responsible for the independent review and validation of our liquidity models. see "model risk management" for further information about the review and validation of these models.
90   goldman sachs 2016 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis limits we use liquidity limits at various levels and across liquidity risk types to manage the size of our liquidity exposures. limits are measured relative to acceptable levels of risk given our liquidity risk tolerance. the purpose of the firmwide limits is to assist senior management in monitoring and controlling our overall liquidity profile.
the risk committee of the board and the firmwide finance committee approve liquidity risk limits at the firmwide level. limits are reviewed frequently and amended, with required approvals, on a permanent and temporary basis, as appropriate, to reflect changing market or business conditions.
our liquidity risk limits are monitored by treasury and liquidity risk management. treasury is responsible for identifying and escalating, on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded.
gcla and unencumbered metrics gcla. based on the results of our internal liquidity risk models, described above, as well as our consideration of other factors including, but not limited to, an assessment of our potential intraday liquidity needs and a qualitative assessment of the condition of the financial markets and the firm, we believe our liquidity position as of both december 2016 and december 2015 was appropriate. as of december 2016 and december 2015, the fair value of the securities and certain overnight cash deposits included in our gcla totaled $226.07 billion and $199.12 billion, respectively. the increase in our gcla from december 2015 to december 2016 is primarily a result of the acquisition of ge capital bank's online deposit platform in april 2016. see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about this acquisition. the fair value of our gcla averaged $211.10 billion and $187.75 billion for the years ended december 2016 and december 2015, respectively.
the table below presents the average fair value of the securities and certain overnight cash deposits that are included in our gcla.

we maintain our gcla to enable us to meet current and potential liquidity requirements of our parent company, group inc., and its subsidiaries. our modeled liquidity outflow and intraday liquidity model incorporate a consolidated requirement for group inc. as well as a standalone requirement for each of our major broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries. liquidity held directly in each of these major subsidiaries is intended for use only by that subsidiary to meet its liquidity requirements and is assumed not to be available to group inc. unless (i) legally provided for and (ii) there are no additional regulatory, tax or other restrictions. in addition, the modeled liquidity outflow and intraday liquidity model also incorporate a broader assessment of standalone liquidity requirements for other subsidiaries and we hold a portion of our gcla directly at group inc. to support such requirements.

the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis other unencumbered assets. in addition to our gcla, we have a significant amount of other unencumbered cash and financial instruments, including other government obligations, high-grade money market securities, corporate obligations, marginable equities, loans and cash deposits not included in our gcla. beginning in january 2016, to be consistent with changes in the manner in which management views unencumbered assets, we included certain loans within our unencumbered assets. the fair value of our unencumbered assets averaged $142.33 billion and $90.36 billion for the years ended december 2016 and december 2015, respectively. had these loans been included as of december 2015, the fair value of our unencumbered assets would have increased by $44.45 billion. we do not consider these assets liquid enough to be eligible for our gcla.
liquidity regulatory framework the final rules on minimum liquidity standards approved by the u.s. federal bank regulatory agencies call for a liquidity coverage ratio (lcr) designed to ensure that banking organizations maintain an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets (hqla) based on expected net cash outflows under an acute short-term liquidity stress scenario. our gcla is substantially the same in composition as the assets that qualify as hqla under these rules.
the lcr became effective in the u.s. on january 1, 2015, with a phase-in period whereby firms had an 80% minimum in 2015, which increased by 10% per year until 2017. in december 2016, the federal reserve board issued a final rule that requires bank holding companies to disclose, on a quarterly basis beginning with the second quarter of 2017, lcr averages over the quarter, quantitative and qualitative information on certain components of the lcr calculation and projected net cash outflows. for the three months ended december 2016, our average lcr exceeded the fully phased-in minimum requirement, based on our interpretation and understanding of the finalized framework, which may evolve as we review our interpretation and application with our regulators.
in addition, in the second quarter of 2016, the u.s. federal bank regulatory agencies issued a proposed rule that calls for a net stable funding ratio (nsfr) for large u.s. banking organizations. the proposal would require banking organizations to ensure they have access to stable funding over a one-year time horizon. the proposed nsfr requirement has an effective date of january 1, 2018, including quarterly disclosure of the ratio, as well as a description of the banking organization's stable funding sources. based on our interpretation of the current proposal, we estimate that as of december 2016, our nsfr was slightly lower than the proposed requirement; however, we expect that we will be compliant with the requirement by the effective date.

Â•                                                                                             other subsidiaries. we monitor the local regulatory liquidity requirements of our subsidiaries to ensure compliance. for many of our subsidiaries, these requirements either have changed or are likely to change in the future due to the implementation of the basel committee's framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring, as well as other regulatory developments.
the implementation of these rules, and any amendments adopted by the applicable regulatory authorities, could impact our liquidity and funding requirements and practices in the future.

we believe our credit ratings are primarily based on the credit rating agencies' assessment of:
Â•   our liquidity, market, credit and operational risk management practices;
Â•   the level and variability of our earnings;
Â•   our capital base;
Â•   our franchise, reputation and management;
Â•   our corporate governance; and
Â•   the external operating and economic environment, including, in some cases, the assumed level of government support or other systemic considerations, such as potential resolution.
certain of our derivatives have been transacted under bilateral agreements with counterparties who may require us to post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in our credit ratings. we assess the impact of these bilateral agreements by determining the collateral or termination payments that would occur assuming a downgrade by all rating agencies. a downgrade by any one rating agency, depending on the agency's relative ratings of us at the time of the downgrade, may have an impact which is comparable to the impact of a downgrade by all rating agencies. we manage our gcla to ensure we would, among other potential requirements, be able to make the additional collateral or termination payments that may be required in the event of a two-notch reduction in our long-term credit ratings, as well as collateral that has not been called by counterparties, but is available to them.
the table below presents the additional collateral or termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities under bilateral agreements that could have been called at the reporting date by counterparties in the event of a one-notch and two-notch downgrade in our credit ratings.

the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis cash flows as a global financial institution, our cash flows are complex and bear little relation to our net earnings and net assets. consequently, we believe that traditional cash flow analysis is less meaningful in evaluating our liquidity position than the liquidity and asset-liability management policies described above. cash flow analysis may, however, be helpful in highlighting certain macro trends and strategic initiatives in our businesses.
year ended december 2016. our cash and cash equivalents increased by $28.27 billion to $121.71 billion at the end of 2016. we generated $9.27 billion in net cash from investing activities, primarily from net cash acquired in business acquisitions. we generated $19.00 billion in net cash from financing activities and operating activities, primarily from increases in deposits and from net issuances of unsecured long-term borrowings, partially offset by repurchases of common stock.
year ended december 2015. our cash and cash equivalents increased by $18.41 billion to $93.44 billion at the end of 2015. we used $18.57 billion in net cash for investing activities, primarily due to funding of loans receivable. we generated $36.99 billion in net cash from financing activities and operating activities primarily from net issuances of long-term borrowings and bank deposits, partially offset by repurchases of common stock.
year ended december 2014. our cash and cash equivalents decreased by $3.84 billion to $75.03 billion at the end of 2014. we used $22.84 billion in net cash for operating and investing activities, which reflects an initiative to reduce our balance sheet, and the funding of loans receivable. we generated $19.00 billion in net cash from financing activities from an increase in bank deposits and net proceeds from issuances of unsecured long-term borrowings, partially offset by repurchases of common stock.
market risk management overview market risk is the risk of loss in the value of our inventory, as well as certain other financial assets and financial liabilities, due to changes in market conditions. we employ a variety of risk measures, each described in the respective sections below, to monitor market risk. we hold inventory primarily for market making for our clients and for our investing and lending activities. our inventory therefore changes based on client demands and our investment opportunities. our inventory is accounted for at fair value and therefore fluctuates on a daily basis, with the related gains and losses included in "market making" and "other principal transactions." categories of market risk include the following:
Â•   interest rate risk: results from exposures to changes in the level, slope and curvature of yield curves, the volatilities of interest rates, mortgage prepayment speeds and credit spreads;
Â•   equity price risk: results from exposures to changes in prices and volatilities of individual equities, baskets of equities and equity indices;
Â•   currency rate risk: results from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices and volatilities of currency rates; and
Â•    commodity price risk: results from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices and volatilities of commodities, such as crude oil, petroleum products, natural gas, electricity, and precious and base metals.
market risk management, which is independent of the revenue-producing units and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our market risk. we monitor and control risks through strong firmwide oversight and independent control and support functions across our global businesses.
managers in revenue-producing units and market risk management discuss market information, positions and estimated risk and loss scenarios on an ongoing basis. managers in revenue-producing units are accountable for managing risk within prescribed limits. these managers have in-depth knowledge of their positions, markets and the instruments available to hedge their exposures.
94   goldman sachs 2016 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis market risk management process we manage our market risk by diversifying exposures, controlling position sizes and establishing economic hedges in related securities or derivatives. this process includes:
Â•   accurate and timely exposure information incorporating multiple risk metrics;
Â•   a dynamic limit setting framework; and
Â•   constant communication among revenue-producing units, risk managers and senior management.
risk measures market risk management produces risk measures and monitors them against established market risk limits. these measures reflect an extensive range of scenarios and the results are aggregated at product, business and firmwide levels.
we use a variety of risk measures to estimate the size of potential losses for both moderate and more extreme market moves over both short-term and long-term time horizons. our primary risk measures are var, which is used for shorter-term periods, and stress tests. our risk reports detail key risks, drivers and changes for each desk and business, and are distributed daily to senior management of both our revenue-producing units and our independent control and support functions.
value-at-risk. var is the potential loss in value due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level. for assets and liabilities included in var, see "financial statement linkages to market risk measures." we typically employ a one-day time horizon with a 95% confidence level. we use a single var model which captures risks including interest rates, equity prices, currency rates and commodity prices. as such, var facilitates comparison across portfolios of different risk characteristics. var also captures the diversification of aggregated risk at the firmwide level.
we are aware of the inherent limitations to var and therefore use a variety of risk measures in our market risk management process. inherent limitations to var include:
Â•   var does not estimate potential losses over longer time horizons where moves may be extreme;
Â•   var does not take account of the relative liquidity of different risk positions; and
Â•   previous moves in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of all future market moves.
when calculating var, we use historical simulations with full valuation of approximately 70,000 market factors. var is calculated at a position level based on simultaneously shocking the relevant market risk factors for that position. we sample from five years of historical data to generate the scenarios for our var calculation. the historical data is weighted so that the relative importance of the data reduces over time. this gives greater importance to more recent observations and reflects current asset volatilities, which improves the accuracy of our estimates of potential loss. as a result, even if our positions included in var were unchanged, our var would increase with increasing market volatility and vice versa.
given its reliance on historical data, var is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions.
our var measure does not include:
Â•   positions that are best measured and monitored using sensitivity measures; and
Â•   the impact of changes in counterparty and our own credit spreads on derivatives, as well as changes in our own credit spreads on unsecured borrowings for which the fair value option was elected.
we perform daily backtesting of our var model (i.e., comparing daily trading net revenues to the var measure calculated as of the prior business day) at the firmwide level and for each of our businesses and major regulated subsidiaries.
stress testing. stress testing is a method of determining the effect of various hypothetical stress scenarios on the firm. we use stress testing to examine risks of specific portfolios as well as the potential impact of significant risk exposures across the firm. we use a variety of stress testing techniques to calculate the potential loss from a wide range of market moves on our portfolios, including sensitivity analysis, scenario analysis and firmwide stress tests. the results of our various stress tests are analyzed together for risk management purposes.
sensitivity analysis is used to quantify the impact of a market move in a single risk factor across all positions (e.g., equity prices or credit spreads) using a variety of defined market shocks, ranging from those that could be expected over a one-day time horizon up to those that could take many months to occur. we also use sensitivity analysis to quantify the impact of the default of any single entity, which captures the risk of large or concentrated exposures.
the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis scenario analysis is used to quantify the impact of a specified event, including how the event impacts multiple risk factors simultaneously. for example, for sovereign stress testing we calculate potential direct exposure associated with our sovereign inventory as well as the corresponding debt, equity and currency exposures associated with our non-sovereign inventory that may be impacted by the sovereign distress. when conducting scenario analysis, we typically consider a number of possible outcomes for each scenario, ranging from moderate to severely adverse market impacts. in addition, these stress tests are constructed using both historical events and forward-looking hypothetical scenarios.
firmwide stress testing combines market, credit, operational and liquidity risks into a single combined scenario. firmwide stress tests are primarily used to assess capital adequacy as part of our capital planning and stress testing process; however, we also ensure that firmwide stress testing is integrated into our risk governance framework. this includes selecting appropriate scenarios to use for our capital planning and stress testing process. see "equity capital management and regulatory capital Â— equity capital management" above for further information.
unlike var measures, which have an implied probability because they are calculated at a specified confidence level, there is generally no implied probability that our stress test scenarios will occur. instead, stress tests are used to model both moderate and more extreme moves in underlying market factors. when estimating potential loss, we generally assume that our positions cannot be reduced or hedged (although experience demonstrates that we are generally able to do so).
stress test scenarios are conducted on a regular basis as part of our routine risk management process and on an ad hoc basis in response to market events or concerns. stress testing is an important part of our risk management process because it allows us to quantify our exposure to tail risks, highlight potential loss concentrations, undertake risk/reward analysis, and assess and mitigate our risk positions.
limits. we use risk limits at various levels (including firmwide, business and product) to govern risk appetite by controlling the size of our exposures to market risk. limits are set based on var and on a range of stress tests relevant to our exposures. limits are reviewed frequently and amended on a permanent or temporary basis to reflect changing market conditions, business conditions or tolerance for risk.
the risk committee of the board and the risk governance committee (through delegated authority from the firmwide risk committee) approve market risk limits and sub-limits at firmwide, business and product levels, consistent with our risk appetite. in addition, market risk management (through delegated authority from the risk governance committee) sets market risk limits and sub-limits at certain product and desk levels.
the purpose of the firmwide limits is to assist senior management in controlling our overall risk profile. sub-limits are set below the approved level of risk limits. sub-limits set the desired maximum amount of exposure that may be managed by any particular business on a day-to-day basis without additional levels of senior management approval, effectively leaving day-to-day decisions to individual desk managers and traders. accordingly, sub-limits are a management tool designed to ensure appropriate escalation rather than to establish maximum risk tolerance. sub-limits also distribute risk among various businesses in a manner that is consistent with their level of activity and client demand, taking into account the relative performance of each area.
our market risk limits are monitored daily by market risk management, which is responsible for identifying and escalating, on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded.
when a risk limit has been exceeded (e.g., due to positional changes or changes in market conditions, such as increased volatilities or changes in correlations), it is escalated to senior managers in market risk management and/or the appropriate risk committee. such instances are remediated by an inventory reduction and/or a temporary or permanent increase to the risk limit.
model review and validation our var and stress testing models are regularly reviewed by market risk management and enhanced in order to incorporate changes in the composition of positions included in our market risk measures, as well as variations in market conditions. prior to implementing significant changes to our assumptions and/or models, model risk management performs model validations. significant changes to our var and stress testing models are reviewed with our chief risk officer and chief financial officer, and approved by the firmwide risk committee.
see "model risk management" for further information about the review and validation of these models.
96   goldman sachs 2016 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis systems we have made a significant investment in technology to monitor market risk including:
Â•   an independent calculation of var and stress measures;
Â•   risk measures calculated at individual position levels;
Â•   attribution of risk measures to individual risk factors of each position;
Â•   the ability to report many different views of the risk measures (e.g., by desk, business, product type or legal entity); and
Â•   the ability to produce ad hoc analyses in a timely manner.

the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis the chart below reflects our daily var over the last four quarters.
the chart below presents the frequency distribution of our daily trading net revenues for substantially all positions included in var for 2016.
daily trading net revenues are compared with var calculated as of the end of the prior business day. trading losses incurred on a single day did not exceed our 95% one-day var during 2016 and 2015 (i.e., a var exception) and exceeded our 95% one-day var on one occasion during 2014.
during periods in which we have significantly more positive net revenue days than net revenue loss days, we expect to have fewer var exceptions because, under normal conditions, our business model generally produces positive net revenues. in periods in which our franchise revenues are adversely affected, we generally have more loss days, resulting in more var exceptions. the daily market-making revenues used to determine var exceptions reflect the impact of any intraday activity, including bid/offer net revenues, which are more likely than not to be positive by their nature.
sensitivity measures certain portfolios and individual positions are not included in var because var is not the most appropriate risk measure. other sensitivity measures we use to analyze market risk are described below.
10% sensitivity measures. the table below presents market risk for positions that are not included in var. the market risk of these positions is determined by estimating the potential reduction in net revenues of a 10% decline in the value of these positions. equity positions below relate to private and restricted public equity securities, including interests in funds that invest in corporate equities and real estate and interests in hedge funds. debt positions include interests in funds that invest in corporate mezzanine and senior debt instruments, loans backed by commercial and residential real estate, corporate bank loans and other corporate debt, including acquired portfolios of distressed loans. these equity and debt positions in our consolidated statements of financial condition are included in "financial instruments owned, at fair value." see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about cash instruments. these measures do not reflect diversification benefits across asset categories or across other market risk measures.

the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis credit risk management, which is independent of the revenue-producing units and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing credit risk. the credit policy committee and the firmwide risk committee establish and review credit policies and parameters. in addition, we hold other positions that give rise to credit risk (e.g., bonds held in our inventory and secondary bank loans). these credit risks are captured as a component of market risk measures, which are monitored and managed by market risk management, consistent with other inventory positions. we also enter into derivatives to manage market risk exposures. such derivatives also give rise to credit risk, which is monitored and managed by credit risk management.
credit risk management process effective management of credit risk requires accurate and timely information, a high level of communication and knowledge of customers, countries, industries and products. our process for managing credit risk includes:
Â•   approving transactions and setting and communicating credit exposure limits;
Â•   establishing or approving underwriting standards;
Â•   monitoring compliance with established credit exposure limits;
Â•   assessing the likelihood that a counterparty will default on its payment obligations;
Â•   measuring our current and potential credit exposure and losses resulting from counterparty default;
Â•   reporting of credit exposures to senior management, the board and regulators;
Â•   using credit risk mitigants, including collateral and hedging; and
Â•   communicating and collaborating with other independent control and support functions such as operations, legal and compliance.
as part of the risk assessment process, credit risk management performs credit reviews, which include initial and ongoing analyses of our counterparties. for substantially all of our credit exposures, the core of our process is an annual counterparty credit review. a credit review is an independent analysis of the capacity and willingness of a counterparty to meet its financial obligations, resulting in an internal credit rating. the determination of internal credit ratings also incorporates assumptions with respect to the nature of and outlook for the counterparty's industry, and the economic environment. senior personnel within credit risk management, with expertise in specific industries, inspect and approve credit reviews and internal credit ratings.
our risk assessment process may also include, where applicable, reviewing certain key metrics, such as delinquency status, collateral values, credit scores and other risk factors.
our global credit risk management systems capture credit exposure to individual counterparties and on an aggregate basis to counterparties and their subsidiaries (economic groups). these systems also provide management with comprehensive information on our aggregate credit risk by product, internal credit rating, industry, country and region.
risk measures and limits we measure our credit risk based on the potential loss in the event of non-payment by a counterparty using current and potential exposure. for derivatives and securities financing transactions, current exposure represents the amount presently owed to us after taking into account applicable netting and collateral arrangements while potential exposure represents our estimate of the future exposure that could arise over the life of a transaction based on market movements within a specified confidence level. potential exposure also takes into account netting and collateral arrangements. for loans and lending commitments, the primary measure is a function of the notional amount of the position.
we use credit limits at various levels (e.g., counterparty, economic group, industry and country) as well as underwriting standards to control the size and nature of our credit exposures. limits for counterparties and economic groups are reviewed regularly and revised to reflect changing risk appetites for a given counterparty or group of counterparties. limits for industries and countries are based on our risk tolerance and are designed to allow for regular monitoring, review, escalation and management of credit risk concentrations. the risk committee of the board and the risk governance committee (through delegated authority from the firmwide risk committee) approve credit risk limits at firmwide, business and product levels. credit risk management (through delegated authority from the risk governance committee) sets credit limits for individual counterparties, economic groups, industries and countries. policies authorized by the firmwide risk committee, the risk governance committee and the credit policy committee prescribe the level of formal approval required for us to assume credit exposure to a counterparty across all product areas, taking into account any applicable netting provisions, collateral or other credit risk mitigants.
100   goldman sachs 2016 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis stress tests we use regular stress tests to calculate the credit exposures, including potential concentrations that would result from applying shocks to counterparty credit ratings or credit risk factors (e.g., currency rates, interest rates, equity prices). these shocks include a wide range of moderate and more extreme market movements. some of our stress tests include shocks to multiple risk factors, consistent with the occurrence of a severe market or economic event. in the case of sovereign default, we estimate the direct impact of the default on our sovereign credit exposures, changes to our credit exposures arising from potential market moves in response to the default, and the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers and counterparties that may result from the sovereign default. unlike potential exposure, which is calculated within a specified confidence level, with a stress test there is generally no assumed probability of these events occurring.
we perform stress tests on a regular basis as part of our routine risk management processes and conduct tailored stress tests on an ad hoc basis in response to market developments. stress tests are conducted jointly with our market and liquidity risk functions.
model review and validation our potential credit exposure and stress testing models, and any changes to such models or assumptions, are reviewed by model risk management. see "model risk management" for further information about the review and validation of these models.
risk mitigants to reduce our credit exposures on derivatives and securities financing transactions, we may enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. we may also reduce credit risk with counterparties by entering into agreements that enable us to obtain collateral from them on an upfront or contingent basis and/or to terminate transactions if the counterparty's credit rating falls below a specified level. we monitor the fair value of the collateral on a daily basis to ensure that our credit exposures are appropriately collateralized. we seek to minimize exposures where there is a significant positive correlation between the creditworthiness of our counterparties and the market value of collateral we receive.
for loans and lending commitments, depending on the credit quality of the borrower and other characteristics of the transaction, we employ a variety of potential risk mitigants. risk mitigants include collateral provisions, guarantees, covenants, structural seniority of the bank loan claims and, for certain lending commitments, provisions in the legal documentation that allow us to adjust loan amounts, pricing, structure and other terms as market conditions change. the type and structure of risk mitigants employed can significantly influence the degree of credit risk involved in a loan or lending commitment.
when we do not have sufficient visibility into a counterparty's financial strength or when we believe a counterparty requires support from its parent, we may obtain third-party guarantees of the counterparty's obligations. we may also mitigate our credit risk using credit derivatives or participation agreements.
credit exposures as of december 2016, our credit exposures increased as compared with december 2015, primarily reflecting an increase in cash deposits with central banks. the percentage of our credit exposures arising from non-investment-grade counterparties (based on our internally determined public rating agency equivalents) decreased as compared with december 2015, reflecting an increase in investment-grade credit exposure related to cash deposits with central banks and a decrease in non-investment-grade loans and lending commitments. during 2016, the number of counterparty defaults increased as compared with 2015 and such defaults primarily occurred within loans and lending commitments. the total number of counterparty defaults remained low, representing less than 0.5% of all counterparties. estimated losses associated with counterparty defaults were higher compared with 2015 and were not material. our credit exposures are described further below.
cash and cash equivalents. our credit exposure on cash and cash equivalents arises from our unrestricted cash, and includes both interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposits. to mitigate the risk of credit loss, we place substantially all of our deposits with highly-rated banks and central banks. unrestricted cash was $107.06 billion and $75.11 billion as of december 2016 and december 2015, respectively, and excludes cash segregated for regulatory and other purposes of $14.65 billion and $18.33 billion as of december 2016 and december 2015, respectively.
the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis otc derivatives. our credit exposure on otc derivatives arises primarily from our market-making activities. as a market maker, we enter into derivative transactions to provide liquidity to clients and to facilitate the transfer and hedging of their risks. we also enter into derivatives to manage market risk exposures. we manage our credit exposure on otc derivatives using the credit risk process, measures, limits and risk mitigants described above.
derivatives are reported on a net-by-counterparty basis (i.e., the net payable or receivable for derivative assets and liabilities for a given counterparty) when a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement. derivatives are accounted for at fair value, net of cash collateral received or posted under enforceable credit support agreements. we generally enter into otc derivatives transactions under bilateral collateral arrangements that require the daily exchange of collateral. as credit risk is an essential component of fair value, we include a credit valuation adjustment (cva) in the fair value of derivatives to reflect counterparty credit risk, as described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. cva is a function of the present value of expected exposure, the probability of counterparty default and the assumed recovery upon default.
the table below presents the distribution of our exposure to otc derivatives by tenor, both before and after the effect of collateral and netting agreements.

$28 billion as of both december 2016 and december 2015. the regional breakdown of our net credit exposure related to these activities was approximately 90% and 84% in the americas, approximately 8% and 14% in emea, and approximately
2% and 2% in asia as of december 2016 and december 2015, respectively. the fair value of the collateral received against such loans and lending commitments generally exceeded the gross carrying amount as of both december 2016 and december 2015.

selected exposures the section below provides information about our credit and market exposure to certain countries that have had heightened focus due to recent events and broad market concerns. credit exposure represents the potential for loss due to the default or deterioration in credit quality of a counterparty or borrower. market exposure represents the potential for loss in value of our long and short inventory due to changes in market prices.
current levels of oil prices continue to raise concerns about venezuela and nigeria, and their sovereign debt. the political situation in iraq has led to ongoing concerns about its economic stability. the debt crisis in mozambique has resulted in the suspension of its funding by the international monetary fund and the world bank, as well as credit rating downgrades. in addition, currency trading restrictions in malaysia have negatively impacted investor confidence and raised concerns about the potential for further restrictions.

104   goldman sachs 2016 form 10-k the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis we have a comprehensive framework to monitor, measure and assess our country exposures and to determine our risk appetite. we determine the country of risk by the location of the counterparty, issuer or underlier's assets, where they generate revenue, the country in which they are headquartered, the jurisdiction where a claim against them could be enforced, and/or the government whose policies affect their ability to repay their obligations. we monitor our credit exposure to a specific country both at the individual counterparty level as well as at the aggregate country level.
we use regular stress tests, described above, to calculate the credit exposures, including potential concentrations that would result from applying shocks to counterparty credit ratings or credit risk factors. to supplement these regular stress tests, we also conduct tailored stress tests on an ad hoc basis in response to specific market events that we deem significant. these stress tests are designed to estimate the direct impact of the event on our credit and market exposures resulting from shocks to risk factors including, but not limited to, currency rates, interest rates, and equity prices. we also utilize these stress tests to estimate the indirect impact of certain hypothetical events on our country exposures, such as the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers and counterparties along with the shocks to the risk factors described above. the parameters of these shocks vary based on the scenario reflected in each stress test. we review estimated losses produced by the stress tests in order to understand their magnitude, highlight potential loss concentrations, and assess and mitigate our exposures where necessary.
see "stress tests" above, "liquidity risk management Â— liquidity stress tests" and "market risk management Â— market risk management process  Â— stress testing" for further information about stress tests.
operational risk management overview operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. our exposure to operational risk arises from routine processing errors as well as extraordinary incidents, such as major systems failures or legal and regulatory matters.
potential types of loss events related to internal and external operational risk include:
Â•   clients, products and business practices;
Â•   execution, delivery and process management;
Â•   business disruption and system failures;
Â•   employment practices and workplace safety;
Â•   damage to physical assets;
Â•   internal fraud; and
Â•   external fraud.
we maintain a comprehensive control framework designed to provide a well-controlled environment to minimize operational risks. the firmwide operational risk committee provides oversight of the ongoing development and implementation of our operational risk policies and framework. operational risk management is a risk management function independent of our revenue-producing units, reports to our chief risk officer, and is responsible for developing and implementing policies, methodologies and a formalized framework for operational risk management with the goal of minimizing our exposure to operational risk.
operational risk management process managing operational risk requires timely and accurate information as well as a strong control culture. we seek to manage our operational risk through:
Â•   training, supervision and development of our people;
Â•   active participation of senior management in identifying and mitigating our key operational risks;
Â•      independent control and support functions that monitor operational risk on a daily basis, and implementation of extensive policies and procedures, and controls designed to prevent the occurrence of operational risk events;
Â•   proactive communication between our revenue producing units and our independent control and support functions;
and
Â•   a network of systems to facilitate the collection of data used to analyze and assess our operational risk exposure.
we combine top-down and bottom-up approaches to manage and measure operational risk. from a top-down perspective, our senior management assesses firmwide and business-level operational risk profiles. from a bottom-up perspective, revenue-producing units and independent control and support functions are responsible for risk identification and risk management on a day-to-day basis, including escalating operational risks to senior management.
our operational risk management framework is in part designed to comply with the operational risk measurement rules under the revised capital framework and has evolved based on the changing needs of our businesses and regulatory guidance.
the goldman sachs group, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis our operational risk management framework comprises the following practices:
Â•   risk identification and assessment;
Â•   risk measurement; and
Â•   risk monitoring and reporting.
internal audit performs an independent review of our operational risk management framework, including our key controls, processes and applications, on an annual basis to assess the effectiveness of our framework.
risk identification and assessment the core of our operational risk management framework is risk identification and assessment. we have a comprehensive data collection process, including firmwide policies and procedures, for operational risk events.
we have established policies that require our revenue-producing units and our independent control and support functions to report and escalate operational risk events. when operational risk events are identified, our policies require that the events be documented and analyzed to determine whether changes are required in our systems and/or processes to further mitigate the risk of future events.
in addition, our systems capture internal operational risk event data, key metrics such as transaction volumes, and statistical information such as performance trends. we use an internally developed operational risk management application to aggregate and organize this information. one of our key risk identification and assessment tools is an operational risk and control self-assessment process which is performed by managers from both revenue-producing units and independent control and support functions. this process consists of the identification and rating of operational risks, on a forward-looking basis, and the related controls. the results from this process are analyzed to evaluate operational risk exposures and identify businesses, activities or products with heightened levels of operational risk.
risk measurement we measure our operational risk exposure over a twelve-month time horizon using both statistical modeling and scenario analyses, which involve qualitative assessments of the potential frequency and extent of potential operational risk losses, for each of our businesses. operational risk measurement incorporates qualitative and quantitative assessments of factors including:
Â•   internal and external operational risk event data;
Â•   assessments of our internal controls;
Â•   evaluations of the complexity of our business activities;
Â•   the degree of and potential for automation in our processes;
Â•   new activity information;
Â•   the legal and regulatory environment;
Â•   changes in the markets for our products and services, including the diversity and sophistication of our customers and counterparties; and
Â•   liquidity of the capital markets and the reliability of the infrastructure that supports the capital markets.
the results from these scenario analyses are used to monitor changes in operational risk and to determine business lines that may have heightened exposure to operational risk. these analyses ultimately are used in the determination of the appropriate level of operational risk capital to hold.
risk monitoring and reporting we evaluate changes in the operational risk profile of the firm and its businesses, including changes in business mix or jurisdictions in which we operate, by monitoring the factors noted above at a firmwide level. we have both preventive and detective internal controls, which are designed to reduce the frequency and severity of operational risk losses and the probability of operational risk events. we monitor the results of assessments and independent internal audits of these internal controls.
we also provide periodic operational risk reports to senior management, risk committees and the board. in addition, we have established thresholds to monitor the impact of an operational risk event, including single loss events and cumulative losses over a twelve-month period, as well as escalation protocols. we also provide periodic operational risk reports, which include incidents that breach escalation thresholds, to senior management, firmwide and divisional risk committees and the risk committee of the board.
model review and validation the statistical models utilized by operational risk management are subject to independent review and validation by model risk management. see "model risk management" for further information about the review and validation of these models.

our model risk management framework is managed through a governance structure and risk management controls, which encompass standards designed to ensure we maintain a comprehensive model inventory, including risk assessment and classification, sound model development practices, independent review and model-specific usage controls. the firmwide risk committee and the firmwide model risk control committee oversee our model risk management framework. model risk management, which is independent of model developers, model owners and model users, reports to our chief risk officer, is responsible for identifying and reporting significant risks associated with models, and provides periodic updates to senior management, risk committees and the risk committee of the board.
model review and validation model risk management consists of quantitative professionals who perform an independent review, validation and approval of our models. this review includes an analysis of the model documentation, independent testing, an assessment of the appropriateness of the methodology used, and verification of compliance with model development and implementation standards. model risk management reviews all existing models on an annual basis, as well as new models or significant changes to models.
the model validation process incorporates a review of models and trade and risk parameters across a broad range of scenarios (including extreme conditions) in order to critically evaluate and verify:
Â•   the model's conceptual soundness, including the reasonableness of model assumptions, and suitability for intended use;
Â•   the testing strategy utilized by the model developers to ensure that the models function as intended;
Â•   the suitability of the calculation techniques incorporated in the model;
Â•   the model's accuracy in reflecting the characteristics of the related product and its significant risks;
Â•   the model's consistency with models for similar products; and
Â•   the model's sensitivity to input parameters and assumptions.

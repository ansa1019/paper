item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
description of merck's business merck & co., inc. (merck or the company) is a global health care company that delivers innovative health solutions through its prescription medicines, vaccines, biologic therapies and animal health products. the company's operations are principally managed on a products basis and include four operating segments, which are the pharmaceutical, animal health, healthcare services and alliances segments. the pharmaceutical segment is the only reportable segment.
the pharmaceutical segment includes human health pharmaceutical and vaccine products marketed either directly by the company or through joint ventures. human health pharmaceutical products consist of therapeutic and preventive agents, generally sold by prescription, for the treatment of human disorders. the company sells these human health pharmaceutical products primarily to drug wholesalers and retailers, hospitals, government agencies and managed health care providers such as health maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefit managers and other institutions. vaccine products consist of preventive pediatric, adolescent and adult vaccines, primarily administered at physician offices. the company sells these human health vaccines primarily to physicians, wholesalers, physician distributors and government entities. sales of vaccines in most major european markets were marketed through the company's sanofi pasteur msd (spmsd) joint venture until its termination on december 31, 2016. beginning in 2017, merck will record vaccine sales in the european markets that were previously part of the joint venture.
the company also has animal health operations that discover, develop, manufacture and market animal health products, including vaccines, which the company sells to veterinarians, distributors and animal producers. the company's healthcare services segment provides services and solutions that focus on engagement, health analytics and clinical services to improve the value of care delivered to patients. merck's alliances segment primarily includes results from the company's relationship with astrazeneca lp until the termination of that relationship on june 30, 2014. on october 1, 2014, the company divested its consumer care segment that developed, manufactured and marketed over-the-counter, foot care and sun care products.
overview during 2016, merck continued to execute its innovation strategy and the company's sustained investment in research yielded a number of recent approvals and regulatory milestones across various therapeutic areas. the company received several approvals in 2016 that include expanded indications for keytruda, the company's anti-pd-1 (programmed death receptor-1) therapy, which was approved by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) for the first-line treatment of metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc), as well as for the treatment of head and neck cancer. additionally, in 2016, both the fda and the european commission (ec) approved zepatier, a once-daily, single tablet combination therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c virus (hcv) genotype (gt) 1 or gt4 infection, with ribavirin in certain patient populations.
worldwide sales were $39.8 billion in 2016, an increase of 1% compared with 2015, including a 2% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. sales growth was driven by oncology, hcv, vaccine, and hospital acute care products, reflecting in part the ongoing launches of keytruda, zepatier and bridion, as well as positive performance from merck's animal health business. growth in these areas was largely offset by the effects of generic and biosimilar competition that resulted in declines for products such as remicade and nasonex.
business development remains an important component of the company's overall strategy as merck seeks to identify the best external innovation to augment its portfolio and pipeline, with a particular focus on early-to-mid-stage pipeline assets. merck looks for growth opportunities that meet the company's strategic criteria. while looking for the best scientific opportunities, merck remains financially disciplined, pursuing those business opportunities that the company believes can contribute to long-term growth and sustainable value for shareholders.
in january 2016, merck acquired iomet pharma ltd (iomet), a drug discovery company focused on the development of innovative medicines for the treatment of cancer, with a particular emphasis on the fields of cancer immunotherapy and cancer metabolism. in july 2016, merck acquired afferent pharmaceuticals (afferent), a privately held pharmaceutical company focused on the development of therapeutic candidates targeting the p2x3 receptor for the treatment of common, poorly-managed, neurogenic conditions, such as chronic cough. in addition, in 2016, merck entered into a strategic collaboration and license agreement with moderna therapeutics (moderna) to develop and commercialize novel messenger rna (mrna)-based personalized cancer vaccines.

merck continues to support its in-line portfolio, as well as ongoing and upcoming product launches. keytruda is launching around the world in multiple indications. in 2016, merck achieved multiple additional regulatory milestones for keytruda including approval from the fda for the first-line treatment of patients with nsclc whose tumors have high pd-l1 expression (tumor proportion score [tps] of 50% or more) as determined by an fda-approved test, with no egfr or alk genomic tumor aberrations and also for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. additionally, in 2016, the ec approved keytruda for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic nsclc in patients whose tumors express pd-l1 and who have received at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. in january 2017, the ec approved keytruda for the first-line treatment of metastatic nsclc in adults whose tumors have high pd-l1 expression (tps of 50% or more) with no egfr or alk positive tumor mutations. additionally, the company is continuing its launch of zepatier in the united states and in emerging markets and is now launching in the european union (eu) and in japan.
merck is focusing its research efforts on the therapeutic areas that it believes can have the most impact on human health, such as oncology, diabetes, cardiometabolic disease, resistant microbial infection and alzheimer's disease. in addition to the recent regulatory approvals discussed above, the company has continued to advance other programs in its late-stage pipeline with several regulatory submissions. merck has five supplemental biologics license applications (sbla) under priority review with the fda for keytruda including: for use in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic or advanced non-squamous nsclc regardless of pd-l1 expression and with no egfr or alk genomic tumor aberrations; for the treatment of patients with classical hodgkin lymphoma; for the treatment of previously treated patients with advanced microsatellite instability-high cancer; for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer, including most bladder cancers; and for the second-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. merck is driving a broad immuno-oncology development program and investing in the long-term potential for keytruda to become foundational in the treatment of a range of cancers. the keytruda clinical development program includes more than 400 clinical trials in more than 30 tumor types; over 200 of these trials combine keytruda with other cancer treatments. mk-1293, an insulin glargine candidate for the treatment of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes being developed in a collaboration, is also under review with the fda.
in addition to phase 3 programs for keytruda in the therapeutic areas of breast, colorectal, esophageal, gastric, hepatocellular, multiple myeloma, and renal cancers, the company also has candidates in phase 3 clinical development in several other therapeutic areas (see "research and development" below).
during the past year, the company continued its focus on productivity improvements, looking for opportunities to reallocate resources across the portfolio to grow its strongest brands and to support the most promising assets in its pipeline. marketing and administrative expenses declined in 2016 as compared with 2015 reflecting in part this continued focus by the company on prioritizing its resources to the highest growth areas. research and development expenses in 2016 reflect increased clinical development spending as the company continues to invest in the pipeline.
in november 2016, merck's board of directors raised the company's quarterly dividend to $0.47 per share from $0.46 per share. during 2016, the company returned $8.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
in january 2017, merck entered into a settlement and license agreement to resolve worldwide patent infringement litigation related to keytruda. in connection with the settlement, merck recorded a pretax charge of $625 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 (see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements).
earnings per common share assuming dilution attributable to common shareholders (eps) for 2016 were $1.41 compared with $1.56 in 2015. eps in both years reflect the impact of acquisition and divestiture-related costs, including a charge in 2016 related to the uprifosbuvir clinical development program, as well as restructuring costs and certain other items. non-gaap eps, which excludes these items, were $3.78 in 2016 and $3.59 in 2015 (see "non-gaap income and non-gaap eps" below).

operating results sales worldwide sales were $39.8 billion in 2016, an increase of 1% compared with 2015. foreign exchange unfavorably affected global sales performance by 2% in 2016, which includes a lower benefit from revenue hedging activities as compared with 2015. revenue growth primarily reflects higher sales in the oncology franchise largely from keytruda, the launch of the hcv treatment zepatier, and growth in vaccine products, including gardasil/gardasil 9, varivax and pneumovax 23. also contributing to sales growth in 2016 were higher sales of hospital acute care products including bridion and noxafil, growth within the diabetes franchise of januvia and janumet, as well as higher sales of animal health products, particularly bravecto. these increases were partially offset by sales declines attributable to the ongoing effects of generic and biosimilar competition for certain products, including remicade and nasonex, along with other products within diversified brands. declines in isentress, pegintron and dulera inhalation aerosol also partially offset revenue growth in 2016. sales performance in 2016 reflects a decline of approximately $625 million due to reduced operations by the company in venezuela as a result of evolving economic conditions and volatility in that country.
sales in the united states were $18.5 billion in 2016, an increase of 5% compared with $17.5 billion in 2015. within the pharmaceutical segment, sales in the united states grew 5% in 2016 driven primarily by the launches of zepatier and bridion, along with higher sales of keytruda and gardasil/gardasil 9, partially offset by lower sales of nasonex, cubicin, dulera inhalation aerosol, and isentress.
international sales were $21.3 billion in 2016, a decline of 3% compared with $22.0 billion in 2015. foreign exchange unfavorably affected international sales performance by 4% in 2016. international sales within the pharmaceutical segment declined 3% in 2016, including a 3% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange, largely reflecting declines in certain emerging markets, offset by an increase in japan. sales in emerging markets were $6.7 billion in 2016, a decline of 9% including a 6% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange, driven primarily by reduced operations in venezuela, partially offset by growth in other markets. sales in japan grew 6% in 2016, to $2.8 billion, which includes a 10% favorable effect from foreign exchange. excluding the favorable effect of foreign exchange, the sales decline in japan was largely driven by the loss of market exclusivity for singulair combined with the ongoing generic erosion for products within diversified brands, partially offset by higher sales of belsomra. sales in europe were $7.7 billion in 2016, essentially flat as compared with 2015, including a 2% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange, sales performance in europe primarily reflects volume growth in keytruda, cubicin, simponi, adempas, liptruzet, and the januvia franchise, partially offset by ongoing biosimilar competition and generic erosion for certain products, particularly remicade, and other pricing pressures in this region. total international sales represented 54% and 56% of total sales in 2016 and 2015, respectively.
global efforts toward health care cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing and market access worldwide. in the united states, health care reform is contributing to an increase in the number of patients in the medicaid program under which sales of pharmaceutical products are subject to substantial rebates. in many international markets, government-mandated pricing actions have reduced prices of generic and patented drugs. in addition, other austerity measures negatively affected the company's revenue performance in 2016. the company anticipates these pricing actions and other austerity measures will continue to negatively affect revenue performance in 2017.

worldwide sales were $39.5 billion in 2015, a decline of 6% compared with 2014 including a 6% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. the acquisition of cubist pharmaceuticals, inc. (cubist) in 2015, the divestiture of merck's consumer care (mcc) business in 2014, as well as product divestitures and the termination of the company's relationship with astrazeneca lp (azlp) also in 2014, as discussed below, had a net unfavorable impact to sales of approximately 3%. in addition, sales performance in 2015 reflects declines in pegintron and victrelis, remicade, pneumovax 23, nasonex, and vytorin. these declines were partially offset by volume growth in keytruda, januvia and janumet, gardasil/gardasil 9, noxafil, simponi, implanon/nexplanon, invanz, dulera inhalation aerosol, and bridion, as well as volume growth in animal health products and higher third-party manufacturing sales.
in january 2015, the company acquired cubist, which contributed sales of $1.3 billion to merck's revenues in 2015. in 2014, the company divested certain ophthalmic products in several international markets (most of which closed on july 1, 2014). in addition, on october 1, 2014, the company divested its mcc business including the prescription rights to claritin and afrin. the sales decline in 2015 attributable to these divestitures was approximately $1.9 billion of which $1.5 billion related to the consumer care segment and $400 million related to the pharmaceutical segment. also, in 2014, the company sold the u.s. marketing rights to saphris, an antipsychotic indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar i disorder in adults, which resulted in revenue of $232 million. additionally, the company's relationship with azlp terminated on june 30, 2014; therefore, effective july 1, 2014, the company no longer records supply sales to azlp. these supply sales were $463 million in 2014 through the termination date and were reflected in the alliances segment.

pharmaceutical segment primary care and women's health cardiovascular combined global sales of zetia (marketed in most countries outside the united states as ezetrol ) and vytorin (marketed outside the united states as inegy), medicines for lowering ldl cholesterol, were $3.7 billion in 2016, a decline of 2% compared with 2015 including a 1% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. in addition, in 2016, the company recorded sales of $146 million for atozet, a medicine for lowering ldl cholesterol, which the company markets in certain countries outside of the united states. global sales of the ezetimibe family (including atozet) were $3.8 billion in 2016, growth of 1% compared with 2015, reflecting volume growth in europe and higher pricing in the united states, largely offset by lower sales in venezuela due to reduced operations in this country and lower volumes in the united states reflecting in part generic competition for zetia. by agreement, a generic manufacturer launched a generic version of zetia in the united states in december 2016 and the company is experiencing a rapid decline in u.s. zetia sales. the company anticipates the decline will accelerate in future periods. the u.s. patent and exclusivity periods for zetia and vytorin otherwise expire in april 2017 and the company anticipates declines in u.s. zetia and vytorin sales thereafter. u.s. sales of zetia and vytorin were $1.6 billion and $473 million, respectively, in 2016. the company has market exclusivity in major european markets for ezetrol until april 2018 and for inegy until april 2019. combined worldwide sales of the ezetimibe family were $3.8 billion in 2015, a decline of 9% compared with 2014 including an 8% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. the sales decline was driven primarily by lower volumes of ezetrol in canada where it lost market exclusivity in september 2014, as well as by lower volumes in the united states, partially offset by higher pricing in the united states.
pursuant to a collaboration between merck and bayer ag (bayer) (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements), merck has lead commercial rights for adempas, a novel cardiovascular drug for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, in countries outside the americas while bayer has lead rights in the americas, including the united states. in 2016, merck began promoting and distributing adempas in europe. transition in other merck territories will continue in 2017. merck recorded sales for adempas of $169 million in 2016, which includes sales in merck's marketing territories, as well as merck's share of profits from the sale of adempas in bayer's marketing territories.
in september 2016, merck sold the marketing rights for zontivity in the united states and canada to aralez pharmaceuticals inc. for a $25 million upfront payment and royalties at graduated rates, plus potential future consideration dependent upon the achievement of certain aggregate annual sales-based milestones. previously, in march 2016, following several business decisions that reduced sales expectations for zontivity in the united states and europe, the company lowered its cash flow projections for zontivity. the company utilized market participant assumptions and considered several different scenarios to determine the fair value of the intangible asset related to zontivity that, when compared with its related carrying value, resulted in an impairment charge of $252 million recorded in materials and production costs in 2016.
diabetes worldwide combined sales of januvia and janumet, medicines that help lower blood sugar levels in adults with type 2 diabetes, were $6.1 billion in 2016, an increase of 2% compared with 2015. sales growth was driven primarily by higher volumes in the united states, europe and canada, partially offset by pricing pressures in the united states and europe, and lower sales in venezuela due to the company's reduced operations in that country. combined global sales of januvia and janumet were $6.0 billion in 2015, essentially flat as compared with 2014 including a 7% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. sales performance reflects higher volumes and pricing in the united states, as well as volume growth in emerging markets and europe. volume declines of co-marketed sitagliptin in japan due to the timing of sales to the licensee partially offset growth in 2015.
general medicine and women's health worldwide sales of nuvaring, a vaginal contraceptive product, were $777 million in 2016, an increase of 6% compared with 2015, and were $732 million in 2015, an increase of 1% compared with 2014. foreign exchange unfavorably affected global sales performance by 1% and 7% in 2016 and 2015, respectively. sales growth in both years largely reflects higher pricing in the united states. volume declines in europe partially offset revenue growth in 2016. in august 2016, the u.s. district court ruled that the company's delivery system patent for nuvaring is invalid. the company is appealing this verdict to the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit. however, given the u.s. district court's decision, there may be generic entrants into the u.s. market in advance of the april 2018 patent
38
expiration. if this should occur, the company anticipates a significant decline in u.s. nuvaring sales thereafter. u.s. sales of nuvaring were $576 million in 2016. as a result of the unfavorable u.s. district court decision, the company evaluated the intangible asset related to nuvaring for impairment and concluded that it was not impaired. the intangible asset value for nuvaring was $319 million at december 31, 2016.
worldwide sales of implanon/nexplanon, single-rod subdermal contraceptive implants, grew to $606 million in 2016, an increase of 3% compared with 2015 including a 3% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. sales growth reflects higher demand in the united states, partially offset by declines in certain emerging markets, particularly in venezuela. implanon/nexplanon sales rose to $588 million in 2015, a 17% increase compared with 2014 including a 6% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. the increase was driven primarily by higher demand in the united states and in emerging markets.
global sales of dulera inhalation aerosol, a combination medicine for the treatment of asthma, were $436 million in 2016, a decline of 19% compared with 2015 including a 1% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. the decline was driven by lower sales in the united sales reflecting competitive pricing pressures that were partially offset by higher demand. worldwide sales of dulera inhalation aerosol grew 16% in 2015 to $536 million driven primarily by higher demand in the united states.
global sales of follistim aq (marketed in most countries outside the united states as puregon), a fertility treatment, were $355 million in 2016, a decline of 7% compared with 2015 including a 2% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. the sales decline primarily reflects lower volumes in europe due in part to supply issues and lower demand in certain emerging markets. worldwide sales of follistim aq were $383 million in 2015, a decline of 7% compared with 2014, reflecting a 9% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange that was offset by higher pricing in the united states.
in 2016, the company determined that, for business reasons, it would terminate the north america partnership agreement with alk-abelló that included both grastek and ragwitek allergy immunotherapy tablets for sublingual use. this decision was not due to efficacy or safety concerns for the tablets. merck provided alk-abelló with six months' notice that it is terminating the agreement and therefore these compounds will be returned to alk-abelló. in connection with this decision, the company wrote-off $95 million of intangible assets related to these products (see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements).
hospital and specialty hepatitis global sales of zepatier were $555 million in 2016. zepatier was approved by the fda in january 2016 for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hcv gt1 or gt4 infection, with ribavirin in certain patient populations. zepatier was approved by the ec in july 2016 and became available in european markets in late november 2016. launches are expected to continue across the eu in 2017. the company is also launching zepatier in japan and in emerging markets.
worldwide sales of pegintron, a treatment for chronic hcv, declined 65% in 2016 to $63 million and decreased 52% in 2015 to $182 million. the declines were driven by lower volumes in nearly all regions as the availability of newer therapeutic options resulted in continued loss of market share.
global sales of victrelis, an oral medicine for the treatment of chronic hcv, were $18 million in 2015, a decline of 89% compared with sales of $153 million in 2014, driven by lower volumes in europe and emerging markets as the availability of newer therapeutic options resulted in continued loss of market share. sale of victrelis were de minimis in 2016.
hiv worldwide sales of isentress, an hiv integrase inhibitor for use in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of hiv-1 infection, were $1.4 billion in 2016, a decline of 8% compared with 2015 including a 2% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. the sales decline was driven primarily by lower volumes in the united states, as well as lower demand and pricing in europe due to competitive pressures, partially offset by a favorable adjustment to discount reserves in the united states and higher demand in certain emerging markets. global sales of isentress were $1.5 billion in 2015, a decline of 10% compared with 2014 including an 8% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. the decline was driven primarily by lower volumes in the united states and lower demand and
39
pricing in europe due to competitive pressures, partially offset by higher volumes in latin america and higher pricing in the united states.
hospital acute care global sales of cubicin, an i.v. antibiotic for complicated skin and skin structure infections or bacteremia when caused by designated susceptible organisms, were $1.1 billion in 2016, a decline of 4% compared with 2015. the u.s. composition patent for cubicin expired in june 2016 and the company is experiencing a significant decline in u.s. cubicin sales and expects the decline to continue. the sales decline in the united states was partially offset by sales of cubicin in certain international markets for which the company acquired marketing rights in the fourth quarter of 2015 (including europe, latin america, australia, new zealand, china, south africa and certain other asia pacific countries). the company anticipates it will lose market exclusivity for cubicin in europe in 2017.
worldwide sales of noxafil, for the prevention of invasive fungal infections, grew 22% in 2016 to $595 million driven primarily by higher pricing in the united states, volume growth in europe reflecting an ongoing positive impact from the approval of new formulations, and higher demand in emerging markets. global sales of noxafil rose 21% in 2015 to $487 million driven by pricing and higher demand in the united states, as well as volume growth in europe reflecting a positive impact from the approval of new formulations. foreign exchange unfavorably affected global sales performance by 3% in 2016 and 12% in 2015.
global sales of invanz, for the treatment of certain infections, were $561 million in 2016, a decline of 1% compared with 2015 including a 2% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. sales performance in 2016 reflects volume growth in certain emerging markets and higher pricing in the united states, largely offset by a decline in venezuela. worldwide sales of invanz were $569 million in 2015, an increase of 8% compared with 2014, reflecting higher sales in the united states and volume growth in emerging markets that was partially offset by a 9% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. the company will lose u.s. patent protection for invanz in november 2017 and the company anticipates a significant decline in u.s. invanz sales thereafter. u.s. sales of invanz were $329 million in 2016.
global sales of cancidas, an anti-fungal product sold primarily outside of the united states, were $558 million in 2016, a decline of 3% compared with 2015, reflecting a 4% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange and pricing declines in europe that were offset by higher volumes in certain emerging markets, particularly in china. worldwide sales of cancidas were $573 million in 2015, a decrease of 16% compared with 2014 reflecting a 12% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange and volume declines in certain emerging markets. the eu compound patent for cancidas expires in april 2017 and the company anticipates a decline in cancidas sales in those european markets thereafter. sales of cancidas in europe were $297 million in 2016.
global sales of bridion, for the reversal of two types of neuromuscular blocking agents used during surgery, were $482 million in 2016, growth of 37% compared with 2015 including a 2% favorable effect from foreign exchange. sales growth reflects volume growth in most markets, including in the united states where it was approved by the fda in december 2015, partially offset by a decline in venezuela due to reduced operations by the company in this country. sales of bridion increased 4% in 2015 to $353 million driven by volume growth in international markets. foreign exchange unfavorably affected global sales performance by 19% in 2015.
in october 2016, merck announced that the fda approved zinplava injection 25 mg/ml. zinplava is indicated to reduce recurrence of clostridium difficile infection (cdi) in patients 18 years of age or older who are receiving antibacterial drug treatment of cdi and are at high risk for cdi recurrence. zinplava became available in the united states in february 2017. zinplava was approved by the ec in january 2017. the company anticipates zinplava will be available in the eu in march 2017.

40
sales of simponi, a once-monthly subcutaneous treatment for certain inflammatory diseases (marketed by the company in europe, russia and turkey), were $766 million in 2016, an increase of 11% compared with 2015 including a 3% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. sales growth was driven primarily by higher volumes in europe reflecting in part an ongoing positive impact from the ulcerative colitis indication. sales of simponi were $690 million in 2015, essentially flat as compared with 2014, driven by higher demand in europe, reflecting in part an ongoing positive impact from the ulcerative colitis indication, which was offset by a 19% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange.
oncology sales of keytruda, an anti-pd-1 therapy, were $1.4 billion in 2016, $566 million in 2015 and $55 million in 2014. the year-over-year increases primarily reflect higher sales in the united states, europe and in emerging markets as the company continues to launch keytruda.
in october 2016, merck announced that the fda approved keytruda for the first-line treatment of patients with nsclc whose tumors have high pd-l1 expression (tps of 50% or more) as determined by an fda-approved test, with no egfr or alk genomic tumor aberrations. with this new indication, keytruda is now the only anti-pd-1 therapy to be approved in the first-line treatment setting for these patients. in addition, the fda approved a labeling update to include data from keynote-010 in the second-line or greater treatment setting for patients with metastatic nsclc whose tumors express pd-l1 (tps of 1% or more) as determined by an fda-approved test, with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. patients with egfr or alk genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on fda-approved therapy for these aberrations prior to receiving keytruda. in december 2016, keytruda was approved in japan for the treatment of certain patients with pd-l1-positive unresectable advanced/recurrent nsclc in the first- and second-line treatment settings. additionally, in january 2017, the ec approved keytruda for the first-line treatment of metastatic nsclc in adults whose tumors have high pd-l1 expression (tps of 50% or more) with no egfr or alk positive tumor mutations.
in august 2016, merck announced that the fda approved keytruda for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (hnscc) with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy.
keytruda is now approved in the united states and in the eu for the treatment of previously untreated metastatic nsclc in patients whose tumors express high levels of pd-l1 and previously treated metastatic nsclc in patients whose tumors express pd-l1, as well as for the treatment of advanced melanoma. keytruda is also approved in the united states for previously treated recurrent or metastatic hnscc. the company has launched keytruda in over 50 markets globally.
merck has five sblas under priority review with the fda for keytruda including: for use in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic or advanced non-squamous nsclc regardless of pd-l1 expression and with no egfr or alk genomic tumor aberrations; for the treatment of patients with classical hodgkin lymphoma; for the treatment of previously treated patients with advanced microsatellite instability-high cancer; for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer, including most bladder cancers; and for the second-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. the company plans additional regulatory filings in the united states and other countries. the keytruda clinical development program includes studies across a broad range of cancer types (see "research and development" below). in january 2017, merck entered into a settlement and license agreement to resolve worldwide patent infringement litigation related to keytruda (see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements).
global sales of emend, for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced and post-operative nausea and vomiting, were $549 million in 2016, an increase of 3% compared with 2015 including a 1% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange, largely reflecting higher pricing in the united states, partially offset by volume declines in japan. in february 2016, merck announced that the fda approved a supplemental new drug application for single-dose emend for injection for the prevention of delayed nausea and vomiting in adults receiving initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. worldwide sales of emend were $535 million in 2015, a decline of 3% reflecting a 6% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange that was partially offset by higher pricing in the united states and volume growth in europe.

respiratory worldwide sales of singulair, a once-a-day oral medicine for the chronic treatment of asthma and for the relief of symptoms of allergic rhinitis, were $915 million in 2016, a decrease of 2% compared with 2015 including a 2% favorable effect from foreign exchange. sales performance primarily reflects lower volumes in japan. the patents that provided market exclusivity for singulair in japan expired in february and october of 2016. as a result, the company is experiencing singulair volume declines in japan and expects the decline to continue. singulair sales in japan were $455 million in 2016. in years prior to 2016, the company lost market exclusivity for singulair in the united states and in most major international markets with the exception of japan. the company no longer has market exclusivity for singulair in any major market. global sales of singulair were $931 million in 2015, a decline of 15% compared with 2014 including a 10% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. the sales decline in 2015 was driven primarily by lower volumes in japan and lower demand in europe as a result of generic competition.
global sales of nasonex, an inhaled nasal corticosteroid for the treatment of nasal allergy symptoms, were $537 million in 2016, a decline of 37% compared with 2015, driven primarily by lower volumes in the united states resulting from generic competition. in march 2016, apotex launched a generic version of nasonex in the united states pursuant to a june 2012 u.s. district court for the district of new jersey ruling (upheld on appeal to the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit) holding that apotex's generic version of nasonex does not infringe on the company's formulation patent. accordingly, the company is experiencing a substantial decline in u.s. nasonex sales and expects the decline to continue. the decline in global nasonex sales in 2016 was also driven by lower volumes and pricing in europe from ongoing generic erosion and lower sales in venezuela due to reduced operations by the company in this country. worldwide sales of nasonex were $858 million in 2015, a decline of 22% compared with 2014 including a 6% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. the decline was driven primarily by lower volumes in the united states reflecting competition from alternative generic treatment options, as well as from supply constraints. in addition, lower volumes and pricing in europe from ongoing generic erosion also contributed to the nasonex sales decline in 2015.
other global sales of cozaar and its companion agent hyzaar (a combination of cozaar and hydrochlorothiazide), treatments for hypertension, declined 23% in 2016 to $511 million and decreased 17% in 2015 to $667 million. foreign exchange unfavorably affected global sales performance by 3% and 9% in 2016 and 2015, respectively. the patents that provided market exclusivity for cozaar and hyzaar in the united states and in most major international markets have expired. accordingly, the company is experiencing declines in cozaar and hyzaar sales and expects the declines to continue.
vaccines the following discussion of vaccines does not include sales of vaccines sold in most major european markets through spmsd, the company's joint venture with sanofi pasteur (sanofi), the results of which are reflected in equity income from affiliates included in other (income) expense, net (see "selected joint venture and affiliate information" below). supply sales to spmsd, however, are included. on december 31, 2016, merck and sanofi terminated spmsd and ended their joint vaccines operations in europe (see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements). beginning in 2017, merck will record vaccine sales in the european markets that were previously part of the spmsd joint venture.
merck's sales of gardasil/gardasil 9, vaccines to help prevent certain cancers and diseases caused by certain types of hpv, were $2.2 billion in 2016, growth of 14% compared with 2015. sales growth was driven primarily by higher volumes and pricing in the united states, as well as higher demand in certain emerging markets that was partially offset by a decline in government tenders in brazil. in october 2016, the fda approved a 2-dose vaccination regimen for gardasil 9, for use in girls and boys 9 through 14 years of age, and the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention's advisory committee on immunization practices voted to recommend the 2-dose vaccination regimen for certain 9 through 14 year olds. the company anticipates the 2-dose vaccination regimen will have an unfavorable effect on sales of gardasil 9 during the period of transition. merck's sales of gardasil/gardasil 9 were $1.9 billion in 2015, an increase of 10% compared with 2014 including a 1% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. sales growth
42
was driven primarily by higher sales in the united states resulting from higher pricing and increased volumes reflecting the timing of public sector purchases, as well as increased government tenders in the asia pacific region, partially offset by declines in latin america due to both price and volume. gardasil 9, merck's 9-valent hpv vaccine, was approved by the fda in december 2014 for use in females 9 through 26 years of age, and males 9 through 15 years of age. gardasil 9 includes the greatest number of hpv types in any available hpv vaccine. in december 2015, the fda approved an expanded age indication for gardasil 9, to include use in males 16 through 26 years of age for the prevention of anal cancers, precancerous or dysplastic lesions and genital warts caused by certain hpv types. the company is a party to certain third-party license agreements with respect to gardasil/gardasil 9 (including a cross-license and settlement agreement with glaxosmithkline). as a result of these agreements, the company pays royalties on worldwide gardasil/gardasil 9 sales of 16% to 24% which vary by country and are included in materials and production costs.

gross margin was 65.1% in 2016 compared with 62.2% in 2015 and 60.3% in 2014. the improvement in gross margin in 2016 as compared with 2015 was driven primarily by a lower net impact from the amortization of intangible assets and purchase accounting adjustments to inventories, as well as intangible asset impairment charges and restructuring costs as noted above, which reduced gross margin by 10.6 percentage points in 2016 compared with 13.2 percentage points in 2015. lower inventory write-offs and the favorable effects of foreign exchange also contributed to the gross margin improvement in 2016 as compared with 2015. the gross margin improvement in 2015 as compared with 2014 was driven primarily by the favorable effects of foreign exchange and lower inventory write-offs, as well

as the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures. the amortization of intangible assets and purchase accounting adjustments to inventories, as well as the restructuring and intangible asset impairment charges noted above reduced gross margin by13.6 percentage points in 2014.
marketing and administrative marketing and administrative (m&a) expenses were $9.8 billion in 2016, a decline of 5% compared with 2015 driven largely by lower acquisition and divestiture-related costs, the favorable effects of foreign exchange, lower administrative expenses, such as legal defense costs, as well as lower selling costs. higher promotional spending largely related to product launches and higher restructuring costs partially offset the decline. m&a expenses were $10.3 billion in 2015, a decline of 11% compared with 2014, largely reflecting the favorable effects of foreign exchange, the 2014 divestiture of mcc, additional expenses in 2014 related to the health care reform fee as discussed below, lower restructuring costs, as well as lower selling costs, partially offset by higher promotional spending largely related to product launches, higher costs related to the january acquisition of cubist, and higher acquisition and divestiture-related costs. m&a expenses include acquisition and divestiture-related costs of $78 million, $436 million and $234 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, consisting of integration, transaction, and certain other costs related to business acquisitions, including severance costs which are not part of the company's formal restructuring programs, as well as transaction and certain other costs related to divestitures of businesses. acquisition and divestiture-related costs in 2015 include costs related to the acquisition of cubist (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). m&a expenses for 2016, 2015 and 2014 also include restructuring costs of $95 million, $78 million and $200 million, respectively, related primarily to accelerated depreciation for facilities to be closed or divested. separation costs associated with sales force reductions have been incurred and are reflected in restructuring costs as discussed below.
on july 28, 2014, the internal revenue service (irs) issued final regulations on the annual non-tax deductible health care reform fee imposed by the patient protection and affordable care act that is based on an allocation of a company's market share of prior year branded pharmaceutical sales to certain government programs. the final irs regulations accelerated the recognition criteria for the fee obligation by one year to the year in which the underlying sales used to allocate the fee occurred rather than the year in which the fee was paid. as a result of this change, merck recorded an additional year of expense of $193 million during 2014.
research and development research and development (r&d) expenses were $10.1 billion in 2016 compared with $6.7 billion in 2015. the increase was driven primarily by higher acquired in-process research and development (ipr&d) impairment charges, increased clinical development spending, higher restructuring and licensing costs, partially offset by a reduction in expenses associated with a decrease in the estimated fair value measurement of liabilities for contingent consideration, as well as by the favorable effects of foreign exchange. r&d expenses were $6.7 billion in 2015, a decline of 7% compared with 2014, driven primarily by the favorable effects of foreign exchange, expenses recognized in 2014 to increase the estimated fair value of liabilities for contingent consideration, lower restructuring costs, a charge in 2014 related to a collaboration with bayer ag (bayer), and the 2014 divestiture of mcc, partially offset by the acquisition of cubist, higher licensing costs and higher clinical development spending in 2015.
r&d expenses are comprised of the costs directly incurred by merck research laboratories (mrl), the company's research and development division that focuses on human health-related activities, which were approximately $4.3 billion in 2016, $4.0 billion in 2015 and $3.7 billion in 2014. also included in r&d expenses are costs incurred by other divisions in support of r&d activities, including depreciation, production and general and administrative, as well as licensing activity, and certain costs from operating segments, including the pharmaceutical and animal health segments, which in the aggregate were $2.5 billion, $2.6 billion and $2.8 billion for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. r&d expenses also include ipr&d impairment charges of $3.6 billion, $63 million and $49 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively (see "research and development" below). the company may recognize additional non-cash impairment charges in the future related to the cancellation or delay of other pipeline programs that were measured at fair value and capitalized in connection with business acquisitions and such charges could be material. in addition, r&d expenses include expense or income related to changes in the estimated fair value measurement of liabilities for contingent consideration recorded in connection with acquisitions. during 2016 and 2015, the company recorded a reduction in expenses of $402 million and $24 million, respectively, to decrease the estimated fair value of liabilities for contingent consideration related to the discontinuation or delay of certain programs (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). during 2014, the company recorded a charge of $316 million to
45
increase the estimated fair value of liabilities for contingent consideration. r&d expenses in 2016, 2015 and 2014 also reflect $142 million, $52 million and $283 million, respectively, of accelerated depreciation and asset abandonment costs associated with restructuring activities.
restructuring costs the company incurs substantial costs for restructuring program activities related to merck's productivity and cost reduction initiatives, as well as in connection with the integration of certain acquired businesses. in 2010 and 2013, the company commenced actions under global restructuring programs designed to streamline its cost structure. the actions under these programs include the elimination of positions in sales, administrative and headquarters organizations, as well as the sale or closure of certain manufacturing and research and development sites and the consolidation of office facilities. the company also continues to reduce its global real estate footprint and improve the efficiency of its manufacturing and supply network. the non-facility related restructuring actions under these programs are substantially complete; the remaining activities primarily relate to ongoing facility rationalizations.
restructuring costs, primarily representing separation and other related costs associated with these restructuring activities, were $651 million, $619 million and $1.0 billion in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. in 2016, 2015 and 2014, separation costs of $216 million, $208 million and $674 million, respectively, were incurred associated with actual headcount reductions, as well as estimated expenses under existing severance programs for headcount reductions that were probable and could be reasonably estimated. merck eliminated approximately 2,625 positions in 2016, 3,770 positions in 2015 and 6,085 positions in 2014 related to these restructuring activities. these position eliminations are comprised of actual headcount reductions, and the elimination of contractors and vacant positions. also included in restructuring costs are asset abandonment, shut-down and other related costs, as well as employee-related costs such as curtailment, settlement and termination charges associated with pension and other postretirement benefit plans and share-based compensation plan costs. for segment reporting, restructuring costs are unallocated expenses.
additional costs associated with the company's restructuring activities are included in materials and production, marketing and administrative and research and development as discussed above. the company recorded aggregate pretax costs of $1.1 billion in 2016, $1.1 billion in 2015 and $2.0 billion in 2014 related to restructuring program activities (see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). the company expects to substantially complete the remaining actions under the programs by the end of 2017 and incur approximately $700 million of additional pretax costs.
other (income) expense, net other (income) expense, net was $720 million of expense in 2016, $1.5 billion of expense in 2015 and $11.6 billion of income in 2014. for details on the components of other (income) expense, net, see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.

segment profits are comprised of segment sales less standard costs, certain operating expenses directly incurred by the segment, components of equity income or loss from affiliates and certain depreciation and amortization expenses. for internal management reporting presented to the chief operating decision maker, merck does not allocate materials and production costs, other than standard costs, the majority of research and development expenses or general and administrative expenses, nor the cost of financing these activities. separate divisions maintain responsibility for monitoring and managing these costs, including depreciation related to fixed assets utilized by these divisions and, therefore, they are not included in segment profits. also excluded from the determination of segment profits are acquisition and divestiture-related costs, including the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments and intangible asset impairment charges, restructuring costs, taxes paid at the joint venture level and a portion of equity income. additionally, segment profits do not reflect other expenses from corporate and manufacturing cost centers and other
46
miscellaneous income or expense. these unallocated items, including a charge related to the settlement of worldwide keytruda patent litigation, gains on divestitures, a net charge related to the settlement of vioxx shareholder class action litigation, the gain on astrazeneca's option exercise, foreign exchange losses related to the devaluation of the company's net monetary assets in venezuela, the loss on extinguishment of debt and an additional year of expense related to the health care reform fee, are reflected in "other" in the above table. also included in "other" are miscellaneous corporate profits (losses), as well as operating profits (losses) related to third-party manufacturing sales.
pharmaceutical segment profits grew 2% in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily reflecting higher sales. pharmaceutical segment profits declined 2% in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily reflecting the unfavorable effects of foreign exchange.
taxes on income the effective income tax rates of 15.4% in 2016, 17.4% in 2015 and 30.9% in 2014 reflect the impacts of acquisition and divestiture-related costs, which in 2016 include $3.6 billion of ipr&d impairment charges, as well as restructuring costs and the beneficial impact of foreign earnings. the effective income tax rate for 2015 also reflects the favorable impact of a net benefit of $410 million related to the settlement of certain federal income tax issues, the impact of the net charge related to the settlement of vioxx shareholder class action litigation being fully deductible at combined u.s. federal and state tax rates and the favorable impact of tax legislation enacted in the fourth quarter of 2015, as well as the unfavorable effect of non-tax deductible foreign exchange losses related to venezuela (see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements). the effective income tax rate for 2014 reflects the impact of the gain on the divestiture of mcc being taxed at combined u.s. federal and state tax rates. in addition, the effective income tax rate for 2014 includes a net tax benefit of $517 million recorded in connection with astrazeneca's option exercise (see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements) and a benefit of approximately $300 million associated with a capital loss generated in connection with the sale of sirna (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). the effective income tax rate for 2014 also includes the unfavorable impact of an additional year of expense for the non-tax deductible health care reform fee that the company recorded in accordance with final regulations issued by the irs.
the company is under examination by numerous tax authorities in various jurisdictions globally. the ultimate finalization of the company's examinations with relevant taxing authorities can include formal administrative and legal proceedings, which could have a significant impact on the timing of the reversal of unrecognized tax benefits. the company believes that its reserves for uncertain tax positions are adequate to cover existing risks or exposures. however, there is one item that is currently under discussion with the irs relating to the 2006 through 2008 examination. the company has concluded that its position should be sustained upon audit. however, if this item were to result in an unfavorable outcome or settlement, it could have a material adverse impact on the company's financial position, liquidity and results of operations.
net income and earnings per common share net income attributable to merck & co., inc. was $3.9 billion in 2016, $4.4 billion in 2015 and $11.9 billion in 2014. eps was $1.41 in 2016, $1.56 in 2015 and $4.07 in 2014.
non-gaap income and non-gaap eps non-gaap income and non-gaap eps are alternative views of the company's performance that merck is providing because management believes this information enhances investors' understanding of the company's results as it permits investors to understand how management assesses performance. non-gaap income and non-gaap eps exclude certain items because of the nature of these items and the impact that they have on the analysis of underlying business performance and trends. the excluded items (which should not be considered non-recurring) consist of acquisition and divestiture-related costs, restructuring costs and certain other items. these excluded items are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance.
non-gaap income and non-gaap eps are important internal measures for the company. senior management receives a monthly analysis of operating results that includes non-gaap eps. management uses these measures internally for planning and forecasting purposes and to measure the performance of the company along with other metrics. senior management's annual compensation is derived in part using non-gaap income and non-gaap eps. since non-gaap income and non-gaap eps are not measures determined in accordance with gaap, they have no standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and, therefore, may not be comparable to the calculation of
47
similar measures of other companies. the information on non-gaap income and non-gaap eps should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, net income and eps prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states (gaap).
a reconciliation between gaap financial measures and non-gaap financial measures is as follows:

acquisition and divestiture-related costs non-gaap income and non-gaap eps exclude the impact of certain amounts recorded in connection with business acquisitions and divestitures. these amounts include the amortization of intangible assets and amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to inventories, as well as intangible asset impairment charges and expense or income related to changes in the estimated fair value measurement of contingent consideration. also excluded are integration, transaction, and certain other costs associated with business acquisitions, including severance costs which are not part
48
of the company's formal restructuring programs, as well as transaction and certain other costs associated with divestitures of businesses.
restructuring costs non-gaap income and non-gaap eps exclude costs related to restructuring actions (see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). these amounts include employee separation costs and accelerated depreciation associated with facilities to be closed or divested. accelerated depreciation costs represent the difference between the depreciation expense to be recognized over the revised useful life of the asset, based upon the anticipated date the site will be closed or divested or the equipment disposed of, and depreciation expense as determined utilizing the useful life prior to the restructuring actions. restructuring costs also include asset abandonment, shut-down and other related costs, as well as employee-related costs such as curtailment, settlement and termination charges associated with pension and other postretirement benefit plans and share-based compensation costs.
certain other items non-gaap income and non-gaap eps exclude certain other items. these items are adjusted for after evaluating them on an individual basis, considering their quantitative and qualitative aspects, and typically consist of items that are unusual in nature, significant to the results of a particular period or not indicative of future operating results. excluded from non-gaap income and non-gaap eps in 2016 is a charge to settle worldwide patent litigation related to keytruda (see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements). excluded from non-gaap income and non-gaap eps in 2015 are foreign exchange losses related to the devaluation of the company's net monetary assets in venezuela (see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements), a net charge related to the settlement of vioxx shareholder class action litigation (see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements), a gain on the sale of certain migraine clinical development programs (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements), a gain on the divestiture of the company's remaining ophthalmics business in international markets (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements), as well as a net tax benefit related to the settlement of certain federal income tax issues (see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements). excluded from non-gaap income and non-gaap eps in 2014 are certain gains, including a gain on the divestiture of mcc (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements), a gain recognized in conjunction with astrazeneca's option exercise, including a related net tax benefit on the transaction (see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements), a gain on the divestiture of certain ophthalmic products in several international markets (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements), as well as a loss on extinguishment of debt (see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements), an additional year of expense related to the health care reform fee as discussed above, and tax benefits from the sale of the company's sirna therapeutics, inc. (sirna) subsidiary (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements).
research and development a chart reflecting the company's current research pipeline as of february 24, 2017 is set forth in item 1. "business - research and development" above.
research and development update the company currently has several candidates under regulatory review in the united states.
keytruda is an fda-approved anti-pd-1 therapy in clinical development for expanded indications in different cancer types. keytruda is currently approved for the treatment of nsclc, melanoma, advanced melanoma, and head and neck cancer (see "pharmaceutical segment" above).
in february 2017, the fda accepted for review two sblas for keytruda in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer, including most bladder cancers. the application for first-line use was granted priority review for the treatment of these patients who are ineligible for cisplatin-containing therapy. the application for second-line use was granted priority review for these patients with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. the prescription drug user fee act (pdufa) action date for both applications is june 14, 2017. the fda previously granted breakthrough therapy designation to keytruda for the second-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy.
in january 2017, the fda accepted for review an sbla for keytruda plus chemotherapy (pemetrexed plus carboplatin) for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic or advanced non-squamous nsclc regardless of
49
pd-l1 expression and with no egfr or alk genomic tumor aberrations. this is the first application for regulatory approval of keytruda in combination with another treatment. the fda granted priority review with a pdufa action date of may 10, 2017. the sbla will be reviewed under the fda's accelerated approval program.
in december 2016, the fda accepted for review an sbla for keytruda for the treatment of patients with refractory classical hodgkin lymphoma or for patients who have relapsed after three or more prior lines of therapy. the fda granted priority review with a pdufa action date of march 15, 2017. the sbla will be reviewed under the fda's accelerated approval program.
in november 2016, the fda accepted for review an sbla for keytruda for the treatment of previously treated patients with advanced microsatellite instability-high (msi-h) cancer. the fda granted priority review with a pdufa action date of march 8, 2017. the sbla will be reviewed under the fda's accelerated approval program. the fda recently granted breakthrough therapy designation to keytruda for unresectable or metastatic msi-h non-colorectal cancer, and previously granted it for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic msi-h colorectal cancer.
additionally, keytruda has also received breakthrough therapy designation from the fda for the treatment of patients with primary mediastinal b-cell lymphoma that is refractory to or has relapsed after two prior lines of therapy.
the fda's breakthrough therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of a candidate that is planned for use, alone or in combination, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition when preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints.
the keytruda clinical development program consists of more than 400 clinical trials, including more than 200 trials that combine keytruda with other cancer treatments. these studies encompass more than 30 cancer types including: bladder, colorectal, esophageal, gastric, head and neck, hepatocellular, hodgkin lymphoma, non-hodgkin lymphoma, melanoma, multiple myeloma, nasopharyngeal, nsclc, ovarian, prostate, renal and triple-negative breast, many of which are currently in phase 3 clinical development. further trials are being planned for other cancers.
mk-1293 is an investigational follow-on biologic insulin glargine candidate for the treatment of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes under review by the fda. mk-1293 was approved in the eu in january 2017. mk-1293 is being developed in collaboration with and partially funded by samsung bioepis.

in addition to the candidates under regulatory review, the company has several drug candidates in phase 3 clinical development in addition to the keytruda programs discussed above.
mk-8931, verubecestat, is an investigational small molecule inhibitor of the beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (bace1) for the treatment of alzheimer's disease. in february 2017, merck announced that its external data monitoring committee (edmc) recommended termination of the phase 2/3 epoch study of verubecestat in mild-to-moderate alzheimer's disease based on the low probability of success of this study. the same edmc recommended that a separate phase 3 study, apecs, evaluating verubecestat for amnestic mild cognitive impairment due to alzheimer's disease, also known as prodromal alzheimer's disease, continue as planned. estimated primary completion date for the apecs study, which is fully enrolled, is february 2019.
mk-0859, anacetrapib, is an investigational inhibitor of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (cetp) in development for raising hdl-c and reducing ldl-c. anacetrapib is being evaluated in a 30,000 patient, event-driven cardiovascular clinical outcomes trial sponsored by oxford university, reveal (randomized evaluation of the effects of anacetrapib through lipid-modification), involving patients with preexisting vascular disease. in november
50
2015, merck announced that the data monitoring committee (dmc) of the reveal outcomes study completed its planned review of unblinded study data and recommended the study continue with no changes. the dmc reviewed safety and efficacy data from the study, which included an assessment of futility. merck remains blinded to the actual results of this analysis and to other reveal safety and efficacy data. under the study, the last patient's last visit occurred in january 2017. the company anticipates receiving the top-line results from the study mid-year 2017.
mk-7655a is a combination of relebactam, an investigational beta-lactamase inhibitor, and imipenem/cilastatin (an approved carbapenem antibiotic). the fda has designated this combination a qualified infectious disease product with designated fast track status for the treatment of hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia, ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia, complicated intra-abdominal infections and complicated urinary tract infections.
mk-8228, letermovir, is an investigational oral once-daily or an intravenous infusion antiviral candidate for the prevention of clinically-significant cytomegalovirus (cmv) infection. letermovir has received orphan drug status in the eu and in the united states, where it has also been granted fast track designation. in october 2016, merck announced that the pivotal phase 3 clinical study of letermovir met its primary endpoint. the global, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study evaluated the efficacy and safety of letermovir in adult (18 years and older) cmv-seropositive recipients of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. merck plans to submit regulatory applications for the approval of letermovir in the united states and eu in 2017.
mk-8835, ertugliflozin, is an investigational oral sglt2 inhibitor being evaluated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in collaboration with pfizer inc. (pfizer). in september 2016, merck and pfizer announced that a phase 3 study (vertis sita2) of ertugliflozin met its primary endpoint. both 5 mg and 15 mg daily doses of ertugliflozin showed significantly greater reductions in a1c (an average measure of blood glucose over the past two to three months) when added to patients on a background of sitagliptin and metformin. ertugliflozin is also being studied in combination with januvia (sitagliptin) and metformin. in december 2016, merck submitted new drug applications to the fda for ertugliflozin and the two fixed-dose combinations: mk-8835a, ertugliflozin plus januvia, and mk-8835b, ertugliflozin plus metformin. the company anticipates a response from the fda in the first quarter of 2017. ertugliflozin and the two fixed-dose combinations are currently under review in the eu. under the terms of the collaboration agreement with pfizer, merck will make a $90 million milestone payment to pfizer in 2017.
mk-0431j is an investigational fixed-dose combination of sitagliptin and ipragliflozin under development for commercialization in japan in collaboration with astellas pharma inc. (astellas). ipragliflozin, an sglt2 inhibitor, co-developed by astellas and kotobuki pharmaceutical co., ltd. (kotobuki), is approved for use in japan and is being co-promoted with merck and kotobuki.
v920 is an investigational rvsv-zebov (ebola) vaccine candidate being studied in large scale phase 2/3 clinical trials. in november 2014, merck and newlink genetics announced an exclusive licensing and collaboration agreement for the investigational ebola vaccine. in december 2015, merck announced that the application for emergency use assessment and listing (eual) for v920 was accepted for review by the world health organization (who). according to the who, the eual process is designed to expedite the availability of vaccines needed for public health emergencies such as another outbreak of ebola. the decision to grant v920 eual status will be based on data regarding quality, safety, and efficacy/effectiveness; as well as a risk/benefit analysis for emergency use. while eual designation allows for emergency use, the vaccine remains investigational and has not yet been licensed for commercial distribution. in july 2016, merck announced that the fda granted v920 breakthrough therapy designation, and that the ema granted the vaccine candidate prime (priority medicines) status. in december 2016, end of study results from the who ring vaccination trial were reported in lancet supporting the july 2015 interim assessment that v920 offers substantial protection against ebola virus disease, with no reported cases among vaccinated individuals from 10 days after vaccination in both randomized and non-randomized clusters. results from other ongoing studies are anticipated in the second half of 2017.
mk-1242, vericiguat, is an investigational treatment for heart failure being studied in a phase 3 clinical trial in patients suffering from chronic heart failure. the development of vericiguat is part of a worldwide strategic collaboration between merck and bayer (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements).
v212 is an inactivated varicella zoster virus vaccine in development for the prevention of herpes zoster. the company completed the phase 3 trial in autologous hematopoietic cell transplant patients and is conducting another phase 3 trial in patients with solid tumor malignancies undergoing chemotherapy and hematological malignancies. the
51
study in autologous hematopoietic cell transplant patients met its primary endpoints and merck presented the results from this study at the american society for blood and marrow transplantation meetings in february 2017.
mk-1439, doravirine, is an investigational non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor being developed by merck for the treatment of hiv-1 infection. in february 2017, the company received positive results from a first phase 3 study showing that doravirine was non-inferior to an alternative regimen in achieving and maintaining hiv-1 suppression in infected adults during 48 weeks of treatment.
in 2016, the company also divested or discontinued certain drug candidates.
merck announced that it is discontinuing the development of odanacatib, an investigational cathepsin k inhibitor for osteoporosis, and will not seek regulatory approval for its use. merck previously reported a numeric imbalance in adjudicated stroke events in the pivotal phase 3 fracture outcomes study in postmenopausal women. the company has decided to discontinue development after an independent adjudication and analysis of major adverse cardiovascular events confirmed an increased risk of stroke.
the company determined that, for business reasons, it would terminate the north america partnership agreement with alk-abelló that included mk-8237, an investigational allergy immunotherapy tablet for house dust mite allergy. merck has given alk-abelló six months' notice that it is terminating the agreement and therefore this compound will be returned to alk-abelló. this decision was not due to efficacy or safety concerns. in connection with the decision, the company recorded an ipr&d impairment charge (see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements).
the company also decided, for business reasons, to discontinue the clinical development of mk-8342b, referred to as the next generation ring, an investigational combination (etonogestrel and 17ß-estradiol) vaginal ring for contraception and the treatment of dysmenorrhea in women seeking contraception. this decision was not due to efficacy or safety concerns. as a result of this decision, the company recorded an ipr&d impairment charge (see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements).
merck announced that, for business reasons, it will not proceed with submitting marketing applications for omarigliptin, an investigational, once-weekly dpp-4 inhibitor, in the united states or europe. this decision did not result from concerns about the efficacy or safety of omarigliptin.
the company maintains a number of long-term exploratory and fundamental research programs in biology and chemistry as well as research programs directed toward product development. the company's research and development model is designed to increase productivity and improve the probability of success by prioritizing the company's research and development resources on candidates the company believes are capable of providing unambiguous, promotable advantages to patients and payers and delivering the maximum value of its approved medicines and vaccines through new indications and new formulations. merck is pursuing emerging product opportunities independent of therapeutic area or modality (small molecule, biologics and vaccines) and is building its biologics capabilities. the company is committed to making externally sourced programs a greater component of its pipeline strategy, with a focus on supplementing its internal research with a licensing and external alliance strategy focused on the entire spectrum of collaborations from early research to late-stage compounds, as well as access to new technologies.
the company also reviews its pipeline to examine candidates which may provide more value through out-licensing. the company continues to evaluate certain late-stage clinical development and platform technology assets to determine their out-licensing or sale potential.
the company's clinical pipeline includes candidates in multiple disease areas, including atherosclerosis, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, infectious diseases, inflammatory/autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and respiratory diseases.
acquired in-process research and development in connection with business acquisitions, the company has recorded the fair value of in-process research projects which, at the time of acquisition, had not yet reached technological feasibility. at december 31, 2016, the balance of ipr&d was $1.7 billion. during 2016, the company recorded ipr&d for projects obtained in connection with the acquisitions of afferent and iomet as discussed below.
52
during 2016, 2015 and 2014, $8 million, $280 million and $654 million, respectively, of ipr&d projects received marketing approval in a major market and the company began amortizing these assets based on their estimated useful lives.
all of the ipr&d projects that remain in development are subject to the inherent risks and uncertainties in drug development and it is possible that the company will not be able to successfully develop and complete the ipr&d programs and profitably commercialize the underlying product candidates. the time periods to receive approvals from the fda and other regulatory agencies are subject to uncertainty. significant delays in the approval process, or the company's failure to obtain approval at all, would delay or prevent the company from realizing revenues from these products. additionally, if certain of the ipr&d programs fail or are abandoned during development, then the company will not realize the future cash flows it has estimated and recorded as ipr&d as of the acquisition date, and the company may also not recover the research and development expenditures made since the acquisition to further develop such program. if such circumstances were to occur, the company's future operating results could be adversely affected and the company may recognize impairment charges and such charges could be material.
during 2016, the company recorded $3.6 billion of ipr&d impairment charges within research and development expenses. of this amount, $2.9 billion relates to the clinical development program for uprifosbuvir, a nucleotide prodrug in clinical development being evaluated for the treatment of hcv. the company determined that recent changes to the product profile, as well as changes to merck's expectations for pricing and the market opportunity, taken together constituted a triggering event that required the company to evaluate the uprifosbuvir intangible asset for impairment. utilizing market participant assumptions, and considering different scenarios, the company concluded that its best estimate of the current fair value of the intangible asset related to uprifosbuvir was $240 million, resulting in the recognition of the pretax impairment charge noted above. the ipr&d impairment charges in 2016 also include charges of $180 million and $143 million related to the discontinuation of programs obtained in connection with the acquisitions of ccam biotherapeutics ltd. and oncoethix, respectively, resulting from unfavorable efficacy data. an additional $72 million relates to programs obtained in connection with the smartcells acquisition following a decision to terminate the lead compound due to a lack of efficacy and to pursue a back-up compound which reduced projected future cash flows. the ipr&d impairment charges in 2016 also include $112 million related to an in-licensed program for house dust mite allergies that, for business reasons, will be returned to the licensor. the remaining ipr&d impairment charges for 2016 primarily relate to deprioritized pipeline programs that were deemed to have no alternative use during the period, including a $79 million impairment charge for an investigational candidate for contraception. the discontinuation or delay of certain of these clinical development programs resulted in a reduction of the related liabilities for contingent consideration (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements).
during 2015, the company recorded $63 million of ipr&d impairment charges, of which $50 million related to the surotomycin clinical development program. during 2015, the company received unfavorable efficacy data from a clinical trial for surotomycin. the evaluation of this data, combined with an assessment of the commercial opportunity for surotomycin, resulted in the discontinuation of the program and the ipr&d impairment charge noted above.
during 2014, the company recorded $49 million of ipr&d impairment charges primarily as a result of changes in cash flow assumptions for certain compounds obtained in connection with the company's joint venture with supera farma laboratorios s.a., as well as for the discontinuation of certain animal health programs.
additional research and development will be required before any of the remaining programs reach technological feasibility. the costs to complete the research projects will depend on whether the projects are brought to their final stages of development and are ultimately submitted to the fda or other regulatory agencies for approval. as of december 31, 2016, the estimated costs to complete projects acquired in connection with acquisitions in phase 3 development for human health were approximately $290 million.
acquisitions, research collaborations and license agreements merck continues to remain focused on pursuing opportunities that have the potential to drive both near- and long-term growth. certain of the more recent significant transactions are described below. merck is actively monitoring the landscape for growth opportunities that meet the company's strategic criteria.
in july 2016, merck acquired afferent, a privately held pharmaceutical company focused on the development of therapeutic candidates targeting the p2x3 receptor for the treatment of common, poorly-managed, neurogenic
53
conditions. afferent's lead investigational candidate, mk-7264 (formerly af-219), is a selective, non-narcotic, orally-administered p2x3 antagonist being evaluated in a phase 2b clinical trial for the treatment of refractory, chronic cough as well as in a phase 2 clinical trial in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with cough. total consideration transferred of $510 million included cash paid for outstanding afferent shares of $487 million, as well as share-based compensation payments to settle equity awards attributable to precombination service and cash paid for transaction costs on behalf of afferent. in addition, former afferent shareholders are eligible to receive a total of up to an additional $750 million contingent upon the attainment of certain clinical development and commercial milestones for multiple indications and candidates, including mk-7264. this transaction was accounted for as an acquisition of a business; accordingly, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. the company determined the fair value of the contingent consideration was $223 million at the acquisition date utilizing a probability-weighted estimated cash flow stream adjusted for the expected timing of each payment using an appropriate discount rate dependent on the nature and timing of the milestone payment. merck recognized an intangible asset for ipr&d of $832 million, net deferred tax liabilities of $258 million, and other net assets of $29 million (primarily consisting of cash acquired). the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets acquired of $130 million was recorded as goodwill that was allocated to the pharmaceutical segment and is not deductible for tax purposes. the fair value of the identifiable intangible asset related to ipr&d was determined using an income approach, through which fair value is estimated based upon the asset's probability-adjusted future net cash flows, which reflects the stage of development of the project and the associated probability of successful completion. the net cash flows were then discounted to present value using a discount rate of 11.5%. actual cash flows are likely to be different than those assumed.
in june 2016, merck and moderna entered into a strategic collaboration and license agreement to develop and commercialize novel mrna-based personalized cancer vaccines. the development program will entail multiple studies in several types of cancer and include the evaluation of mrna-based personalized cancer vaccines in combination with merck's keytruda. pursuant to the terms of the agreement, merck made an upfront cash payment to moderna of $200 million, which was recorded in research and development expenses. following human proof of concept studies, merck has the right to elect to make an additional payment to moderna. if merck exercises this right, the two companies will then equally share cost and profits under a worldwide collaboration for the development of personalized cancer vaccines. moderna will have the right to elect to co-promote the personalized cancer vaccines in the united states. the agreement entails exclusivity around combinations with keytruda. moderna and merck will each have the ability to combine mrna-based personalized cancer vaccines with other (non-pd-1) agents.
in january 2016, merck acquired iomet, a privately held uk-based drug discovery company focused on the development of innovative medicines for the treatment of cancer, with a particular emphasis on the fields of cancer immunotherapy and cancer metabolism. the acquisition provides merck with iomet's preclinical pipeline of ido (indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1), tdo (tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase), and dual-acting ido/tdo inhibitors. the transaction was accounted for as an acquisition of a business. total purchase consideration in the transaction included a cash payment of $150 million and future additional milestone payments of up to $250 million that are contingent upon certain clinical and regulatory milestones being achieved. the company determined the fair value of the contingent consideration was $94 million at the acquisition date utilizing a probability-weighted estimated cash flow stream adjusted for the expected timing of each payment utilizing a discount rate of 10.5%. merck recognized intangible assets for ipr&d of $155 million and net deferred tax assets of $32 million. the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets acquired of $57 million was recorded as goodwill that was allocated to the pharmaceutical segment and is not deductible for tax purposes. the fair values of the identifiable intangible assets related to ipr&d were determined using an income approach. the assets' probability-adjusted future net cash flows were then discounted to present value also using a discount rate of 10.5%. actual cash flows are likely to be different than those assumed.
selected joint venture and affiliate information sanofi pasteur msd on december 31, 2016, merck and sanofi terminated the equally-owned joint venture formed in 1994 to develop and market vaccines in europe (see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements).

astrazeneca lp on june 30, 2014, astrazeneca exercised an option that resulted in the redemption of merck's remaining interest in astrazeneca lp (azlp), the partnership between merck and astrazeneca, for $419 million in cash (see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements). of this amount, $327 million reflected an estimate of the fair value of merck's interest in nexium and prilosec (products sold by azlp). this portion of the exercise price, which is subject to a true-up in 2018 based on actual sales from closing in 2014 to june 2018, was deferred and recognized as income of $5 million, $182 million and $140 million, during 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, in other (income) expense, net as the contingency was eliminated as sales occurred. once the deferred income amount was fully amortized, in the first quarter of 2016, the company began recognizing income and a corresponding receivable for amounts that will be due to merck from astrazeneca based on the sales performance of nexium and prilosec subject to the true-up in june 2018. the company recognized $93 million of such income in 2016 included in other (income) expense, net.
the remaining exercise price of $91 million primarily represents a multiple of ten times merck's average 1% annual profit allocation in the partnership for the three years prior to exercise. merck recognized the $91 million as a gain in 2014 within other (income) expense, net. the company also recognized a non-cash gain of approximately $650 million in 2014 within other (income) expense, net resulting from the retirement of $2.4 billion of preferred stock, the elimination of the company's $1.4 billion investment in azlp and a $340 million reduction of goodwill. this transaction resulted in a net tax benefit of $517 million in 2014 primarily reflecting the reversal of deferred taxes on the azlp investment balance.
in 2014, prior to termination, merck recorded revenue from azlp of $463 million and earned partnership returns of $192 million, which were recorded in equity income from affiliates included in other (income) expense, net.
capital expenditures capital expenditures were $1.6 billion in 2016, $1.3 billion in 2015 and $1.3 billion in 2014. expenditures in the united states were $1.0 billion in 2016, $879 million in 2015 and $873 million in 2014.
depreciation expense was $1.6 billion in 2016, $1.6 billion in 2015 and $2.5 billion in 2014 of which $1.0 billion, $1.1 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, applied to locations in the united states. total depreciation expense in 2016, 2015 and 2014 included accelerated depreciation of $227 million, $174 million and $900 million, respectively, associated with restructuring activities (see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).
analysis of liquidity and capital resources merck's strong financial profile enables it to fund research and development, focus on external alliances, support in-line products and maximize upcoming launches while providing significant cash returns to shareholders.

cash provided by operating activities was $10.4 billion in 2016, $12.5 billion in 2015 and $8.0 billion in 2014. cash provided by operating activities in 2016 reflects a net payment of approximately $680 million to fund the
55
vioxx shareholder class action litigation settlement not covered by insurance proceeds (see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements). cash provided by operating activities in 2014 reflects approximately $5.0 billion of taxes paid on the divestiture of mcc. cash provided by operating activities continues to be the company's primary source of funds to finance operating needs, capital expenditures, a portion of treasury stock purchases and dividends paid to shareholders.
cash used in investing activities was $3.2 billion in 2016 compared with $4.8 billion in 2015. the lower use of cash in 2016 was driven primarily by cash used in 2015 for the acquisition of cubist, as well as lower purchases of securities and other investments in 2016, partially offset by lower proceeds from the sales of securities and other investments in 2016 and the use of cash in 2016 for the acquisitions of afferent and staywell. cash used in investing activities was $4.8 billion in 2015 compared with $374 million in 2014 primarily reflecting cash received in 2014 from the divestiture of mcc, higher cash received in 2014 from other dispositions of businesses and in connection with astrazeneca's option exercise, as well as cash used for the acquisition of cubist in 2015, partially offset by lower purchases of securities and other investments, higher proceeds from the sales of securities and other investments, cash used in 2014 for the acquisition of idenix, and a cash payment made in 2014 upon the formation of the collaboration with bayer.
cash used in financing activities was $9.0 billion in 2016 compared with $5.4 billion in 2015 driven primarily by lower proceeds from the issuance of debt, partially offset by a decrease in short-term borrowings in the prior year, lower payments on debt, lower purchases of treasury stock and higher proceeds from the exercise of stock options. cash used in financing activities was $5.4 billion in 2015 compared with $15.2 billion in 2014 driven primarily by higher proceeds from the issuance of debt, lower payments on debt and lower purchases of treasury stock, partially offset by lower proceeds from the exercise of stock options and a decrease in short-term borrowings.
during 2015, the company recorded charges of $876 million related to the devaluation of its net monetary assets in venezuela, the large majority of which was cash (see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements).
at december 31, 2016, the total of worldwide cash and investments was $25.8 billion, including $14.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and $11.4 billion of long-term investments. generally 80%-90% of cash and investments are held by foreign subsidiaries and would be subject to significant tax payments if such cash and investments were repatriated in the form of dividends. the company records u.s. deferred tax liabilities for certain unremitted earnings, but when amounts earned overseas are expected to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states, no accrual for u.s. taxes is provided. the amount of cash and investments held by u.s. and foreign subsidiaries fluctuates due to a variety of factors including the timing and receipt of payments in the normal course of business. cash provided by operating activities in the united states continues to be the company's primary source of funds to finance domestic operating needs, capital expenditures, a portion of treasury stock purchases and dividends paid to shareholders.

purchase obligations are enforceable and legally binding obligations for purchases of goods and services including minimum inventory contracts, research and development and advertising. amounts reflected for research and development obligations do not include contingent milestone payments. in 2017, the company will make a $90 million milestone payment in connection with a clinical program being developed in a collaboration (see "research and development" above). also excluded from research and development obligations are potential future funding commitments of up to approximately $90 million for investments in research venture capital funds. loans payable and current portion of long-term debt reflects $267 million of long-dated notes that are subject to repayment at the option of the holders. required funding obligations for 2017 relating to the company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans are not expected to be material. however, the company currently anticipates contributing approximately $50 million to its u.s. pension plans, $160 million to its international pension plans and $25 million to its other postretirement benefit plans during 2017.
in november 2016, the company issued €1.0 billion principal amount of senior unsecured notes consisting of €500 million principal amount of 0.50% notes due 2024 and €500 million principal amount of 1.375% notes due 2036. the company intends to use the net proceeds of the offering of $1.1 billion for general corporate purposes, including without limitation, the repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings and other indebtedness with upcoming maturities.
in june 2016, the company terminated its existing credit facility and entered into a new $6.0 billion, five-year credit facility that matures in june 2021. the facility provides backup liquidity for the company's commercial paper borrowing facility and is to be used for general corporate purposes. the company has not drawn funding from this facility.
in december 2015, the company filed a securities registration statement with the u.s. securities and exchange commission (sec) under the automatic shelf registration process available to "well-known seasoned issuers" which is effective for three years.
in february 2015, merck issued $8.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes. the company used a portion of the net proceeds of the offering of $7.9 billion to repay commercial paper issued to substantially finance the company's acquisition of cubist. the remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including for repurchases of the company's common stock, and the repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings and debt maturities.
also in february 2015, the company redeemed $1.9 billion of legacy cubist debt acquired in the acquisition (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements).
in october 2014, the company issued €2.5 billion principal amount of senior unsecured notes. the net proceeds of the offering of $3.1 billion were used in part to repay debt that was validly tendered in connection with tender offers launched by the company for certain outstanding notes and debentures. the company paid $2.5 billion in aggregate consideration (applicable purchase price together with accrued interest) to redeem $1.8 billion principal amount of debt. in november 2014, merck redeemed an additional $2.0 billion principal amount of senior unsecured notes.
effective as of november 3, 2009, the company executed a full and unconditional guarantee of the then existing debt of its subsidiary merck sharp & dohme corp. (msd) and msd executed a full and unconditional guarantee of the then existing debt of the company (excluding commercial paper), including for payments of principal and interest. these guarantees do not extend to debt issued subsequent to that date.
the company continues to maintain a conservative financial profile. the company places its cash and investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in its investment policy guidelines. these guidelines also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. the company does not participate in any off-balance sheet arrangements involving unconsolidated subsidiaries that provide financing or potentially expose the company to unrecorded financial obligations.

in open-market transactions, block transactions, on or off an exchange, or in privately negotiated transactions. the company purchased $3.4 billion of its common stock (60 million shares) for its treasury during 2016. the company has approximately $5.1 billion remaining under the march share repurchase program. the company purchased $4.2 billion and $7.7 billion of its common stock during 2015 and 2014, respectively, under this and previously authorized share repurchase programs.
financial instruments market risk disclosures the company manages the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on its earnings, cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities through operational means and through the use of various financial instruments, including derivative instruments.
a significant portion of the company's revenues and earnings in foreign affiliates is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. the objectives and accounting related to the company's foreign currency risk management program, as well as its interest rate risk management activities are discussed below.
foreign currency risk management the company has established revenue hedging, balance sheet risk management, and net investment hedging programs to protect against volatility of future foreign currency cash flows and changes in fair value caused by volatility in foreign exchange rates.
the objective of the revenue hedging program is to reduce the variability caused by changes in foreign exchange rates that would affect the u.s. dollar value of future cash flows derived from foreign currency denominated sales, primarily the euro and japanese yen. to achieve this objective, the company will hedge a portion of its forecasted foreign currency denominated third-party and intercompany distributor entity sales (forecasted sales) that are expected to occur over its planning cycle, typically no more than two years into the future. the company will layer in hedges over time, increasing the portion of forecasted sales hedged as it gets closer to the expected date of the forecasted foreign currency denominated sales. the portion of forecasted sales hedged is based on assessments of cost-benefit profiles that consider natural offsetting exposures, revenue and exchange rate volatilities and correlations, and the cost of hedging instruments. the company manages its anticipated transaction exposure principally with purchased local currency put options, forward contracts, and purchased collar options.
because merck principally sells foreign currency in its revenue hedging program, a uniform weakening of the u.s. dollar would yield the largest overall potential loss in the market value of these hedge instruments. the market value of merck's hedges would have declined by an estimated $538 million and $502 million at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, from a uniform 10% weakening of the u.s. dollar. the market value was determined using a foreign exchange option pricing model and holding all factors except exchange rates constant. although not predictive in nature, the company believes that a 10% threshold reflects reasonably possible near-term changes in merck's major foreign currency exposures relative to the u.s. dollar. the cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
the company manages operating activities and net asset positions at the local level in order to mitigate the effect of exchange on monetary assets and liabilities. the company also uses a balance sheet risk management program to mitigate the exposure of net monetary assets that are denominated in a currency other than a subsidiary's functional currency from the effects of volatility in foreign exchange. in these instances, merck principally utilizes forward exchange contracts to offset the effects of exchange on exposures denominated in developed country currencies, primarily the euro and japanese yen. for exposures in developing country currencies, the company will enter into forward contracts to partially offset the effects of exchange on exposures when it is deemed economical to do so based on a cost-benefit analysis that considers the magnitude of the exposure, the volatility of the exchange rate and the cost of the hedging instrument. the cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
a sensitivity analysis to changes in the value of the u.s. dollar on foreign currency denominated derivatives, investments and monetary assets and liabilities indicated that if the u.s. dollar uniformly weakened by 10% against all currency exposures of the company at december 31, 2016, income before taxes would have declined by approximately $26 million in 2016. because the company was in a net short (payable) position relative to its major foreign currencies after consideration of forward contracts, a uniform weakening of the u.s. dollar will yield the largest overall potential net loss in earnings due to exchange. at december 31, 2015, the company was in a net long (receivable)
58
position relative to its major foreign currencies after consideration of forward contracts, therefore a uniform 10% strengthening of the u.s. dollar would have reduced income before taxes by approximately $45 million. this measurement assumes that a change in one foreign currency relative to the u.s. dollar would not affect other foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar. although not predictive in nature, the company believes that a 10% threshold reflects reasonably possible near-term changes in merck's major foreign currency exposures relative to the u.s. dollar. the cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
since january 2010, venezuela has been designated hyperinflationary and, as a result, local foreign operations are remeasured in u.s. dollars with the impact recorded in results of operations. in 2015, the venezuelan government identified multiple exchange rates, which included the cencoex rate (6.3 vef per u.s. dollar) and the simadi rate. while the venezuelan government had indicated that essential goods, including food and medicine, would remain at the cencoex rate, during the second quarter of 2015, upon evaluation of evolving economic conditions in venezuela and volatility in the country, combined with a decline in transactions that were settled at the cencoex rate, the company determined it was unlikely that all outstanding net monetary assets would be settled at the cencoex rate. accordingly, during the second quarter of 2015, the company recorded a charge of $715 million within other (income) expense, net to devalue its net monetary assets in venezuela to an amount that represented the company's estimate of the u.s. dollar amount that would ultimately be collected. during the third quarter of 2015, the company recorded additional exchange losses of $138 million in the aggregate reflecting the ongoing effect of translating transactions and net monetary assets consistent with the second quarter. as a result of the further deterioration of economic conditions in venezuela and continued declines in transactions which were settled at the cencoex rate (subsequently replaced by the dipro rate), in the fourth quarter of 2015, the company began using the simadi rate, which was 198.70 vef per u.s. at december 31, 2015, to report its venezuelan operations. the company also revalued its remaining net monetary assets at the simadi rate (subsequently replaced with the dicom rate), which resulted in an additional charge in the fourth quarter of 2015 of $161 million.
the company may also use forward exchange contracts to hedge its net investment in foreign operations against movements in exchange rates. the forward contracts are designated as hedges of the net investment in a foreign operation. the company hedges a portion of the net investment in certain of its foreign operations and measures ineffectiveness based upon changes in spot foreign exchange rates that are recorded in other (income) expense, net. the effective portion of the unrealized gains or losses on these contracts is recorded in foreign currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive income (oci), and remains in accumulated other comprehensive income (aoci) until either the sale or complete or substantially complete liquidation of the subsidiary. the cash flows from these contracts are reported as investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency debt. the company's senior unsecured euro-denominated notes have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of the net investment in a foreign operation. accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments are included in foreign currency translation adjustment within oci.
interest rate risk management the company may use interest rate swap contracts on certain investing and borrowing transactions to manage its net exposure to interest rate changes and to reduce its overall cost of borrowing. the company does not use leveraged swaps and, in general, does not leverage any of its investment activities that would put principal capital at risk.
in may 2016, four interest rate swaps with notional amounts of $250 million each matured. these swaps effectively converted the company's $1.0 billion, 0.70% fixed-rate notes due 2016 to variable rate debt. at december 31, 2016, the company was a party to 26 pay-floating, receive-fixed interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges of fixed-rate notes in which the notional amounts match the amount of the hedged fixed-rate notes as detailed in the table below.

the interest rate swap contracts are designated hedges of the fair value changes in the notes attributable to changes in the benchmark london interbank offered rate (libor) swap rate. the fair value changes in the notes attributable to changes in the libor swap rate are recorded in interest expense and offset by the fair value changes in the swap contracts. the cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
the company's investment portfolio includes cash equivalents and short-term investments, the market values of which are not significantly affected by changes in interest rates. the market value of the company's medium- to long-term fixed-rate investments is modestly affected by changes in u.s. interest rates. changes in medium- to long-term u.s. interest rates have a more significant impact on the market value of the company's fixed-rate borrowings, which generally have longer maturities. a sensitivity analysis to measure potential changes in the market value of merck's investments and debt from a change in interest rates indicated that a one percentage point increase in interest rates at december 31, 2016 and 2015 would have positively affected the net aggregate market value of these instruments by $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. a one percentage point decrease at december 31, 2016 and 2015 would have negatively affected the net aggregate market value by $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. the fair value of merck's debt was determined using pricing models reflecting one percentage point shifts in the appropriate yield curves. the fair values of merck's investments were determined using a combination of pricing and duration models.
critical accounting policies the company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap and, accordingly, include certain amounts that are based on management's best estimates and judgments. estimates are used when accounting for amounts recorded in connection with acquisitions, including initial fair value determinations of assets and liabilities, primarily ipr&d, other intangible assets and contingent consideration, as well as subsequent fair value measurements. additionally, estimates are used in determining such items as provisions for sales discounts and returns, depreciable and amortizable lives, recoverability of inventories, including those produced in preparation for product launches, amounts recorded for contingencies, environmental liabilities and other reserves, pension and other postretirement benefit plan assumptions, share-based compensation assumptions, restructuring costs, impairments of long-lived assets (including intangible assets and goodwill) and investments, and taxes on income. because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. application of the following accounting policies result in accounting estimates having the potential for the most significant impact on the financial statements.
acquisitions to determine whether acquisitions qualify as business combinations or asset acquisitions, the company makes certain judgments, which include assessment of the inputs, processes, and outputs associated with the acquired set of activities. on october 1, 2016, the company adopted new accounting guidance intended to clarify whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. if the company determines that substantially all of the fair value of gross assets included in a transaction is concentrated in a single asset (or a group of similar assets), the assets would not represent a business. to be considered a business, the assets in a transaction need to include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. prior to the adoption of the new guidance, the company would consider an acquisition or disposition a business if there were inputs, as well as processes that when applied to those inputs had the ability to create outputs.
in a business combination, the acquisition method of accounting requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded as of the date of the acquisition at their respective fair values with limited exceptions.
60
assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies are recognized at fair value if fair value can reasonably be estimated. if the acquisition date fair value of an asset acquired or liability assumed that arises from a contingency cannot be determined, the asset or liability is recognized if probable and reasonably estimable; if these criteria are not met, no asset or liability is recognized. fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. accordingly, the company may be required to value assets at fair value measures that do not reflect the company's intended use of those assets. any excess of the purchase price (consideration transferred) over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. transaction costs and costs to restructure the acquired company are expensed as incurred. the operating results of the acquired business are reflected in the company's consolidated financial statements after the date of the acquisition. the fair values of intangible assets, including acquired ipr&d, are determined utilizing information available near the acquisition date based on expectations and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management. given the considerable judgment involved in determining fair values, the company typically obtains assistance from third-party valuation specialists for significant items. amounts allocated to acquired ipr&d are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets, subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the projects. upon successful completion of each project, merck will make a separate determination as to the then useful life of the asset, generally determined by the period in which the substantial majority of the cash flows are expected to be generated, and begin amortization. certain of the company's business acquisitions involve the potential for future payment of consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of performance milestones, including product development milestones and royalty payments on future product sales. the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is determined at the acquisition date using unobservable inputs. these inputs include the estimated amount and timing of projected cash flows, the probability of success (achievement of the contingent event) and the risk-adjusted discount rate used to present value the probability-weighted cash flows. subsequent to the acquisition date, at each reporting period, the contingent consideration liability is remeasured at current fair value with changes (either expense or income) recorded in earnings. changes in any of the inputs may result in a significantly different fair value adjustment.
the judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, as well as asset lives, can materially affect the company's results of operations.
if the company determines the transaction will not be accounted for as an acquisition of a business, the transaction will be accounted for as an acquisition of assets rather than a business combination and, therefore, no goodwill will be recorded. in an asset acquisition, acquired ipr&d with no alternative future use is charged to expense at the acquisition date.
the fair values of identifiable intangible assets related to currently marketed products and product rights are primarily determined by using an income approach through which fair value is estimated based on each asset's discounted projected net cash flows. the company's estimates of market participant net cash flows consider historical and projected pricing, margins and expense levels; the performance of competing products where applicable; relevant industry and therapeutic area growth drivers and factors; current and expected trends in technology and product life cycles; the time and investment that will be required to develop products and technologies; the ability to obtain marketing and regulatory approvals; the ability to manufacture and commercialize the products; the extent and timing of potential new product introductions by the company's competitors; and the life of each asset's underlying patent, if any. the net cash flows are then probability-adjusted where appropriate to consider the uncertainties associated with the underlying assumptions, as well as the risk profile of the net cash flows utilized in the valuation. the probability-adjusted future net cash flows of each product are then discounted to present value utilizing an appropriate discount rate.
the fair values of identifiable intangible assets related to ipr&d are also determined using an income approach, through which fair value is estimated based on each asset's probability-adjusted future net cash flows, which reflect the different stages of development of each product and the associated probability of successful completion. the net cash flows are then discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate.
revenue recognition revenues from sales of products are recognized when title and risk of loss passes to the customer, typically at time of delivery. recognition of revenue also requires reasonable assurance of collection of sales proceeds and
61
completion of all performance obligations. domestically, sales discounts are issued to customers as direct discounts at the point-of-sale, indirectly through an intermediary wholesaler, known as chargebacks, or indirectly in the form of rebates. additionally, sales are generally made with a limited right of return under certain conditions. revenues are recorded net of provisions for sales discounts and returns, which are established at the time of sale. in addition, revenues are recorded net of time value of money discounts for customers for which collection of accounts receivable is expected to be in excess of one year.
the provision for aggregate indirect customer discounts covers chargebacks and rebates. chargebacks are discounts that occur when a contracted customer purchases directly through an intermediary wholesaler. the contracted customer generally purchases product at its contracted price plus a mark-up from the wholesaler. the wholesaler, in turn, charges the company back for the difference between the price initially paid by the wholesaler and the contract price paid to the wholesaler by the customer. the provision for chargebacks is based on expected sell-through levels by the company's wholesale customers to contracted customers, as well as estimated wholesaler inventory levels. rebates are amounts owed based upon definitive contractual agreements or legal requirements with private sector and public sector (medicaid and medicare part d) benefit providers, after the final dispensing of the product by a pharmacy to a benefit plan participant. the provision is based on expected payments, which are driven by patient usage and contract performance by the benefit provider customers.
the company uses historical customer segment mix, adjusted for other known events, in order to estimate the expected provision. amounts accrued for aggregate indirect customer discounts are evaluated on a quarterly basis through comparison of information provided by the wholesalers, health maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefit managers and other customers to the amounts accrued. adjustments are recorded when trends or significant events indicate that a change in the estimated provision is appropriate.
the company continually monitors its provision for aggregate indirect customer discounts. there were no material adjustments to estimates associated with the aggregate indirect customer discount provision in 2016, 2015 or 2014.
summarized information about changes in the aggregate indirect customer discount accrual related to u.s. sales is as follows:

balance december 31             $2,945              $2,798
accruals for chargebacks are reflected as a direct reduction to accounts receivable and accruals for rebates as current liabilities. the accrued balances relative to these provisions included in accounts receivable and accrued and other current liabilities were $196 million and $2.7 billion, respectively, at december 31, 2016 and were $145 million and $2.7 billion, respectively, at december 31, 2015.
the company maintains a returns policy that allows its u.s. pharmaceutical customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date (generally, three to six months before and 12 months after product expiration). the estimate of the provision for returns is based upon historical experience with actual returns. additionally, the company considers factors such as levels of inventory in the distribution channel, product dating and expiration period, whether products have been discontinued, entrance in the market of additional generic competition, changes in formularies or launch of over-the-counter products, among others. the product returns provision for u.s. pharmaceutical sales as a percentage of u.s. net pharmaceutical sales was 1.4% in 2016, 1.5% in 2015 and 1.7% in 2014.
through its distribution programs with u.s. wholesalers, the company encourages wholesalers to align purchases with underlying demand and maintain inventories below specified levels. the terms of the programs allow the wholesalers to earn fees upon providing visibility into their inventory levels, as well as by achieving certain performance parameters such as inventory management, customer service levels, reducing shortage claims and reducing product returns. information provided through the wholesaler distribution programs includes items such as sales trends, inventory on-hand, on-order quantity and product returns.
62
wholesalers generally provide only the above mentioned data to the company, as there is no regulatory requirement to report lot level information to manufacturers, which is the level of information needed to determine the remaining shelf life and original sale date of inventory. given current wholesaler inventory levels, which are generally less than a month, the company believes that collection of order lot information across all wholesale customers would have limited use in estimating sales discounts and returns.
inventories produced in preparation for product launches the company capitalizes inventories produced in preparation for product launches sufficient to support estimated initial market demand. typically, capitalization of such inventory does not begin until the related product candidates are in phase 3 clinical trials and are considered to have a high probability of regulatory approval. the company monitors the status of each respective product within the regulatory approval process; however, the company generally does not disclose specific timing for regulatory approval. if the company is aware of any specific risks or contingencies other than the normal regulatory approval process or if there are any specific issues identified during the research process relating to safety, efficacy, manufacturing, marketing or labeling, the related inventory would generally not be capitalized. expiry dates of the inventory are affected by the stage of completion. the company manages the levels of inventory at each stage to optimize the shelf life of the inventory in relation to anticipated market demand in order to avoid product expiry issues. for inventories that are capitalized, anticipated future sales and shelf lives support the realization of the inventory value as the inventory shelf life is sufficient to meet initial product launch requirements. inventories produced in preparation for product launches capitalized at december 31, 2016 and 2015 were $80 million and $63 million, respectively.
contingencies and environmental liabilities the company is involved in various claims and legal proceedings of a nature considered normal to its business, including product liability, intellectual property and commercial litigation, as well as certain additional matters (see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.) the company records accruals for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. these accruals are adjusted periodically as assessments change or additional information becomes available. for product liability claims, a portion of the overall accrual is actuarially determined and considers such factors as past experience, number of claims reported and estimates of claims incurred but not yet reported. individually significant contingent losses are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable.
legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable. some of the significant factors considered in the review of these legal defense reserves are as follows: the actual costs incurred by the company; the development of the company's legal defense strategy and structure in light of the scope of its litigation; the number of cases being brought against the company; the costs and outcomes of completed trials and the most current information regarding anticipated timing, progression, and related costs of pre-trial activities and trials in the associated litigation. the amount of legal defense reserves as of december 31, 2016 and 2015 of approximately $185 million and $245 million, respectively, represents the company's best estimate of the minimum amount of defense costs to be incurred in connection with its outstanding litigation; however, events such as additional trials and other events that could arise in the course of its litigation could affect the ultimate amount of legal defense costs to be incurred by the company. the company will continue to monitor its legal defense costs and review the adequacy of the associated reserves and may determine to increase the reserves at any time in the future if, based upon the factors set forth, it believes it would be appropriate to do so.
the company and its subsidiaries are parties to a number of proceedings brought under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act, commonly known as superfund, and other federal and state equivalents. when a legitimate claim for contribution is asserted, a liability is initially accrued based upon the estimated transaction costs to manage the site. accruals are adjusted as site investigations, feasibility studies and related cost assessments of remedial techniques are completed, and as the extent to which other potentially responsible parties who may be jointly and severally liable can be expected to contribute is determined.
the company is also remediating environmental contamination resulting from past industrial activity at certain of its sites and takes an active role in identifying and accruing for these costs. in the past, merck performed a worldwide survey to assess all sites for potential contamination resulting from past industrial activities. where assessment indicated that physical investigation was warranted, such investigation was performed, providing a better evaluation of the need for remedial action. where such need was identified, remedial action was then initiated. as
63
definitive information became available during the course of investigations and/or remedial efforts at each site, estimates were refined and accruals were established or adjusted accordingly. these estimates and related accruals continue to be refined annually.
the company believes that there are no compliance issues associated with applicable environmental laws and regulations that would have a material adverse effect on the company. expenditures for remediation and environmental liabilities were $11 million in 2016, and are estimated at $44 million in the aggregate for the years 2017 through 2021. in management's opinion, the liabilities for all environmental matters that are probable and reasonably estimable have been accrued and totaled $83 million and $109 million at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. these liabilities are undiscounted, do not consider potential recoveries from other parties and will be paid out over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites, which are expected to occur primarily over the next 15 years. although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these matters, or the ultimate costs of remediation, management does not believe that any reasonably possible expenditures that may be incurred in excess of the liabilities accrued should exceed $64 million in the aggregate. management also does not believe that these expenditures should result in a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources for any year.
share-based compensation the company expenses all share-based payment awards to employees, including grants of stock options, over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value of the awards. the company determines the fair value of certain share-based awards using the black-scholes option-pricing model which uses both historical and current market data to estimate the fair value. this method incorporates various assumptions such as the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, expected dividend yield and expected life of the options. total pretax share-based compensation expense was $300 million in 2016, $299 million in 2015 and $278 million in 2014. at december 31, 2016, there was $443 million of total pretax unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested stock option, restricted stock unit and performance share unit awards which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.9 years. for segment reporting, share-based compensation costs are unallocated expenses.
pensions and other postretirement benefit plans net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled $56 million in 2016, $253 million in 2015 and $169 million in 2014. pension and other postretirement benefit plan information for financial reporting purposes is calculated using actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan benefit obligations and an expected rate of return on plan assets. the changes in net periodic benefit cost year over year for pension plans are largely attributable to changes in the discount rate affecting net amortization. the decrease in net periodic benefit cost for other postretirement benefit plans in 2016 as compared with 2015 is largely attributable to changes in retiree medical benefits approved by the company in december 2015.
the company reassesses its benefit plan assumptions on a regular basis. for both the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, the discount rate is evaluated on measurement dates and modified to reflect the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality fixed-income debt instruments that would provide the future cash flows needed to pay the benefits included in the benefit obligation as they come due. the discount rates for the company's u.s. pension and other postretirement benefit plans ranged from 3.40% to 4.30% at december 31, 2016, compared with a range of 3.80% to 4.80% at december 31, 2015.
the expected rate of return for both the pension and other postretirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. in developing the expected rate of return, the company considers long-term compound annualized returns of historical market data as well as actual returns on the company's plan assets. using this reference information, the company develops forward-looking return expectations for each asset category and a weighted-average expected long-term rate of return for a target portfolio allocated across these investment categories. the expected portfolio performance reflects the contribution of active management as appropriate. for 2017, the expected rate of return for the company's u.s. pension and other postretirement benefit plans will range from 8.00% to 8.75%, as compared to a range of 7.30% to 8.75% in 2016.
the company has established investment guidelines for its u.s. pension and other postretirement plans to create an asset allocation that is expected to deliver a rate of return sufficient to meet the long-term obligation of each plan, given an acceptable level of risk. the target investment portfolio of the company's u.s. pension and other
64
postretirement benefit plans is allocated 40% to 60% in u.s. equities, 20% to 40% in international equities, 15% to 25% in fixed-income investments, and up to 5% in cash and other investments. the portfolio's equity weighting is consistent with the long-term nature of the plans' benefit obligations. the expected annual standard deviation of returns of the target portfolio, which approximates 13%, reflects both the equity allocation and the diversification benefits among the asset classes in which the portfolio invests. for non-u.s. pension plans, the targeted investment portfolio varies based on the duration of pension liabilities and local government rules and regulations. although a significant percentage of plan assets are invested in u.s. equities, concentration risk is mitigated through the use of strategies that are diversified within management guidelines.
actuarial assumptions are based upon management's best estimates and judgment. a reasonably possible change of plus (minus) 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $81 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on the company's current year net periodic benefit cost. a reasonably possible change of plus (minus) 25 basis points in the expected rate of return assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $46 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on merck's current year net periodic benefit cost. required funding obligations for 2017 relating to the company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans are not expected to be material. the preceding hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected rate of return assumptions would not impact the company's funding requirements.
net loss amounts, which reflect experience differentials primarily relating to differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recorded as a component of aoci. expected returns for pension plans are based on a calculated market-related value of assets. under this methodology, asset gains/losses resulting from actual returns that differ from the company's expected returns are recognized in the market-related value of assets ratably over a five-year period. also, net loss amounts in aoci in excess of certain thresholds are amortized into net periodic benefit cost over the average remaining service life of employees.
restructuring costs restructuring costs have been recorded in connection with restructuring programs designed to streamline the company's cost structure. as a result, the company has made estimates and judgments regarding its future plans, including future termination benefits and other exit costs to be incurred when the restructuring actions take place. when accruing these costs, the company will recognize the amount within a range of costs that is the best estimate within the range. when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the company recognizes the minimum amount within the range. in connection with these actions, management also assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business. in certain instances, asset lives have been shortened based on changes in the expected useful lives of the affected assets. severance and other related costs are reflected within restructuring costs. asset-related charges are reflected within materials and production costs, marketing and administrative expenses and research and development expenses depending upon the nature of the asset.
impairments of long-lived assets the company assesses changes in economic, regulatory and legal conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the company's property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets.
the company periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying values of its long-lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. if such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows of these assets, or appropriate asset groupings, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. if the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset's fair value and its carrying value. if quoted market prices are not available, the company will estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows approach.
goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired and is assigned to reporting units. the company tests its goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist, by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macroeconomic conditions, conditions specific to the industry and market, cost factors which could have a significant effect on earnings or cash flows, the overall financial performance of the reporting unit, and whether there have been sustained declines in the company's share price. additionally, the company evaluates
65
the extent to which the fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit at the last date a valuation was performed. if the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative fair value test is performed.
other acquired intangible assets (excluding ipr&d) are recorded at fair value, assigned an estimated useful life, and are amortized primarily on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. when events or circumstances warrant a review, the company will assess recoverability from future operations using pretax undiscounted cash flows derived from the lowest appropriate asset groupings. impairments are recognized in operating results to the extent that the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, which is determined based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows.
ipr&d that the company acquires through business combinations represents the fair value assigned to incomplete research projects which, at the time of acquisition, have not reached technological feasibility. the amounts are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets, subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the project. the company tests ipr&d for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist, by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the ipr&d intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. if the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount, a quantitative test that compares the fair value of the ipr&d intangible asset with its carrying value is performed. for impairment testing purposes, the company may combine separately recorded ipr&d intangible assets into one unit of account based on the relevant facts and circumstances. generally, the company will combine ipr&d intangible assets for testing purposes if they operate as a single asset and are essentially inseparable. if the fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized within the company's operating results.
the judgments made in evaluating impairment of long-lived intangibles can materially affect the company's results of operations.
impairments of investments the company reviews its investments for impairments based on the determination of whether the decline in market value of the investment below the carrying value is other-than-temporary. the company considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairments of its investments, including the duration and extent to which fair value is less than cost and, for equity securities, the company's ability and intent to hold the investments. for debt securities, an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred if the company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the debt security. if the company does not intend to sell the impaired debt security, and it is not more likely than not it will be required to sell the debt security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis, the amount of the other-than-temporary impairment recognized in earnings is limited to the portion attributed to credit loss. the remaining portion of the other-than-temporary impairment related to other factors is recognized in oci.
taxes on income the company's effective tax rate is based on pretax income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates. an estimated effective tax rate for a year is applied to the company's quarterly operating results. in the event that there is a significant unusual or one-time item recognized, or expected to be recognized, in the company's quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as the unusual or one-time item. the company considers the resolution of prior year tax matters to be such items. significant judgment is required in determining the company's tax provision and in evaluating its tax positions. the recognition and measurement of a tax position is based on management's best judgment given the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. the company evaluates tax positions to determine whether the benefits of tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the company recognizes the largest amount of the benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements. for tax positions that are not more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the company does not recognize any portion of the benefit in the financial statements. if the more likely than not threshold is not met in the period for which a tax position is taken, the company may subsequently recognize the benefit of that tax position if the tax matter is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires, or if the more likely than not threshold is met in a subsequent period (see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.)

tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which the company has already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. the company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred or expense for which the company has already taken a deduction on the tax return, but has not yet recognized as expense in the financial statements. at december 31, 2016, foreign earnings of $63.1 billion have been retained indefinitely by subsidiary companies for reinvestment; therefore, no provision has been made for income taxes that would be payable upon the distribution of such earnings and it would not be practicable to determine the amount of the related unrecognized deferred income tax liability.
recently issued accounting standards in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued amended accounting guidance on revenue recognition that will be applied to all contracts with customers. the objective of the new guidance is to improve comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities and to provide more useful information to users of financial statements through improved disclosure requirements. in august 2015, the fasb approved a one-year deferral of the effective date making this guidance effective for interim and annual periods beginning in 2018. the new standard permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of adopting the guidance being recognized at the date of initial application (modified retrospective method). the company will adopt the new standard on january 1, 2018 and currently plans to use the modified retrospective method. the majority of the company's business is ship and bill and, on that primary revenue stream, merck does not expect significant differences. however, the company's analysis is preliminary and subject to change. merck has not completed its assessment of multiple element arrangements and certain discount and trade promotion programs.
in january 2016, the fasb issued revised guidance for the accounting and reporting of financial instruments. the new guidance requires that equity investments with readily determinable fair values currently classified as available for sale be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. the new guidance also simplifies the impairment testing of equity investments without readily determinable fair values and changes certain disclosure requirements. this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning in 2018. early adoption is not permitted. the company is currently assessing the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.
in february 2016, the fasb issued new accounting guidance for the accounting and reporting of leases. the new guidance requires that lessees recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability recorded on the balance sheet for each of its leases (other than leases that meet the definition of a short-term lease).  leases will be classified as either operating or finance. operating leases will result in straight-line expense in the income statement (similar to current operating leases) while finance leases will result in more expense being recognized in the earlier years of the lease term (similar to current capital leases). the new guidance will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning in 2019. early adoption is permitted. the company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.
in june 2016, the fasb issued amended guidance on the accounting for credit losses on financial instruments within its scope. the guidance introduces an expected loss model for estimating credit losses, replacing the incurred loss model. the new guidance also changes the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities, requiring the use of an allowance to record estimated credit losses (and subsequent recoveries). the new guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning in 2020, with earlier application permitted in 2019. the company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.
in august 2016, the fasb issued guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows intended to reduce diversity in practice. the guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning in 2018. early adoption is permitted. the guidance is to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented but may be applied prospectively if retrospective application would be impracticable. the company is currently evaluating the effect of the standard on its consolidated statement of cash flows.
67
in october 2016, the fasb issued guidance on the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. under existing guidance, the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer is prohibited until the asset has been sold to a third party. the new guidance will require the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset (with the exception of inventory) when the intra-entity transfer occurs. the guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning in 2018. early adoption is permitted. the new guidance is to be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings in the beginning of the period of adoption. the company does not anticipate the adoption of the new guidance will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.
in november 2016, the fasb issued guidance requiring that amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. the guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning in 2018 and should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. early adoption is permitted. the company is currently evaluating the effect of the standard on its consolidated statement of cash flows.
in january 2017, the fasb issued guidance that provides for the elimination of step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. if impairment charges are recognized, the amount recorded will be the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value with certain limitations. the new guidance is effective for interim and annual periods in 2021. the company does not anticipate the adoption of the new guidance will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.
cautionary factors that may affect future results this report and other written reports and oral statements made from time to time by the company may contain so-called "forward-looking statements," all of which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause results to differ materially from those set forth in the statements. one can identify these forward-looking statements by their use of words such as "anticipates," "expects," "plans," "will," "estimates," "forecasts," "projects" and other words of similar meaning. one can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. these statements are likely to address the company's growth strategy, financial results, product development, product approvals, product potential and development programs. one must carefully consider any such statement and should understand that many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the company's forward-looking statements. these factors include inaccurate assumptions and a broad variety of other risks and uncertainties, including some that are known and some that are not. no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual future results may vary materially.
the company does not assume the obligation to update any forward-looking statement. one should carefully evaluate such statements in light of factors, including risk factors, described in the company's filings with the securities and exchange commission, especially on this form 10-k and forms 10-q and 8-k. in item 1a. "risk factors" of this annual report on form 10-k the company discusses in more detail various important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historic results. the company notes these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. one should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. consequently, the reader should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations please read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
trends in our business the following trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate that they will continue to impact our future results:
•users' behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves.
the continuing shift from an offline to online world has contributed to the growth of our business since inception, resulting in increasing revenues, and we expect that this online shift will continue to benefit our business.
•as online advertising evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings which may impact our monetization.
as interactions between users and advertisers change, we continue to expand and evolve our product offerings to serve their changing needs. over time, we expect our monetization trends to fluctuate. for example, we have seen an increase in youtube engagement ads, which monetize at a lower rate than traditional desktop search ads. additionally, we continue to see a shift to programmatic buying which presents opportunities for advertisers to connect with the right user, in the right moment, in the right context. programmatic buying has a different monetization profile than traditional advertising buying on google properties. these trends will continue to affect our revenues and margins in the future.
•users are increasingly using multiple devices to access our products and services, and our advertising revenues are increasingly coming from mobile and other new formats.
our users are accessing the internet via multiple devices and want to feel connected no matter where they are or what they are doing. we seek to expand our products and services to stay in front of this shift in order to maintain and grow our business.
in this multi-device world, we generate our advertising revenues increasingly from mobile and newer advertising formats, and the margins from the advertising revenues from these sources have generally been lower than those from traditional desktop search. we also expect traffic acquisition costs (tac) paid to our distribution partners to increase due to changes in device mix between mobile, desktop, and tablet, partner mix, partner agreement terms, and the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points. we expect these trends to continue to put pressure on our overall margins.
•as users in developing economies increasingly come online, our revenues from international markets continue to increase and movements in foreign exchange rates impact such revenues.
the shift to online, as well as the advent of the multi-device world, has brought opportunities outside of the u.s., including in emerging markets, and we continue to develop localized versions of our products and relevant advertising programs useful to our users in these markets. this has led to a trend of increased revenues from international markets over time and we expect that our results will continue to be impacted by our performance in these markets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available.
our international revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the u.s. dollar. while we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings.
•the portion of our revenues that we derive from non-advertising revenues is increasing.
non-advertising revenues have grown over time. we expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our google offerings to our users through products and services like google cloud, google play, and hardware products. across these initiatives, we currently derive non-advertising revenues primarily from hardware sales, sales of apps, in-app purchases and digital content products, and service and licensing fees; the margins on these non-advertising businesses vary significantly and may be lower than the margins on our advertising business. a number of our other bets initiatives are in their initial development stages, and as such, the sources of revenues from these businesses could change over time and the revenues could be volatile.

•as we continue to look for new ways to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in r&d and our capital expenditures will continue to fluctuate.
we continue to make significant research and development (r&d) investments in areas of strategic focus for google, such as search, advertising, and machine learning, as well as in new products and services across both google and other bets. the amount of our capital expenditures has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate in the long term as we invest heavily in our systems, data centers, real estate and facilities, and information technology infrastructure.
in addition, acquisitions remain an important part of our strategy and use of capital, and we expect to continue to spend cash on acquisitions and other investments. these acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of our offerings, as well as expand our expertise in engineering and other functional areas.
•   our employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them.
our employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. their energy and talent drive alphabet and create our success. we expect to continue hiring talented employees around the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs to our employees.

information about segments we operate our business in multiple operating segments. google is our only reportable segment. none of our other segments meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable segments; therefore, the other operating segments are combined and disclosed below as other bets.
our reported segments are described below:
•   google - google includes our main internet products such as search, ads, commerce, maps, youtube, google cloud, android, chrome, and google play as well as our hardware initiatives. our technical infrastructure and some newer efforts like virtual reality are also included in google. google generates revenues primarily from advertising, sales of digital content, apps and cloud offerings, and sales of hardware products.
•   other bets - other bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. other bets includes businesses such as access, calico, capitalg, gv, nest, verily, waymo, and x. revenues from the other bets are derived primarily through the sales of internet and tv services through google fiber, sales of nest products and services, and licensing and r&amp;d services through verily.

use of monetization metrics when assessing our advertising revenue performance, we present information regarding the percentage change in the number of "paid clicks" and "cost-per-click" for our google properties and google network members' properties. management views these as important metrics for understanding our business. we periodically review, refine and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and for identifying the revenues generated by click activity.
paid clicks for our google properties represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users related to searches on google.com, clicks related to advertisements on other owned and operated properties including gmail, maps, and google play; and viewed youtube engagement ads like trueview (counted as an engagement when the user chooses not to skip the ad) and certain trial ad formats. paid clicks for our google network members' properties include clicks by end-users related to advertisements served on google network members' properties participating in our adsense for search, adsense for content and admob businesses. in some cases, such as programmatic and reservation based advertising buying, we charge advertisers by impression; while growing, this represents a small part of our revenue base.
cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenue divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.
revenue growth and the change in revenue growth, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on google properties and google network members' properties and the correlation between these items, has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate because of various factors, including:
•   growth rates of our revenues from google properties, including youtube, compared to those of our revenues from google network members' properties;
•   advertiser competition for keywords;
•   changes in foreign currency exchange rates;
•   seasonality;
24

•   the fees advertisers are willing to pay based on how they manage their advertising costs;
•   changes in advertising quality or formats;
•   changes in device mix;
•   traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various advertising verticals and channels;
•   a shift in the proportion of non-click based revenue generated on google properties and google network members' properties, including an increase in programmatic and reservation based advertising buying; and
•   general economic conditions.
our advertising revenue growth rate has fluctuated over time as a result of a number of factors, including increasing competition, query growth rates, challenges in maintaining our growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels, the evolution of the online advertising market, our investments in new business strategies, changes in our product mix, and shifts in the geographic mix of our revenues. we also expect that our revenue growth rate will continue to be affected by evolving user preferences, the acceptance by users of our products and services as they are delivered on diverse devices, our ability to create a seamless experience for both users and advertisers, and movements in foreign currency exchange rates.

google properties revenues consist primarily of advertising revenue that is generated on:
•   google search properties. this includes revenue from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.;
•   other google owned and operated properties like gmail, maps, and google play; and
•   youtube, including but not limited to, youtube trueview and google preferred.
our google properties revenues increased $11,428 million from 2015 to 2016 and also increased as a percentage of google segment revenues. the growth was primarily driven by increases in mobile search most notably due to ongoing improvements in ad formats and delivery launched during 2016. we also experienced growth in youtube revenue driven primarily by video advertising across trueview with a growing contribution from ad buying on doubleclick bid manager, as well as improvements in ad formats and delivery. the growth was partially offset by the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.
the number of paid clicks through our advertising programs on google properties increased from 2015 to 2016 due to growth in the adoption of youtube engagement ads, improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery, and continued global expansion of our products, advertisers and user base across all platforms, particularly mobile. the positive impact on our revenues from paid clicks was partially offset by a decrease in the cost-per-click paid by our advertisers. the decrease in cost-per-click was primarily driven by continued growth in youtube engagement ads where cost-per-click remains lower than on our other advertising platforms, and also impacted by changes in device mix, property mix, product mix, geographic mix, and ongoing product changes, and the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.
our google properties revenues increased $7,272 million from 2014 to 2015 and also increased as a percentage of google segment revenues. our google properties revenue growth was primarily driven by increases in mobile search due to ongoing improvements in ad formats, as well as growth in youtube video advertising across trueview and google preferred, partially offset by the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.
the number of paid clicks through our advertising programs on google properties increased from 2014 to 2015 due to an increase in aggregate traffic on google owned properties, the adoption of advertising formats such as youtube engagement ads, and continued global expansion of our products, advertisers, and user base across all platforms, particularly mobile. the positive impact on our revenues from paid clicks was partially offset by a decrease

in the cost-per-click paid by our advertisers. the decrease was primarily driven by continued growth in youtube engagement ads where cost-per-click remains lower than on our other advertising platforms, as well as changes in property and device mix, product mix, geographic mix, and ongoing product changes, and the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.

google network members' properties revenues consist primarily of advertising revenues generated from ads placed on google network member properties through:
•   adsense (such as adsense for search, adsense for content, etc.);
•   admob; and
•   doubleclick adexchange.
our google network members' properties revenues increased $565 million from 2015 to 2016. the growth was primarily driven by strength in programmatic advertising buying as well as strength in admob, offset by a decline in our traditional adsense business and the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.
the increase in paid clicks from 2015 to 2016 resulted from the growth in admob offset by declines in adsense. the decrease in cost-per-click paid by our advertisers from 2015 to 2016 resulted from changes in the product mix of google network members advertising revenues, ongoing product and policy changes, changes in property and device mix, geographic mix, and relative fluctuations of the u.s. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.
our google network members' properties revenues increased $494 million from 2014 to 2015. the increase was primarily driven by strength in programmatic advertising buying, offset by our continued adsense advertising policy changes aimed at enriching the experience for users and the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies. the decrease in google network members' properties revenues as a percentage of google segment revenues is due to relatively slower growth of google network members' properties revenues compared to that of google properties revenues as well as google other revenues.
the decreases in both paid clicks and cost-per-click paid by our advertisers from 2014 to 2015 were primarily driven by ongoing product and policy changes designed to reduce lower quality inventory on adsense for search, changes in property and device mix, product mix, and geographic mix, and the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.

•   hardware;
•   licensing-related revenue; and
•   service fees received for our google cloud offerings.
26
alphabet inc.
our google other revenues increased $2,926 million from 2015 to 2016 and increased as a percentage of google segment revenues. these increases were primarily due to the growth in revenues from google play, primarily relating to in-app purchases (revenues which we recognize net of payout to developers), hardware sales, and google cloud offerings.
our google other revenues increased $1,104 million from 2014 to 2015 and increased as a percentage of google segment revenues. these increases were primarily due to the growth of our sales of digital content products in the google play store, primarily apps (revenues which we recognize net of payout to partners). in addition, there was an increase in revenues from service fees received for google cloud offerings. these increases were partially offset by the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.

other bets revenues consist primarily of revenues and sales from:
•   internet and tv services;
•   licensing and r&amp;d services; and
•   nest branded hardware.
our other bets revenues increased $364 million from 2015 to 2016 and increased as a percentage of consolidated revenues. these increases were primarily driven by sales of nest branded hardware and revenues from fiber internet and tv services. there was also an increase in revenues from verily licensing and r&d services from 2015 to 2016.
our other bets revenues increased $118 million from 2014 to 2015 and remained relatively flat as a percentage of consolidated revenues. the increase was primarily due to increases in revenues from sales of nest branded hardware and revenues from internet and tv services, partially offset by a decrease in licensing revenues. as nest was acquired in february 2014, the increase in our nest revenues is impacted by a partial year of revenues in 2014 as compared to a full year in 2015.
due to the early stage of our other bets businesses and because their revenues aggregates a number of businesses operating in different industries, our other bets revenues may fluctuate in future periods. additionally, our other bets revenues may fluctuate due to one-time items.

use of constant currency revenues and constant currency revenue growth the impact of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons. our international revenues are favorably impacted as the u.s. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies, and unfavorably impacted as the u.s dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. we use non-gaap constant currency revenues and constant currency revenue growth for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to gaap results helps improve the ability to understand our performance because they exclude the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.
27
alphabet inc.
constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. we define constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, and use it to determine the constant currency revenue growth on a year-on-year basis. constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging impacts realized in the current period.
constant currency revenue growth (expressed as a percentage) is calculated by determining the increase in current period revenues over prior period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior period exchange rates and hedging benefits are excluded from revenues of both periods.
these results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with gaap. results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with gaap.

additionally, other cost of revenues (which is the cost of revenues excluding traffic acquisition costs) includes the following:
•   the expenses associated with the operation of our data centers (including depreciation, labor, energy, bandwidth, and other equipment costs);
•   content acquisition costs primarily related to payments to certain content providers from whom we license their video and other content for distribution on youtube and google play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee);
•   credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions;
•   stock-based compensation expense;

the cost of revenues that we incur related to revenues generated from ads placed on the properties of our google network members are significantly higher than the costs of revenues we incur related to revenues generated from ads placed on google properties because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on google network members' properties are paid as tac to our google network members.
cost of revenues increased $6,974 million from 2015 to 2016 due to various factors including traffic acquisition costs, data center costs, content acquisition costs, and hardware costs. the increase in traffic acquisition costs of $2,450 million was due to increases in advertising revenues primarily from the growth of mobile search and programmatic ad buying which carry higher tac. the increase in other cost of revenues of $4,524 million was primarily due to increases in (1) data centers costs including depreciation, labor, energy, bandwidth, and other equipment costs as a result of business growth, (2) content acquisition costs as a result of increased activities related to youtube, (3) hardware costs associated with new hardware launches, and (4) stock-based compensation.

the aggregate tac rate remained relatively flat from 2015 to 2016 primarily as a result of a shift of mix from google network members' properties revenue to google properties revenue. our aggregate tac rate was also impacted by the increase in mobile and programmatic advertising buying, which generally carry overall higher tac.
the increase in google properties tac rate was primarily driven by a shift to mobile and more mobile searches are subject to tac. the increase in network members' tac rate was primarily driven by the shift in advertising buying from our traditional network business to programmatic advertising buying.
cost of revenues increased $2,473 million from 2014 to 2015. the increase was primarily due to data center costs and an increase in content acquisition costs as a result of increased activities related to youtube and digital content. the remaining increase was driven by increases in traffic acquisition costs of $846 million, resulting from more advertiser fees generated through our adsense program driven primarily by an increase in advertising revenues, as well as more fees paid to our distribution partners for additional traffic directed to our websites. additionally, there was an impairment charge of $378 million recognized in 2014 related to a patent licensing royalty asset acquired in connection with the motorola acquisition that did not recur in 2015.
the decrease in aggregate tac rate from 2014 to 2015 was primarily a result of a shift of mix from google network members' properties revenue to google properties revenue.
we expect cost of revenues to increase in dollar amount and as a percentage of total revenues in 2017 and future periods based on a number of factors, including the following:
•   the relative revenue growth rates of google properties and our google network members' properties;
•   traffic acquisition costs paid to our distribution partners, which are affected by changes in device mix between mobile, desktop, and tablet, partner mix, partner agreement terms such as revenue share arrangements, and the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points;
•   traffic acquisition costs paid to google network members, which are affected by ongoing adoption of programmatic advertising buying and changes in partner agreement terms;
•   the growth rates of expenses associated with our data center operations, content acquisition costs, as well as our hardware inventory and related costs; and
•   increased proportion of non-advertising revenues as part of our total revenues.

r&d expenses consist primarily of:
•   labor and facilities-related costs for employees responsible for r&amp;d of our existing and new products and services;
•   depreciation and equipment-related expenses; and
•   stock-based compensation expense.
r&d expenses increased $1,666 million from 2015 to 2016. the increase was primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $667 million and an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $326 million both largely as a result of a 16% increase in r&d headcount partially offset by higher expenses resulting from project milestones in other bets in 2015. in addition, there was an increase in depreciation and equipment-related expenses of approximately $388 million and an increase in professional services of $267 million due to additional expenses incurred for consulting, outsourced services, and temporary services.
r&d expenses increased $2,450 million and increased as a percentage of revenues from 2014 to 2015. these increases were primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $1,502 million and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $487 million, both largely as a result of a 16% increase in r&d headcount. the increase in labor and facilities-related costs was also impacted by expenses resulting from project milestones in other bets established several years ago. in addition, there was an increase in depreciation and equipment-related expenses of approximately $248 million and an increase in professional services of $174 million due to additional expenses incurred for consulting and outsourced services.

•   labor and facilities-related costs for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain customer service functions;
•   advertising and promotional expenditures related to our products and services; and
•   stock-based compensation expense.
sales and marketing expenses increased $1,438 million from 2015 to 2016. the increase was primarily due to an increase in advertising and promotional expenses of $679 million largely due to increases in marketing and promotion related expenses for our hardware products. additionally, there was an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $482 million and stock-based compensation expense of $179 million, both largely resulting from a 10% increase in sales and marketing headcount.
sales and marketing expenses increased $916 million and remained relatively flat as a percentage of revenues from 2014 to 2015. the increase in dollar amount was primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $329 million and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $184 million, largely resulting from a 12% increase in sales and marketing headcount. in addition, there was an increase in advertising and promotional expenses of $184 million and an increase in professional service fees of $158 million due to additional expenses incurred for consulting and outsourced services.

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of:
•   labor and facilities-related costs for employees in our facilities, finance, human resources, information technology, and legal organizations;
•   depreciation and equipment-related expenses;
•   professional services fees primarily related to outside legal, audit, information technology consulting, and outsourcing services;
•   amortization of certain intangible assets; and
•   stock-based compensation expense.
general and administrative expenses increased $849 million from 2015 to 2016. the increase was primarily due to increases in labor and facilities-related costs of $460 million and stock-based compensation expense of $421 million, both largely resulting from a 15% increase in general and administrative headcount, as well as increases in other miscellaneous expenses. these increases were offset by a decrease in professional service fees of $194 million due to lower legal-related costs.
general and administrative expenses increased $285 million and decreased as a percentage of revenues from 2014 to 2015. the increase in dollar amount was primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $136 million and an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $69 million, both largely resulting from a 15% increase in general and administrative headcount. in addition, there was an increase in depreciation and equipment-

related expenses of $121 million and an increase of $80 million of miscellaneous general and administrative expenses. these factors were partially offset by a decrease in professional services fees and expenses of $128 million, primarily due to lower legal-related costs.

stock-based compensation related to awards we expected to settle in equity increased $1,500 million from 2015 to 2016 and $1,028 million from 2014 to 2015. these increases were primarily driven by headcount growth.
we estimate stock-based compensation expense related to awards we expect to settle in equity to be approximately $6.3 billion in 2017 and $8.3 billion thereafter related to stock-based awards outstanding as of december 31, 2016. these estimates do not include expense related to stock-based awards granted after december 31, 2016.

other income (expense), net, increased $143 million from 2015 to 2016. this increase was primarily driven by an increase in interest income and decreased losses on non-marketable investments, partially offset by increased losses from our foreign currency transactions and impairments for certain assets.
other income (expense), net, decreased $472 million from 2014 to 2015. this decrease was primarily related to a writedown of securities received in conjunction with the sale of a business as well as reduced gains on non-marketable investments as compared to 2014. these decreases were partially offset by an increase in interest income as a result of increased cash and fixed income investments.
the costs of our foreign exchange hedging activities recognized in other income (expense), net, are primarily a function of the notional amount of the option and forward contracts and their related duration, the movement of foreign exchange rates relative to the contract prices, the volatility of foreign exchange rates and forward points. as we began using foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our forecasted revenues in the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect the hedging costs expensed in other income (expense), net, will decrease in 2017 and future periods as a result of less option premiums paid.

our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate increased from 2015 to 2016, largely due to proportionately more earnings generated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates and discrete items in 2015 and 2016, partially offset by the stock-based compensation benefits recognized resulting from the adoption of accounting standards update no. 2016-09 (asu 2016-09).

our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate decreased from 2014 to 2015, largely due to a discrete benefit recognized in 2015 as a result of the resolution of a multi-year u.s. tax audit related to prior years and proportionately more earnings generated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates.
our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates, the net gains and losses recognized by legal entities on certain hedges and related hedged intercompany and other transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items.
quarterly results of operations the following tables presenting our quarterly results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. we have prepared the unaudited information on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements. our operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future quarters or for a full year.
the following table presents our unaudited quarterly results of operations for the eight quarters ended december 31, 2016. this table includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated financial position and operating results for the quarters presented. both seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures and underlying business trends such as traditional retail seasonality have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our business. commercial queries typically increase significantly in the fourth quarter of each year. these seasonal trends have caused, and will likely continue to cause, fluctuations in our quarterly results, including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates.

capital resources and liquidity as of december 31, 2016, we had $86.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market and other funds, highly liquid debt instruments of the u.s. government and its agencies, debt instruments issued by foreign governments, debt instruments issued by municipalities in the u.s., corporate debt securities, agency mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities. from time to time, we may hold marketable equity securities obtained through acquisitions or strategic investments in private companies that subsequently go public.
as of december 31, 2016, $52.2 billion of the $86.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. if these funds were needed for our operations in the u.s., we would be required to accrue and pay u.s. taxes to repatriate these funds. however, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the u.s. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our u.s. operations.
our principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from our operations. we have a short-term debt financing program of up to $5.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. we had no commercial paper outstanding as of december 31, 2016. in conjunction with this program, we have a $4.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring in february 2021. the interest rate for the credit facility is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. as of december 31, 2016, no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. we believe that our sources of funding will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements including capital expenditures, working capital requirements, potential acquisitions and other liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months.
as of december 31, 2016, we have unsecured senior notes outstanding due in 2021, 2024, and 2026 with a total carrying value of $3.9 billion and a total estimated fair value of $3.9 billion.
in august 2013, we entered into a capital lease obligation on certain property expiring in 2028. in september 2016, we exercised our option to purchase the property for approximately $220 million.
in october 2015, the board of directors of alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $5,099,019,513.59 of its class c capital stock, commencing in the fourth quarter of 2015. in january 2016, the board of directors of alphabet authorized the company to repurchase an additional amount of approximately 514 thousand shares. we completed all authorized share repurchases under this repurchase program.
in october 2016, the board of directors of alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $7,019,340,976.83 of its class c capital stock. the repurchases are expected to be executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through rule 10b5-1 plans. no shares were repurchased in 2016 under this program.
in january 2017, temasek, a singapore-based investment company, signed a binding commitment to purchase a non-controlling interest in verily for an aggregate of $800 million in cash. we closed the first tranche of the investment in february 2017 and anticipate closing the second and final tranche upon completion of certain terms in the second half of 2017.

cash provided by operating activities our largest source of cash provided by our operations are advertising revenues generated by google properties and google network members' properties. additionally, we generate cash through sales of apps, in-app purchases and digital content, hardware products, licensing arrangements, and service fees received for google cloud offerings.
our primary uses of cash from our operating activities include payments to our google network members and distribution partners, and payments for content acquisition costs. in addition, uses of cash from operating activities include compensation and related costs, hardware costs, other general corporate expenditures, and income taxes.

alphabet inc.
net cash provided by operating activities increased from 2015 to 2016 primarily due to increases in cash received from advertising revenues and google other revenues, offset by increases in cash paid for cost of revenues and operating expenses. additionally, the timing of tax payments and refunds had a favorable impact to our cash flows from operations for 2016 compared to 2015.
net cash provided by operating activities increased from 2014 to 2015 primarily due to increased net income adjusted for depreciation and stock-based compensation expense, and loss on sales of marketable and non-marketable securities. this was partially offset by a net decrease in cash from changes in working capital.
cash used in investing activities cash provided by or used in investing activities primarily consists of purchases of property and equipment, purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities in our investment portfolio, investments in reverse repurchase agreements and the cash collateral received or returned from our securities lending program, as well as acquisitions and divestitures of businesses and intangible assets.
net cash used in investing activities increased from 2015 to 2016 primarily due to increases in purchases of marketable securities, increases in cash collateral paid related to securities lending and increases in spend related to acquisitions partially offset by increases in maturities and sales of marketable securities and decreases in purchases of non-marketable investments.
net cash used in investing activities increased from 2014 to 2015 primarily due to net increases in purchases of marketable securities, activities related to securities lending and purchases of non-marketable investments. this increase was partially offset by lower spend related to acquisitions, lower investments in reverse repurchase agreements, and a decrease in capital expenditures related to our production equipment, data centers, and real estate purchases.
cash used in financing activities cash used in financing activities consists primarily of net proceeds or payments from issuance or repayments of debt, repurchases of capital stock, and net proceeds or payments from stock-based award activities.
net cash used in financing activities increased from 2015 to 2016 primarily driven by decreases in proceeds from issuance of debt, and increases in the repurchases of capital stock and net payments related to stock-based award activities, partially offset by a decrease in debt repayments.

estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. as a result, this amount is not included in the above table.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of regulation s-k promulgated by the sec, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues, or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors.
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). in doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. in some cases, we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates. in some cases, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations will be affected. we base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. we refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss further below. we have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors.
please see note 1 of part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for the summary of significant accounting policies.
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made. the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties. in addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
loss contingencies we are regularly subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings involving competition and antitrust, intellectual property, privacy, indirect taxes, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, and other matters. certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. we record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. if we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
we evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our disclosures as appropriate. significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters. until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material impact on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. see note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding contingencies.

business combinations we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. when determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.
critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships and acquired patents and developed technology and discount rates. management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.
other estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as more fully discussed in note 6 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
goodwill goodwill is allocated to reporting units expected to benefit from the business combination. we evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. goodwill impairment tests require judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit.
long-lived assets long-lived assets, including property and equipment, long-term prepayments, and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated from the assets are less than their carrying amount. measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value.
impairment of marketable and non-marketable securities we periodically review our marketable and non-marketable securities for impairment. if we conclude that any of these investments are impaired, we determine whether such impairment is other-than-temporary. factors we consider to make such determination include the duration and severity of the impairment, the reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery period and our intent to sell. for marketable debt securities, we also consider whether (1) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, and (2) the amortized cost basis cannot be recovered as a result of credit losses. if any impairment is considered other-than-temporary, we will write down the asset to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as other income (expense), net.

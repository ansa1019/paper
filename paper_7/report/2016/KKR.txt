item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of kkr and the related notes included elsewhere in this report. the historical consolidated financial data discussed below reflects the historical results and financial position of kkr. in addition, this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described under "cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements" and "risk factors." actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements.
overview of business for a discussion about our businesses, business segments and our firm, see "item 1--business."
business environment market conditions global economic conditions. as a global investment firm, we are affected by financial and economic conditions globally. global and regional economic conditions have a substantial impact on our financial condition and results of operations, impacting the values of the investments we make, our ability to exit these investments profitably and our ability to make new investments. according to bureau of economic analysis as of february 2017, real gdp in the u.s. increased at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 1.6% for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to 2.6% for the year ended december 31, 2015. according to the bureau of labor statistics, the u.s. unemployment rate was 4.7% as of december 31, 2016, down from 5.0% as of december 31, 2015. for the year ended december 31, 2016, bloomberg estimates suggest that euro area real gdp growth was 1.6% on a year-over-year basis, compared to actual year-over-year growth of 2.0% in the prior year. on june 23, 2016, the united kingdom held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union, commonly referred to as "brexit." the referendum has resulted in significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the depreciation of many foreign currencies against the u.s. dollar. in addition, continuing controversy and uncertainty surrounding key issues such as immigration, austerity, and globalization and risk of countries exiting the european union continue to impair economic growth in the region and lead to financial market volatility. the united kingdom's decision to withdraw from the european union and the european union's inability to resolve other key issues could have adverse repercussions across financial markets, which could adversely affect valuations of our investments. on a year-over-year, seasonally adjusted basis, china's national bureau of statistics indicated that real gdp grew 6.7% in the year ended december 31, 2016, slightly less than the 6.9% reported for the year ended december 31, 2015. any future slowdown in china's growth could adversely impact the value of our investments in china. furthermore, slowing chinese growth could create dislocations in the global economy, particularly in other emerging markets where weaker chinese demand for imported commodities and finished goods could impact economic growth. in addition, the sharp correction and high volatility in china's stock market coupled with the devaluation of the chinese yuan may also adversely impact the value of our investments in china and make it more difficult to access capital in those markets. for a further discussion of how market conditions may affect our businesses, see "risk factors- risks related to our business - difficult market conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways, including by reducing the value or performance of the investments that we manage or by reducing the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital, each of which could negatively impact our net income and cash flow and adversely affect our financial condition."
global equity and credit markets. global equity and debt markets have a substantial effect on our financial condition and results of operations. in general, a climate of reasonable interest rates and high levels of liquidity in the debt and equity capital markets provide a positive environment for us to generate attractive investment returns in our funds that generate carry. periods of volatility and dislocation in the capital markets present substantial risks, but also can present us with opportunities to invest at reduced valuations that position us for future growth.
many of our investments are in equities, so a change in global equity prices or in market volatility directly impacts the value of our investments and our profitability as well as our ability to realize investment gains and the receptiveness of fund investors to our investment products. for the year ended december 31, 2016, global equity markets were positive, with the s&p 500 index up 12.0% and the msci world index up 8.2% on a total return basis including dividends. equity market volatility as evidenced by the chicago board options exchange market volatility index, or the vix, a measure of volatility, ended at 14.0 as of december 31, 2016, decreasing from 18.2 as of december 31, 2015. for a further discussion of our valuation methods, see "risk factors-risks related to the assets we manage - our investments are impacted by various economic conditions that are difficult to quantify or predict, and may have a significant impact on the valuation of our
99
investments and, therefore, on the investment income we realize and our financial condition and results of operations" and "-critical accounting policies-fair value measurements-level iii valuation methodologies" in this report.
many of our investments are also in credit instruments, and our funds and their portfolio companies also rely on credit financing and the ability to refinance existing debt. consequently, any decrease in the value of credit instruments that we have invested in or any increase in the cost of credit financing reduces our returns and decreases our net income. in particular due in part to holdings of credit instruments such as clos on our balance sheet, the performance of the credit markets has had an amplified impact on our financial results, as we directly bear the full extent of losses from credit instruments on our balance sheet. credit markets can also impact valuations because a discounted cash flow analysis is generally used as one of the methodologies used to ascertain the fair value of our investments that do not have readily observable market prices. in addition, with respect to our credit instruments, tightened credit spreads lead to an increase in the value of these investments, if not offset by hedging or other factors. in addition, credit spreads generally tightened throughout the year ended december 31, 2016. low interest rates related to monetary stimulus and economic stagnation also negatively impacts expected returns on all investments, as the demand for relatively higher return assets increases and supply decreases. higher interest rates in conjunction with slower growth or weaker currencies in some emerging market economies may cause the default risk of these countries to increase, and this could impact the operations or value of our investments that operate in these regions. areas such as the eurozone and japan, which have ongoing central bank quantitative easing campaigns and comparatively low interest rates relative to the united states, could potentially experience further currency volatility and weakness relative to the u.s. dollar. for a further discussion of how market conditions may affect our businesses, see "risk factors- risks related to our business - difficult market conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways, including by reducing the value or performance of the investments that we manage or by reducing the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital, each of which could negatively impact our net income and cash flow and adversely affect our financial condition" and "risks related to the assets we manage - our investments are impacted by various economic conditions that are difficult to quantify or predict, and may have a significant impact on the valuation of our investments and, therefore, on the investment income we realize and our financial condition and results of operations."
the subinvestment grade credit indices rose during the year ended december 31, 2016, with the s&p/lsta leveraged loan index up 10.2% and the boaml hy master ii index up 17.5%. for the year ended december 31, 2016, 10-year government bond yields rose 17 basis points in the united states, and rose 20 basis points in china and fell 22 basis points in japan and 42 basis points in germany. for further discussion of the impact of global credit markets on our financial condition and results of operations, see "risk factors - risks related to the assets we manage -changes in the debt financing markets may negatively impact the ability of our investment funds, their portfolio companies and strategies pursued with our balance sheet assets to obtain attractive financing for their investments or refinance existing debt and may increase the cost of such financing if it is obtained, which could lead to lower-yielding investments and potentially decrease our net income," "- our investments are impacted by various economic conditions that are difficult to quantify or predict, and may have a significant impact on the valuation of our investments and, therefore, on the investment income we realize and our financial condition and results of operations" and "- because we hold interests in some of our portfolio companies both through our management of private equity funds as well as through separate investments in those funds and direct co-investments, fluctuation in the fair values of these portfolio companies may have a disproportionate impact on the investment income earned by us" and "-critical accounting policies-fair value measurements-level iii valuation methodologies" in this report.
foreign exchange rates. foreign exchange rates have a substantial impact on the valuations of our investments that are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. currency volatility, which has become more pronounced in recent quarters, can also affect our businesses which deal in cross‐border trade. the u.s. dollar has appreciated against a number of currencies over recent periods, which is likely to cause a decrease in the u.s. dollar value of our non‐u.s. investments to the extent unhedged and making the exports of u.s. based companies less competitive leading to a decline in revenues. while this may cause a decrease in the u.s. dollar values of our existing assets and portfolio companies outside the united states, we also expect it to create opportunities to invest at more attractive u.s. dollar prices in certain countries. for the year ended december 31, 2016, the euro fell 3.2% and the british pound fell 16.3% respectively, relative to the u.s. dollar with significant depreciation following the june 23, 2016, referendum in which voters in the united kingdom approved an exit from the european union. the depreciation of the british pound adversely affects the value of our pound denominated investments, to the extent unhedged and adversely affects the dollar equivalent revenues of portfolio companies with substantial pound denominated revenues. see "risk factors- risks related to our business - difficult market conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways, including by reducing the value or performance of the investments that we manage or by reducing the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital, each of which could negatively impact our net income and cash flow and adversely affect our financial condition." in china, the potential for greater depreciation of china's currency, the yuan, remains a large source of uncertainty. the cumulative devaluation of the yuan since august 2015, which effectively makes chinese exports cheaper and imports more expensive, may impact global trade substantially for the reasons discussed above. for

additional information regarding our foreign exchange rate risk, see "quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk - exchange rate risk".
commodity markets. our private markets portfolio contains energy real asset investments and certain of our public markets strategies and products, including direct lending, special situations and clos, have meaningful investments in the energy sector. the value of these investments is heavily influenced by the price of natural gas and oil, which have varied over the course of the year. during the year ended december 31, 2016, the long-term price of wti crude increased approximately 13%, while the long-term price of natural gas was relatively stable. the long-term price of wti crude oil increased from approximately $50 per barrel to $56 per barrel, and the long-term price of natural gas decreased from approximately $2.90 per mcf to $2.87 per mcf as of december 31, 2015 and december 31, 2016, respectively. while commodity prices have increased over the course of the year, if commodity prices decline or if a decline is not offset by other factors, we would expect the value of our energy real asset investments to be adversely impacted. in addition, because we hold certain energy assets on our balance sheet, which had a fair value of $0.6 billion as of december 31, 2016, these price movements would have an amplified impact on our financial results, as we would directly bear the full extent of such gains or losses. for additional information regarding our energy real assets, see "-critical accounting policies-fair value measurements-level iii valuation methodologies-real asset investments" in this report and "risk factors - risks related to the assets we manage - because we hold interests in some of our portfolio companies both through our management of private equity funds as well as through separate investments in those funds and direct co-investments, fluctuation in the fair values of these portfolio companies may have a disproportionate impact on the investment income earned by us".
business conditions our segment revenues consist of fees, performance income and investment income. our ability to grow our revenues depends in part on our ability to attract new capital and investors, our successful deployment of capital including from our balance sheet and our ability to realize investments.
•   our ability to attract new capital and investors. our ability to attract new capital and investors in our funds is driven, in part, by the extent to which they continue to see the alternative asset management industry generally, and our investment products specifically, as an attractive vehicle for capital appreciation or income. since 2010, we have expanded into strategies such as energy, infrastructure, real estate, growth equity, credit and hedge funds. in several of these strategies, our first time funds have begun raising successor funds, and we expect the cost of raising such successor funds to be lower. we have also reached out to new clients, including retail and high net worth clients. however, fundraising continues to be competitive. while our flagship americas private equity fund exceeded the size of its predecessor fund, there is no assurance that fundraises for our other flagship private equity funds or for our newer strategies and their successor funds will experience similar success. if we are unable to successfully raise comparably sized or larger funds, our aum, fpaum and associated fees attributable to new capital raised in future periods may be lower than in prior years. new capital raised for the fiscal years ended december 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016 was $13.3 billion, $19.8 billion and $28.8 billion.
•   our ability to successfully deploy capital. our ability to maintain and grow our revenue base is dependent upon our ability to successfully deploy the capital available to us and participate in capital markets transactions. greater competition, high valuations, increased overall cost of credit and other general market conditions may impact our ability to identify and execute attractive investments. additionally, because we seek to make investments which have an ability to achieve our targeted returns while taking on a reasonable level of risk, we may experience periods of reduced investment activity. we have a long‐term investment horizon and the capital deployed in any one quarter may vary significantly from the capital deployed in any other quarter or the quarterly average of capital deployed in any given year. reduced levels of transaction activity also tends to result in reduced potential future investment gains, lower transaction fees and lower fees for our capital markets business, which may earn fees in the syndication of equity or debt. capital invested for the fiscal years ended december 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016 were $13.6 billion, $11.5 billion and $11.0 billion, and syndicated capital for the fiscal years ended december 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016 were $2.6 billion, $0.9 billion and $1.2 billion, such that 2014 reflects unusually high levels of activity for us on a historical basis.
•   our ability to realize investments. the strength and liquidity of the u.s. and relevant global equity markets generally, and the initial public offering market specifically affects the value of, and our ability to successfully exit, our equity positions in our private equity portfolio companies in a timely manner. we may also realize investments through strategic sales. for the fiscal years ended december 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, through exit activity in our investments, we realized carried interest of $1.2 billion, $1.0 billion and $1.3 billion. since december 31, 2016, we have
101
announced or closed the strategic sales or partial sales of panasonic healthcare co. ltd (healthcare sector), gland pharma limited (manufacturing sector), asia dairy holdings (consumer products sector),  capsugel (manufacturing sector), china greenland rundong auto group limited (hk: 1365) and tvs logistics services limited (services sector) and have completed secondary offerings for hca holdings, inc. (nyse: hca), galenica ag (vtx: galn), and us foods holding corp. (nyse: usfd). such sales and transactions, however, are episodic and reduced levels of sale activity in future quarters would reduce transaction fees, realized carry and distributions.
basis of accounting we consolidate the financial results of the kkr group partnerships and their consolidated subsidiaries, which include the accounts of our investment management and capital markets companies, the general partners of unconsolidated funds and vehicles, general partners of certain funds that are consolidated and their respective consolidated funds and certain other entities including certain consolidated clos and commercial real estate mortgage-backed securities, or "cmbs". we refer to clos and cmbs as collateralized financing entities or cfes.
on january 1, 2016, kkr adopted asu no. 2015-02, consolidation (topic 810): amendments to the consolidation analysis ("asu 2015-02"). the adoption of asu 2015-02 resulted in the de-consolidation of most of kkr's investment funds, but did not impact net income (loss) attributable to kkr & co. l.p. under gaap. kkr adopted this new guidance using the modified retrospective method. as a result, no retrospective adjustment is required and prior periods presented in this report under gaap have not been impacted.
when an entity is consolidated, we reflect the accounts of the consolidated entity, including its assets, liabilities, fees, expenses, investment income, cash flows and other amounts, on a gross basis. while the consolidation of a consolidated fund or entity does not have an effect on the amounts of net income attributable to kkr or kkr's partners' capital that kkr reports, the consolidation does significantly impact the financial statement presentation under gaap. this is due to the fact that the accounts of the consolidated entities are reflected on a gross basis while the allocable share of those amounts that are attributable to third parties are reflected as single line items. the single line items in which the accounts attributable to third parties are recorded are presented as noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of financial condition and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of operations. in connection with the adoption of asu 2015-02, and the resulting de-consolidation of most of our investment funds, kkr's financial statements under gaap no longer reflect the accounts of most of our investment funds and also reflect a significantly lower amount of noncontrolling interests and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. accordingly, the amounts associated with the individual financial statement captions may be substantially less than those presented in prior periods.
for a further discussion of our consolidation policies, see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data--summary of significant accounting policies."
key financial measures under gaap fees and other fees and other consist primarily of (i) transaction fees earned in connection with successful investment transactions and from capital markets activities, (ii) management and incentive fees from providing investment management services to unconsolidated funds, clos, other vehicles and separately managed accounts, (iii) monitoring fees from providing services to portfolio companies, (iv) carried interest allocations to general partners of unconsolidated funds, (v) revenue earned by oil and gas-producing entities that are consolidated and (vi) consulting fees earned by entities that employ non-employee operating consultants. these fees are based on the contractual terms of the governing agreements and are recognized when earned, which coincides with the period during which the related services are performed and in the case of transaction fees, upon closing of the transaction. monitoring fees may provide for a termination payment following an initial public offering or change of control. these termination payments are recognized in the period when the related transaction closes.
as indicated above, on january 1, 2016, kkr adopted asu 2015-02, which resulted in the de-consolidation of most of kkr's investment funds that had been consolidated prior to such date. management fees, fee credits and carried interest earned from consolidated funds are eliminated in consolidation and as such are not recorded in fees and other. the economic impact of these management fees, fee credits and carried interests that are eliminated is reflected as an adjustment to noncontrolling interests and has no impact to net income attributable to kkr & co. l.p. as a result of the de-consolidation of most of our investment funds, the management fees, fee credits and carried interests associated with funds that had previously been consolidated are included in fees and other beginning on january 1, 2016 as such amounts are no longer eliminated.
102
for a further discussion of our fee policies, see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data--summary of significant accounting policies."
expenses compensation and benefits compensation and benefits expense includes cash compensation consisting of salaries, bonuses, and benefits, as well as equity-based compensation consisting of charges associated with the vesting of equity-based awards, carry pool allocations and other performance-based income compensation. all employees and employees of certain consolidated entities receive a base salary that is paid by kkr or its consolidated entities, and is accounted for as compensation and benefits expense. these employees are also eligible to receive discretionary cash bonuses based on performance, overall profitability and other matters. while cash bonuses paid to most employees are borne by kkr and certain consolidated entities and result in customary compensation and benefits expense, cash bonuses that are paid to certain employees are currently borne by kkr holdings. these bonuses are funded with distributions that kkr holdings receives on kkr group partnership units held by kkr holdings but are not then passed on to holders of unvested units of kkr holdings. because employees are not entitled to receive distributions on units that are unvested, any amounts allocated to employees in excess of an employee's vested equity interests are reflected as employee compensation and benefits expense. these compensation charges are recorded based on the unvested portion of quarterly earnings distributions received by kkr holdings at the time of the distribution, but are adjusted to reflect actual payments expected to be made each year. because kkr makes only fixed quarterly distributions, the distributions made on kkr group partnership units underlying any unvested kkr holdings units are generally insufficient to fund annual cash bonus compensation to the same extent as in periods prior to the fourth quarter of 2015. in addition, substantially all units in kkr holdings have been allocated and will vest over a 5 year period, thus decreasing the amount of distributions received by kkr holdings that are available for annual cash bonus compensation. we, therefore, expect to pay an increasing portion and eventually all of the cash bonus payments currently borne by kkr holdings from other sources, including cash from our operations, the carry pool and other performance-based income compensation as described below. see "risks related to our business - if we cannot retain and motivate our principals and other key personnel and recruit, retain and motivate new principals and other key personnel, our business, results and financial condition could be adversely affected" regarding the adequacy of such distributions to fund future discretionary cash bonuses.
with respect to kkr's investment funds that provide for carried interest, kkr allocates 40% of the carried interest earned from such funds to its carry pool for employees and non-employee operating consultants. in addition, our carry pool is supplemented by allocating performance-based income to compensation equal to 40% of the incentive fees earned from investment funds that provide for incentive fees and, beginning with the quarter ended september 30, 2016, for investment funds that have a preferred return, also includes 40% of the management fees that would have been subject to a management fee refund. because of the different ways management fees are refunded in preferred return and non-preferred return funds, this calculation of 40% of the portion of the management fees subject to refund for funds that have a preferred return is designed to allocate to compensation an amount comparable to the amount that would have been allocated to the carry pool had the fund not had a preferred return. for a discussion of how management fees are refunded for preferred return funds and non-preferred funds see "--fair value measurements--recognition of carried interest in the statement of operations".
the amounts allocated to the carry pool and other performance-based income compensation are accounted for as compensatory profit-sharing arrangements and recorded as compensation and benefits expense for kkr employees and general, administrative and other expense for certain non-employee consultants and service providers in the consolidated statements of operations prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap.
general, administrative and other general, administrative and other expense consists primarily of professional fees paid to legal advisors, accountants, advisors and consultants, insurance costs, travel and related expenses, communications and information services, depreciation and amortization charges, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, expenses incurred by oil and gas-producing entities (including impairment charges) that are consolidated and other general and operating expenses which are not borne by fund investors and are not offset by credits attributable to fund investors' noncontrolling interests in consolidated funds. general, administrative and other expense also consists of costs incurred in connection with pursuing potential investments that do not result in completed transactions, a substantial portion of which are borne by fund investors.
103
investment income (loss)
net gains (losses) from investment activities on january 1, 2016, kkr adopted asu 2015-02, which resulted in the de-consolidation of most of kkr's investment funds that had been consolidated prior to such date. effective with the adoption of asu 2015-02, the net gains (losses) from investment activities attributed to third party limited partners in our investment funds that had previously been consolidated are no longer included in the statement of operations.
net gains (losses) from investment activities consist of realized and unrealized gains and losses arising from our investment activities. a large portion of our net gains (losses) from investment activities are related to our private equity investments. fluctuations in net gains (losses) from investment activities between reporting periods is driven primarily by changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as well as the realization of investments. the fair value of, as well as the ability to recognize gains from, our private equity and other investments is significantly impacted by the global financial markets, which, in turn, affects the net gains (losses) from investment activities recognized in any given period. upon the disposition of an investment, previously recognized unrealized gains and losses are reversed and an offsetting realized gain or loss is recognized in the current period. since our investments are carried at fair value, fluctuations between periods could be significant due to changes to the inputs to our valuation process over time. for a further discussion of our fair value measurements and fair value of investments, see "-critical accounting policies-fair value measurements."
dividend income dividend income consists primarily of distributions that we and our consolidated investment funds receive from portfolio companies in which they invest. dividend income is recognized primarily in connection with (i) dispositions of operations by portfolio companies, (ii) distributions of excess cash generated from operations from portfolio companies and (iii) other significant refinancings undertaken by portfolio companies.
on january 1, 2016, kkr adopted asu 2015-02, which resulted in the de-consolidation of most of kkr's investment funds that had been consolidated prior to such date. effective with the adoption of asu 2015-02, dividends received from our investment funds that had previously been consolidated are not included in the statement of operations.
interest income interest income consists primarily of interest that is received on our credit instruments in which we and our consolidated funds and other entities invest as well as interest on our cash balances and other investments.
on january 1, 2016, kkr adopted asu 2015-02, which resulted in the de-consolidation of most of kkr's investment funds that had been consolidated prior to such date. effective with the adoption of asu 2015-02, interest income received from our investment funds that had previously been consolidated is not included in the statement of operations.
interest expense on january 1, 2016, kkr adopted asu 2015-02, which resulted in the de-consolidation of most of kkr's investment funds that had been consolidated prior to such date. effective with the adoption of asu 2015-02, interest expense incurred by our investment funds that had previously been consolidated is not included in the statement of operations.
interest expense is incurred from debt issued by kkr, including debt issued by kfn which was consolidated upon completion of the acquisition of kfn, credit facilities entered into by kkr, debt securities issued by consolidated cfes and financing arrangements at our consolidated funds entered into primarily with the objective of managing cash flow. kfn's debt obligations are non-recourse to kkr beyond the assets of kfn. debt securities issued by consolidated cfes are supported solely by the investments held at the cfe and are not collateralized by assets of any other kkr entity. our obligations under financing arrangements at our consolidated funds are generally limited to our pro-rata equity interest in such funds. however, in some circumstances, we may provide limited guarantees of the obligations of our general partners in an amount equal to or in excess of our pro rata equity interest in such funds. our management companies bear no obligations with respect to financing arrangements at our consolidated funds. see "-liquidity".
104
income taxes the kkr group partnerships and certain of their subsidiaries operate in the united states as partnerships for u.s. federal income tax purposes and as corporate entities in non-u.s. jurisdictions. accordingly, these entities, in some cases, are subject to new york city unincorporated business taxes, or non-u.s. income taxes. furthermore, we hold our interest in one of the kkr group partnerships through kkr management holdings corp., which is treated as a corporation for u.s. federal income tax purposes, and certain other subsidiaries of the kkr group partnerships are treated as corporations for u.s. federal income tax purposes. accordingly, such subsidiaries of kkr, including kkr management holdings corp., and of the kkr group partnerships are subject to u.s. federal, state and local corporate income taxes at the entity level and the related tax provision attributable to kkr's share of this income is reflected in the financial statements. we also generate certain interest income to our unitholders and interest deductions to kkr management holdings corp.
we use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes in accordance with gaap. under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis using currently enacted tax rates. the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted. deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. significant judgment is required in determining tax expense and in evaluating tax positions including evaluating uncertainties. we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust our tax balances as new information becomes available.
net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the ownership interests that certain third parties hold in entities that are consolidated in the financial statements as well as the ownership interests in our kkr group partnerships that are held by kkr holdings. the allocable share of income and expense attributable to these interests is accounted for as net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. historically, the amount of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests has been substantial and has resulted in significant charges and credits in the statements of operations. however, on january 1, 2016, kkr adopted asu 2015-02, which resulted in the de-consolidation of most of kkr's investment funds that had been consolidated prior to such date. as a result of this adoption, the amount of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests is expected to be significantly lower than that reported in prior periods. however, given the consolidation of certain of our investment funds and the significant ownership interests in our kkr group partnerships held by kkr holdings, we expect a portion of net income (loss) will continue to be attributed to noncontrolling interests in our business.
segment operating and performance measures the segment key performance measures that follow are used by management in making operating and resource deployment decisions as well as assessing the overall performance of each of kkr's reportable business segments. the reportable segments for kkr's business are presented prior to giving effect to the allocation of income (loss) between kkr & co. l.p. and kkr holdings l.p. and as such represent the business in total. in addition, kkr's reportable segments are presented without giving effect to the consolidation of the investment funds and cfes that kkr manages as well as other consolidated entities that are not subsidiaries of kkr & co. l.p.
we disclose the following financial measures in this report that are calculated and presented using methodologies other than in accordance with gaap. we believe that providing these performance measures on a supplemental basis to our gaap results is helpful to unitholders in assessing the overall performance of kkr's businesses. these financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for similar financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap, if available. we caution readers that these non-gaap financial measures may differ from the calculations of other investment managers, and as a result, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other investment managers. reconciliations of these non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap, where applicable, are included within "financial statements and supplementary data - note 14. segment reporting" and later in this report under "-segment balance sheet."
105
adjusted units adjusted units are used as a measure of the total common equity ownership of kkr that is held by kkr & co. l.p. (including equity awards issued under the kkr & co. l.p. 2010 equity incentive plan, but excluding preferred units), kkr holdings and other holders of securities exchangeable into common units of kkr & co. l.p. and represent the fully diluted common unit count using the if-converted method. we believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides an indication of the total common equity ownership of kkr as if all outstanding kkr holdings units, equity awards issued under the equity incentive plan and other exchangeable securities had been exchanged for common units of kkr & co. l.p. the series a and series b preferred units are not exchangeable for common units of kkr & co. l.p.
adjusted units eligible for distribution adjusted units eligible for distribution represents the portion of total adjusted units that is eligible to receive a distribution. we believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides insight into the calculation of amounts available for distribution on a per unit basis. adjusted units eligible for distribution is used in the calculation of after-tax distributable earnings per unit.
after-tax distributable earnings after-tax distributable earnings is used by management as an operating measure of the earnings excluding mark-to-market gains (losses) of kkr. kkr believes this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides a supplemental measure to assess performance, excluding the impact of mark-to-market gains (losses). after-tax distributable earnings excludes certain realized investment losses to the extent unrealized losses on these investments were recognized prior to the combination with kpe on october 1, 2009. after-tax distributable earnings does not represent and is not used to calculate actual distributions under kkr's distribution policy.
the following table presents our after-tax distributable earnings on common units for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 as described above. for a discussion of the components that drove the changes in our distributable earnings, see"-segment analysis."

(1) amount includes a $100.0 million realized loss on a segment basis relating to the write-off of energy future holdings which had previously been marked at zero on an unrealized basis. accordingly, this write-off had no impact on our economic net income during the year ended december 31, 2015.
(2) amount includes a $253.7 million realized loss relating to samson resources which had previously been marked at zero on an unrealized basis. accordingly, this had no impact on our economic net income during the year ended december 31, 2016.
assets under management ("aum")
assets under management ("aum") represent the assets managed by kkr or by its strategic partners from which kkr is entitled to receive fees or a carried interest (either currently or upon deployment of capital) and general partner capital. we believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into kkr's capital raising activities and the overall activity in its investment funds and strategic partnerships. kkr calculates the amount of aum as of any date as the sum of: (i) the fair value of the investments of kkr's investment funds; (ii) uncalled capital commitments from these funds, including uncalled capital commitments from which kkr is currently not earning management fees or carried interest; (iii) the fair value of investments in kkr's co-investment vehicles; (iv) the par value of outstanding clos (excluding clos wholly-owned by kkr); (v) kkr's pro-rata portion of the aum managed by strategic partnerships in which kkr holds a minority ownership interest and (vi) the fair value of other assets managed by kkr. the pro-rata portion of the aum managed by strategic partnerships is calculated based on kkr's percentage ownership interest in such entities multiplied by such entity's respective aum. kkr's definition of aum is not based on any definition of aum that may be set forth in the agreements governing the investment funds, vehicles or accounts that it manages or calculated pursuant to any regulatory definitions.
book value book value is a measure of the net assets of kkr's reportable segments and is used by management primarily in assessing the unrealized value of kkr's investments and other assets, including carried interest. we believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into the assets and liabilities of kkr excluding the assets and liabilities that are allocated to noncontrolling interest holders and to the holders of the series a and series b preferred units.
107
capital invested capital invested is the aggregate amount of capital invested by (i) kkr's investment funds, (ii) kkr's principal activities segment as a co-investment, if any, alongside kkr's investment funds, and (iii) the principal activities segment in connection with a syndication transaction conducted by kkr's capital markets segment, if any.  capital invested is used as a measure of investment activity at kkr during a given period. we believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides a measure of capital deployment across kkr's business segments.  capital invested includes investments made using investment financing arrangements like credit facilities, as applicable.  capital invested excludes (i) investments in liquid credit strategies, (ii) capital invested by kkr's principal activities segment that is not a co-investment alongside kkr's investment funds, and (iii) capital invested by the principal activities segment that is not invested in connection with a syndication transaction by kkr's capital markets segment. capital syndicated by our capital markets segment to third parties other than kkr's investment funds or principal activities segment is not included in capital invested.  see also syndicated capital. in the fourth quarter of 2016, the capital invested metric was changed to include capital invested by kkr's principal activities segment and all prior periods in this report have been adjusted.
economic net income (loss) ("eni")
economic net income (loss) is a measure of profitability for kkr's reportable segments and is used by management as an alternative measurement of the operating and investment earnings of kkr and its business segments. we believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into the overall profitability of kkr's businesses inclusive of carried interest, incentive fees and related carry pool allocations and investment income. eni is comprised of total segment revenues less total segment expenses and certain economic interests in kkr's segments held by third parties. pre-tax economic net income (loss) represents economic net income (loss) after equity-based compensation. after-tax economic net income (loss) represents economic net income (loss) after equity-based compensation, provision for income taxes and preferred distributions.
fee paying aum ("fpaum")
fee paying aum represents only those assets under management of kkr or its strategic partners from which kkr receives management fees. we believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into the capital base upon which kkr earns management fees. fpaum is the sum of all of the individual fee bases that are used to calculate kkr's fees and differs from aum in the following respects: (i) assets and commitments from which kkr does not receive a fee are excluded (i.e. assets and commitments with respect to which it receives only carried interest or is otherwise not currently receiving a fee) and (ii) certain assets, primarily in its private equity funds, are reflected based on capital commitments and invested capital as opposed to fair value because fees are not impacted by changes in the fair value of underlying investments.
fee related earnings ("fre")
fee related earnings is a measure of the operating earnings of kkr and its business segments before performance income, related performance income compensation and investment income. kkr believes this measure may be useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into the operating profitability of kkr's fee generating management companies and capital markets businesses.
outstanding adjusted units outstanding adjusted units represents the portion of total adjusted units that would receive assets of kkr if it were to be liquidated as of a particular date. outstanding adjusted units is used to calculate book value per outstanding adjusted unit, which we believe is useful to unitholders as it provides a measure of net assets of kkr's reportable segments on a per unit basis.
syndicated capital syndicated capital is generally the aggregate amount of capital in transactions originated by kkr and its investment funds and carry-yielding co-investment vehicles, which has been distributed to third parties in exchange for a fee. it does not include (i) capital invested in such transactions by kkr investment funds and carry-yielding co-investment vehicles, which is instead reported in capital invested and (ii) debt capital that is arranged as part of the acquisition financing of transactions originated by kkr investment funds. syndicated capital is used as a measure of investment activity for kkr and its business segments during a given period, and we believe that this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into levels of syndication activity in kkr's capital markets segment and across its investment platform.
108
uncalled commitments uncalled commitments are used as a measure of unfunded capital commitments that kkr's investment funds and carry-paying co-investment vehicles have received from partners to contribute capital to fund future investments. we believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into the amount of capital that is available to kkr's investment funds to make future investments. uncalled commitments are not reduced for investments completed using fund-level investment financing arrangements.

consolidated results of operations the following is a discussion of our consolidated results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015. you should read this discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. for a more detailed discussion of the factors that affected the results of operations of our four business segments in these periods, see "-segment analysis." on january 1, 2016, kkr adopted asu no. 2015-02, consolidation (topic 810): amendments to the consolidation analysis ("asu 2015-02"). the adoption of asu 2015-02 resulted in the de-consolidation of most of kkr's investment funds, but did not impact net income (loss) attributable to kkr & co. l.p. kkr adopted this new guidance using the modified retrospective method. as a result, no retrospective adjustment is required and prior periods presented below have not been impacted.

on january 1, 2016, kkr adopted asu 2015-02, which resulted in the de-consolidation of most of kkr's investment funds that had been consolidated prior to such date. when an investment fund is consolidated, management fees, fee credits and carried interest earned from consolidated funds are eliminated in consolidation and as such are not recorded in fees and other. the economic impact of these management fees, fee credits and carried interests that are eliminated is reflected as an adjustment to noncontrolling interests and has no impact to net income attributable to kkr & co. l.p. as a result of the de-consolidation of most of our investment funds, the management fees, fee credits and carried interests associated with funds that had previously been consolidated are included in fees and other beginning on january 1, 2016 as such amounts are no longer eliminated. for a discussion of other factors that affected fees and other, see "--segment analysis."
the increases in carried interest, management fees and fee credits are primarily due to activity from funds that are no longer consolidated as described above. for a more detailed discussion of the factors that affected our carried interest, management fees and fee credits during the period, see "-segment analysis."
the carried interest gains earned during the year ended december 31, 2016 were due primarily to an overall increase in the value of our private equity portfolio. for a more detailed discussion of the factors that affected our private markets carried interest during the period, see "-segment analysis -- private markets -- segment revenues -- performance income."
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in monitoring fees in our private markets business as discussed in greater detail in "--segment analysis -- private markets -- segment revenues -- management, monitoring and transaction fees, net."
the decrease in oil and gas revenue was due primarily to lower production volumes and a lower price of oil in the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015.
compensation and benefits expenses the decrease was primarily due to lower carry pool allocations reflecting a lower level of appreciation in the value of our private equity portfolio during the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015.
general administrative and other expenses the decrease was primarily due to (i) a reduction in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability related to the acquisition of prisma from $46.6 million to zero since it was determined that it was no longer probable that the sellers (certain of whom are employees of kkr) of prisma would be entitled to any future additional payment under the arrangement, (ii) a decrease in the expenses of our consolidated oil and gas producing entities due to (a) a $54.0 million impairment charge incurred during the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to a $6.2 million charge incurred during the year ended december 31, 2016 and (b) a decrease in depreciation, depletion and amortization of our consolidated oil and gas producing entities caused by a lower cost basis due to previously recorded impairments and lower production volumes compared to the
111
prior period. these decreases were partially offset by (i) an increase in placement fees incurred in connection with capital raising activity, the most significant of which relates to americas fund xii and (ii) financing costs incurred relating to debt at new consolidated clos for which the fair value option has been elected.
net gains (losses) from investment activities on january 1, 2016, kkr adopted asu 2015-02, which resulted in the de-consolidation of most of kkr's investment funds that had been consolidated prior to such date. effective with the adoption of asu 2015-02, the net gains (losses) from investment activities attributed to third party limited partners in our investment funds that had previously been consolidated are not included in the statement of operations.

the net gains from investment activities for the year ended december 31, 2016 were comprised of net realized gains of $347.1 million and net unrealized losses of $(4.2) million. for the year ended december 31, 2016, net realized gains were comprised primarily of the net impact of (i) realized gains on sales of private equity investments held directly by kkr, including the partial sales of walgreens boots alliance, inc. (nasdaq: wba), zimmer biomet holdings, inc. (nyse: zbh). and hca holdings, inc. (nyse: hca); (ii) realized losses in connection with our investment in samson resources (energy sector); (iii) realized losses on assets held at consolidated clos and (iv) realized gains on debt held at consolidated clos. for the year ended december 31, 2016, net unrealized losses were driven primarily by (i) mark-to-market losses in our private equity portfolio held directly by kkr including unrealized losses in first data corporation (nyse: fdc), (ii) mark-to-market losses on assets in our consolidated special situations funds, (iii) mark-to-market losses on debt held through consolidated cmbs and (iv) the reversal of unrealized gains on the partial sales of walgreens boots alliance, inc., zimmer biomet holdings, inc. and hca holdings, inc., as well as the reversal of unrealized gains on debt realizations at our consolidated clos. offsetting these unrealized losses were unrealized gains, the most significant of which were unrealized gains relating to (i) the reversal of unrealized losses in connection with our investment in samson resources, (ii) reversals of unrealized losses on asset realizations in our consolidated clos and (iii) mark-to-market gains on investments held through consolidated cmbs structures. for a discussion of other factors that affected kkr's investment income, see "--segment analysis."
for the year ended december 31, 2015, the most significant driver of the net investment gains related to gains and losses at kkr's consolidated private equity funds as discussed in greater detail in "--segment analysis -- private markets -- segment revenues -- performance income."
dividend income on january 1, 2016, kkr adopted asu 2015-02, which resulted in the de-consolidation of most of kkr's investment funds that had been consolidated prior to such date. effective with the adoption of asu 2015-02, dividends received from our investment funds that had previously been consolidated are not included in the statement of operations.
the decrease was primarily due to a decrease associated with investment funds no longer being consolidated in the 2016 period as a result of the adoption of asu 2015-02. during the year ended december 31, 2016 significant dividends received included $51.5 million from our consolidated special situations funds and dividends from us foods holding corp. of $23.4 million, sedgwick claims management services (financial services sector) of $12.7 million and pra health sciences, inc. (nasdaq: prah) of $4.1 million. during the year ended december 31, 2015 we received dividends of $123.7 million from wmf (consumer products sector), $114.9 million from citic envirotech ltd. (sp: cel), $86.2 million from mmi holdings
112
limited (technology sector), $80.5 million from academy ltd. (retail sector), $65.9 million from aricent inc. (technology sector) and an aggregate of $379.3 million of dividends from other investments. significant dividends from portfolio companies are generally not recurring quarterly dividends, and while they may occur in the future, their size and frequency are variable. for a discussion of other factors that affected kkr's dividend income, see "--segment analysis."
interest income on january 1, 2016, kkr adopted asu 2015-02, which resulted in the de-consolidation of most of kkr's investment funds that had been consolidated prior to such date. effective with the adoption of asu 2015-02, interest income received from our investment funds that had previously been consolidated is not included in the statement of operations.
the decrease was primarily due to investment funds (primarily those that are credit-oriented) no longer being consolidated in the 2016 period as a result of the adoption of asu 2015-02. this decrease was partially offset by the consolidation of cmbs entities beginning in the second quarter of 2015 as well as interest earned on new cmbs loans acquired by kkr real estate finance trust inc. for a discussion of other factors that affected kkr's interest income, see "--segment analysis."
interest expense on january 1, 2016, kkr adopted asu 2015-02, which resulted in the de-consolidation of most of kkr's investment funds that had been consolidated prior to such date. effective with the adoption of asu 2015-02, interest expense incurred by our investment funds that had previously been consolidated is not included in the statement of operations.
the increase was primarily due to (i) the consolidation of cmbs entities beginning in the second quarter of 2015, (ii) increased cmbs borrowings by kkr real estate finance trust inc. and (iii) interest expense associated with certain notes issued by consolidated clos of kfn being called for redemption. third party clo subordinated note holders receive the residual interest after all other payments have been made and as a result of a paydown made in august 2016, kkr recorded interest expense of $59.9 million. in addition, an incremental $8.8 million of accelerated accretion of debt discounts was recorded in connection with the notes of this clo being called for redemption. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest expense associated with financing facilities at investment funds no longer being consolidated in the first half of 2016 as a result of the adoption of asu 2015-02 and to a lesser extent the redemption of kfn's 8.375% notes due 2041 in november 2016. for a discussion of other factors that affected kkr's interest expense, see "--segment analysis."
income (loss) before taxes the decrease for the year ended december 31, 2016, was due primarily to the adoption of asu 2015-02 which resulted in the de-consolidation of most of kkr's investments funds that had been consolidated prior to such date, as described above.
income taxes the decrease is due primarily to a lower level of fees earned by our management companies and a lower level of unrealized carried interest gains accrued by certain fund entities during the year ended december 31, 2016.
net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended december 31, 2016 relates primarily to net income attributable to kkr holdings l.p. representing its ownership interests in the kkr group partnerships and to those investment funds that we consolidate. the decrease from the prior period is due primarily to noncontrolling interests attributed to third party limited partners in our investment funds that had previously been consolidated, but which are not included in the statement of operations effective with the adoption of asu 2015-02 on january 1, 2016.
net income (loss) attributable to kkr & co. l.p.
the decrease for the year ended december 31, 2016, was due primarily to a lower level of investment income, carried interest and fee income attributable to kkr & co. l.p. as compared to the prior year.

fees and other the net decrease was primarily due to (i) an $87.5 million decrease in transaction fees, (ii) a $74.5 million decrease in revenues earned by consolidated oil and gas producing entities and (iii) a $34.3 million decrease in incentive fees. these decreases were partially offset by a $145.6 million increase in monitoring fees. the decrease in transaction fees was primarily attributable to a decrease in both our private markets segment and capital markets segment. in our private markets segment the decreases were primarily attributable to a decrease in the average fee earned on completed investments. during the year ended december 31, 2015, in our private markets segment there were 37 transaction fee-generating investments paying an average fee of $3.9 million compared to 33 transaction fee-generating investments paying an average fee of $6.5 million during the year ended december 31, 2014. transaction fees vary by investment based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are transaction size, the particular discussions as to the amount of the fees, the complexity of the transaction and kkr's role in the transaction. in our capital markets segment transaction fees decreased primarily due to a decrease in the number and size of capital markets transactions for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. we completed 116 capital markets transactions for the year ended december 31, 2015 of which 16 represented equity offerings and 100 represented debt offerings, as compared to 139 transactions for the year ended december 31, 2014 of which 15 represented equity offerings and 124 represented debt offerings. the decrease in revenue earned by consolidated oil and gas producing entities was primarily the result of a decrease in oil prices for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the prior period, and to a lesser extent, reduced production volumes that resulted from assets sold in the third and fourth quarters of 2014, partially offset by revenues of oil and gas producing entities of kfn, which was acquired on april 30, 2014. the
114
decrease in incentive fees was due primarily to a decrease in incentive fees received from kfn as a result of our acquisition of it on april 30, 2014, as incentive fees from kfn after that date were eliminated from segment results, as well as lower incentive fees in our hedge fund-of-funds platform and european credit platform driven by less favorable financial performance in the current year. the increase in monitoring fees was primarily the result of $198.8 million of monitoring fees received during 2015 from the termination of monitoring fee arrangements in connection with the initial public offering (ipo) or partial exits of first data corporation (nyse: fdc), walgreens boots alliance, inc. (nasdaq: wba), j.m. smucker company (nyse: sjm), zimmer biomet holdings, inc. (nyse: zbh) and godaddy, inc. (nyse: gddy) compared to approximately $23.2 million of such fees received during the year ended december 31, 2014. these types of termination payments may occur in the future; however, they are infrequent in nature and are generally correlated with ipo and other realization activity in our private equity portfolio. this increase in monitoring fees from termination payments was partially offset by a decrease in recurring monitoring fees of $46.1 million. the decrease in recurring monitoring fees was primarily the result of a decrease in the number of portfolio companies paying a monitoring fee and a decrease in the average size of the fee. for the year ended december 31, 2015, we had 43 portfolio companies that were paying an average monitoring fee of $1.5 million compared with 50 portfolio companies that were paying an average monitoring fee of $2.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. in future periods, we anticipate that recurring monitoring fees will continue to decrease as a result of realizations and other transactions such as initial public offerings, if not offset by additional portfolio companies paying recurring monitoring fees.
expenses the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in general administrative and other expense of $244.7 million and a decrease in compensation and benefits of $83.3 million. the decrease in general administrative and other expense was primarily attributable to (i) a lower level of impairment charges relating to long-lived assets at our consolidated oil and gas producing entities during the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014, (ii) a decrease in operating expenses of our consolidated oil and gas producing entities that resulted primarily from assets sold in the third and fourth quarters of 2014 and a reduction in depreciation in 2015 as a result of an impairment of the long-lived assets of these entities in the fourth quarter of 2014 and (iii) non-recurring amounts accrued for litigation in 2014. the decrease in compensation and benefits was due primarily to (i) lower carry pool allocations as a result of the recognition of a lower level of carried interest during the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014, (ii) lower equity-based compensation related to kkr holdings reflecting fewer kkr holdings units vesting for expense recognition purposes and a lower level of amounts allocated to principals in excess of such principal's vested equity interests. these decreases were partially offset by (i) an increase in cash compensation reflecting a higher level of fees which generally results in higher compensation expense and (ii) higher equity-based compensation relating primarily to additional equity grants under the equity incentive plan.

a significant driver of net gains (losses) from investment activities for the year ended december 31, 2015 was related to unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value in our private equity investments. the net increase in the value of our private markets portfolio was driven primarily by net unrealized gains of $1.8 billion, $1.5 billion and $0.9 billion in our 2006 fund, north america fund xi and asian fund ii, respectively.  for the year ended december 31, 2015, the value of our private equity investment portfolio increased 14.2%. this was comprised of a 19.5% increase in the share prices of various publicly held or publicly indexed investments and a 9.3% increase in value of our privately held investments. the most significant increases in share prices of various publicly held or publicly indexed investments were gains in walgreens boots alliance, inc., pra health sciences, inc. (nasdaq: prah) and godaddy, inc. these increases were partially offset by decreased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were rignet (nasdaq: rnet), hca holdings, inc. (nyse: hca) and citic envirotech ltd. (sp: cel). subsequent to december 31, 2015, world equity markets declined sharply with both the s&p 500 and the msci world index down on a total return basis, including dividends, as of february 22, 2016. see "--business environment". our privately held investments contributed the remainder of the change in value, the most significant of which were gains relating to panasonic healthcare co. ltd (healthcare sector), capital safety group (industrial sector) and alliant insurance services (financial services sector). the unrealized gains on our privately held investments were partially offset by unrealized losses relating primarily to bis industries ltd. (industrial sector), acteon group ltd (energy sector) and aceco ti s.a. (technology sector). the increased valuations of individual companies in our privately held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) in the case of capital safety group and alliant insurance services, valuations that reflect agreements to sell these investments in whole or in part, (ii) an increase in the value of market comparables and (iii) individual company performance. the decreased valuations of individual companies in our privately held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) individual company performance or, in certain cases, an unfavorable business outlook and (ii) a decrease in the value of market comparables.
a significant driver of net gains (losses) from investment activities for the year ended december 31, 2014 was related to unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value in our private equity investments. the net unrealized investment gains in our private equity portfolio were driven primarily by net unrealized gains of $2.2 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion in our 2006 fund, european fund iii and north america fund xi, respectively. approximately 23% of the net change in value for the year ended december 31, 2014 was attributable to changes in share prices of various publicly-listed investments, the most significant of which were gains on pra health sciences, inc., hca holdings, inc., nxp semiconductors n.v. (nasdaq: nxpi) and yageo corporation (tw: 2327). these increases were partially offset by decreased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were tarkett s.a. (pa: tktt), prosiebensat.1 media ag (xetra: psm) and china greenland rundong auto group ltd (hk: 1365). our privately‐held investments contributed the remainder of the change in value, the most significant of which were gains relating to alliance boots gmbh (healthcare sector), biomet, inc. (healthcare sector) and wild flavors gmbh (consumer products sector). the unrealized gains on our privately‐held investments were partially offset by unrealized losses relating primarily to northgate information solutions (technology sector), samson resources (energy sector) and toys r us (retail sector). the unrealized gains were also offset by unrealized losses in our energy assets from our natural resources fund and energy income and growth fund of approximately $352 million. the increased valuations of individual companies in our privately‐held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) an increase in the value of market comparables and individual company performance, (ii) in the case of wild
116
flavors gmbh and biomet, inc., an increase that primarily reflected agreements to sell these investments, with the sale of wild flavors gmbh completed in october 2014, and (iii) in the case of alliance boots gmbh, primarily due to an agreement to exit the investment and to a lesser extent an increase in the value of a publicly traded stock that was expected to be delivered pursuant to this agreement, which was completed on december 31, 2014. the decreased valuations of individual companies in our privately‐held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to individual company performance or, in certain cases, an unfavorable business outlook. the decreased valuation of energy assets are generally related to decreases in commodity prices.
dividend income during the year ended december 31, 2015 we received dividends of $123.7 million from wmf (consumer products sector), $114.9 million from citic envirotech ltd., $86.2 million from mmi holdings limited (technology sector), $80.5 million from academy ltd. (retail sector), $65.9 million from aricent inc. (technology sector) and an aggregate of $379.3 million of dividends from other investments. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we received dividends of $178.6 million from visma (technology sector), $171.6 million from capsugel (manufacturing sector), $162.1 million from capital safety group, $87.7 million from wmf and an aggregate of $574.5 million of dividends from other investments. significant dividends from portfolio companies are generally not recurring quarterly dividends, and while they may occur in the future, their size and frequency are variable.
interest income the increase was primarily due to a net increase in (i) the amount of credit instruments in our consolidated public markets investment vehicles, including growth in our clo platform when compared to the prior period, (ii) the consolidation of cmbs entities beginning in the second quarter of 2015, and (iii) the acquisition of kfn on april 30, 2014 which did not contribute to our interest income for the first four months of 2014.
interest expense the increase was primarily due to (i) increased interest expense in connection with the growth of our clo platforms, the majority of which are consolidated, (ii) interest expense on our 2044 senior notes issued on may 29, 2014 and an additional issuance of such notes on march 18, 2015, (iii) increased interest expense related to financing facilities entered into by our consolidated investment funds for purposes of financing their operating and investing activities, (iv) the consolidation of cmbs entities beginning in the second quarter of 2015 and (v) the acquisition of kfn on april 30, 2014 which did not contribute to our interest expense for the first four months of 2014.
income (loss) before taxes the decrease was primarily due to lower investment income and lower fees and other, partially offset by lower expenses, as described above.
income tax (benefit)
income taxes for the year ended december 31, 2015 remained largely unchanged from the year ended december 31, 2014.  because certain investment funds owned by the kkr group partnerships are subject to corporate taxes, unrealized losses recognized by those funds during 2015 offset an increase in kkr & co. l.p.'s weighted average ownership percentage in the kkr group partnerships, which increased from approximately 49.5% for the year ended december 31, 2014 to approximately 54.9% for the year ended december 31, 2015.  the increase in ownership, primarily the result of exchanges of units in kkr holdings for kkr common units during 2015, subjects a greater level of income to corporate taxes.
net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and appropriated capital the decrease was primarily driven by lower investment income as described above and a decrease in kkr holdings' weighted average ownership percentage in the kkr group partnerships from approximately 50.5% for the year ended december 31, 2014 to approximately 45.1% for the year ended december 31, 2015. this decrease in ownership percentage is primarily due to exchanges of units in kkr holdings for kkr common units during the year.

net income (loss) attributable to kkr & co. l.p.
net income attributable to kkr & co l.p. for the year ended december 31, 2015 remained largely unchanged from the year ended december 31, 2014 due to the net impact of lower investment income as described above, which was offset by an increase in kkr & co. l.p's weighted average ownership percentage in the kkr group partnerships from approximately 49.5% for the year ended december 31, 2014 to approximately 54.9% for the year ended december 31, 2015.

consolidated statement of cash flows the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of our consolidated entities which include certain consolidated investment funds and cfes notwithstanding the fact that we may hold only a minority economic interest in those funds and cfes.
on january 1, 2016, kkr adopted asu 2015-02 which resulted in the de-consolidation of most of kkr's investment funds. kkr adopted this new guidance using the modified retrospective method. as a result, no retrospective adjustment is required and prior periods discussed below have not been impacted.
the assets of our consolidated funds and cfes, on a gross basis, can be substantially larger than the assets of our business and, accordingly, could have a substantial effect on the cash flows reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows. the primary cash flow activities of our consolidated funds and cfes involve: (i) capital contributions from fund investors; (ii) using the capital of fund investors to make investments; (iii) financing certain investments with indebtedness; (iv) generating cash flows through the realization of investments; and (v) distributing cash flows from the realization of investments to fund investors. because our consolidated funds and cfes are treated as investment companies for accounting purposes, certain of these cash flow amounts are included in our cash flows from operations.
net cash provided by (used in) operating activities our net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $(1.6) billion, $0.4 billion and $1.5 billion during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. these amounts primarily included: (i) proceeds from sales of investments net of purchases of investments of $(1.2) billion, $(0.7) billion and $1.0 billion during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively; (ii) net realized gains (losses) on investments of $0.3 billion, $3.0 billion and $5.4 billion during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively; and (iii) change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments of $(4.2) million, $1.7 billion and $(0.7) billion during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. investment funds are, for gaap purposes, investment companies and reflect their investments and other financial instruments at fair value.
net cash provided by (used in) investing activities our net cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(62.5) million, $(425.2) million and $(22.9) million during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. our investing activities included: (i) a change in restricted cash and cash equivalents (that primarily funds collateral requirements) of $1.4 million, $(164.6) million and $(10.8) million during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively; (ii) the purchases of fixed assets of $(62.7) million, $(169.4) million and $(12.2) million during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively; (iii) proceeds from sales of oil and natural gas properties, net of development of oil and natural gas properties of $(1.3) million, $(91.1) million and $(151.4) million for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively; and (iv) net of cash acquired of $151.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2014.
net cash provided by (used in) financing activities our net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $3.1 billion, $0.2 billion and $(1.9) billion during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. our financing activities primarily included: (i) distributions to, net of contributions by, our noncontrolling and redeemable noncontrolling interests of $0.9 billion, $(7.0) billion and $(2.7) billion during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively; (ii) proceeds received net of repayment of debt obligations of $2.4 billion, $8.1 billion and $1.7 billion during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively; (iii) distributions to our partners of $(285.4) million, $(706.6) million and $(785.0) million during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively; (iv) net delivery of common units of $(50.5) million, $15.2 million and $(8.8) million during the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively; (v) unit repurchases of $(296.8) million and $(161.9) million during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015; (vi) issuance of preferred units of $482.6 million during the year ended december 31, 2016 and (vii) preferred units distributions of $(22.2) million during the year ended december 31, 2016.

segment analysis the following is a discussion of the results of our four reportable business segments for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. you should read this discussion in conjunction with the information included under "-basis of financial presentation-segment operating and performance measures" and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.
as of december 31, 2015, kkr's management reevaluated the manner in which it made operational and resource deployment decisions and assessed the overall performance of each of kkr's operating segments. as a result, as of december 31, 2015, kkr modified the presentation of its segment financial information relative to the presentation in prior periods. in addition, since becoming a public company, our principal activities assets have grown in significance and are a meaningful contributor to our financial results.
certain of the more significant changes between kkr's current segment presentation and its segment presentation reported prior to december 31, 2015, are described in the following commentary.
inclusion of a fourth segment all income (loss) on investments is attributed to the principal activities segment. prior to december 31, 2015, income on investments held directly by kkr was reported in the private markets segment, public markets segment or capital markets segment based on the character of the income generated. for example, income from private equity investments was previously included in the private markets segment. however, the financial results of acquired businesses and strategic partnerships have been reported in our other segments.
expense allocations as of december 31, 2015, we have changed the manner in which expenses are allocated among our operating segments. specifically, as described below, (i) a portion of expenses, except for broken deal expenses, previously reflected in our private markets, public markets or capital markets segments are now reflected in the principal activities segment and (ii) corporate expenses are allocated across all segments.
expenses allocated to principal activities a portion of our cash compensation and benefits, occupancy and related charges and other operating expenses previously included in the private markets, public markets and capital markets segments is now allocated to the principal activities segment. the principal activities segments incurs its own direct costs, and an allocation from the other segments is also made to reflect the estimated amount of costs that are necessary to operate our principal activities segment, which are incremental to those costs incurred directly by the principal activities segment. the total amount of expenses (other than its direct costs) that is allocated to principal activities is based on the proportion of revenue earned by principal activities, relative to other operating segments, over the preceding four calendar years. this allocation percentage is updated annually or more frequently if there are material changes to our business. the method for expense allocation to be used in 2017 to allocate expense to the principal activities segment is currently being re-evaluated, and the percentage used to allocate such expenses for 2017 has currently not been determined. below is a summary of the allocation to principal activities, relative to other operating segments, for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:
•   2016 allocation: 22.6%, based on revenues earned in 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012
•   2015 allocation: 25.4%, based on revenues earned in 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011
•   2014 allocation: 31.7%, based on revenues earned in 2013, 2012, 2011 and 2010
once the total amount of expense to be allocated to the principal activities segment is estimated for each reporting period, the amount of this expense will be allocated from the private markets, public markets and capital markets segments based on the proportion of headcount in each of these three segments.
120
allocations of corporate overhead corporate expenses are allocated to each of the private markets, public markets, capital markets and principal activities segments based on the proportion of revenues earned by each segment over the preceding four calendar years. in our segment presentation reported prior to december 31, 2015, all corporate expenses were allocated to the private markets segment. below is a summary of the allocations to each of our operating segments for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

principal activities                       22.6               %                 25.4               %                 31.7               %

based on revenue earned in          2015, 2014, 2013 &amp; 2012          2014, 2013, 2012 &amp; 2011          2013, 2012, 2011 &amp; 2010
in connection with these modifications, segment information for the year ended december 31, 2014 has been presented in this annual report on form 10-k in conformity with kkr's current segment presentation. consequently, this information will not be consistent with historical segment financial results previously reported. while the modified segment presentation impacted the amount of economic net income reported by each operating segment, it had no impact on kkr's economic net income on a total reportable segment basis.

segment revenues management, monitoring and transaction fees, net the net decrease was primarily due to a decrease in monitoring fees of $200.3 million and a decrease in transaction fees of $12.1 million, partially offset by a corresponding decrease in fee credits of $91.4 million. the decrease in monitoring fees was primarily the result of $198.8 million of fees received during 2015 from the termination of monitoring agreements in connection with the exits or partial exits of the following (i) alliance boots gmbh, which was acquired by walgreens co. and renamed walgreens boots alliance, inc. (nasdaq: wba) subsequent to the acquisition, (ii) big heart pet brands (consumer products sector), (iii) biomet, inc., which was acquired by zimmer holdings inc. and renamed zimmer biomet holdings, inc. (nyse: zbh) subsequent to its acquisition, (iv) the ipo of go daddy inc. (nyse: gddy) and (v) the ipo of first data corporation (nyse: fdc) compared to $15.3 million of such termination payments during the year ended december 31, 2016 in connection with the ipo of us foods holding corp. (nyse: usfd). the level of termination payments that were realized in 2015 and in certain other historical periods are not expected to recur in future periods, because current monitoring agreements generally provide for smaller termination payments than have been provided for in such historical periods. termination payments may recur in future periods but are infrequent in nature and are generally correlated with ipo and other realization activity in our private equity portfolio. in addition, recurring monitoring fees decreased $16.8 million as a result of a decrease in the average size of the fee paid by the portfolio companies. for the year ended december 31, 2016, we had 53 portfolio companies that were paying an average monitoring fee of $0.9 million compared with 52 portfolio companies that were paying an average monitoring fee of $1.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. the decrease in transaction fees was primarily attributable to a decrease in both the number and size of transaction fee generating investments. during the year ended december 31, 2016, there were 35 investments that paid an average fee of $3.8 million compared to 37 transaction fee-generating investments paying an average fee of $3.9 million during the year ended december 31, 2015. transaction fees vary by investment based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are transaction size, the particular discussions as to the amount of the fees, the complexity of the transaction and kkr's role in the transaction. the decrease in fee credits is due primarily to a lower level of monitoring fees. the increase in management fees was primarily due to an increase in capital raised in global infrastructure investors ii and real estate partners europe as well as more capital earning a fee in european fund iv during 2016 as such fund was continuing its capital raising efforts in 2015. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in management fees attributable to lower invested capital in our 2006 fund, european fund ii and asian fund as a result of realizations. on january 1, 2017, americas fund xii commenced its investment period and north america fund xi entered its post investment period, the net effect of which is expected to be an increase in management fees by approximately $90 million in 2017 if not offset by other factors. on a segment basis, placement fees incurred in connection with capital raising activity are amortized as a reduction of revenues. see also discussion under "- assets under management" and "- fee-paying assets under management".
performance income the net decrease is attributable to a lower level of carried interest primarily reflecting a lower level of net appreciation in value of our private equity portfolio compared to the prior period.
realized carried interest for the year ended december 31, 2016 consisted primarily of realized gains from the sale or partial sale of walgreens boots alliance, inc., alliance tire group b.v. (manufacturing sector) and hca holdings, inc.
realized carried interest for the year ended december 31, 2015 consisted primarily of realized gains from the sales or partial sales of walgreens boots alliance, inc., capital safety group and zimmer biomet holdings, inc.

(1) the above table excludes any funds for which there was no unrealized carried interest during either of the periods presented.
for the year ended december 31, 2016, the net unrealized carried interest loss of $(416.1) million included $712.2 million representing net increases in the value of various portfolio companies, and net unrealized losses of $(1,128.3) million primarily representing reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains in connection with the occurrence of realization events such as partial or full sales and management fee refunds.
for the year ended december 31, 2016, the value of our private equity investment portfolio increased 11.9%. this was comprised of a 3.9% increase in the share prices of various publicly held or publicly indexed investments and an 18.4% increase in value of our privately held investments. the most significant increases in share prices of various publicly held or publicly indexed investments were gains in us foods holding corp. (nyse: usfd), pra health sciences inc. (nasdaq: prah) and hca holdings, inc. these increases were partially offset by decreased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were losses in first data corporation (nyse:fdc), walgreens boots alliance, inc. (nyse:wba) and qingdao haier (ch: 600690). our privately held investments contributed the remainder of the change in value, the most significant of which were gains relating to panasonic healthcare co. ltd, capsugel (manufacturing) and sedgwick claims management services. the unrealized gains on our privately held investments were partially offset by unrealized losses relating primarily to aricent group (technology sector), oeg management partners limited (energy sector) and academy ltd. (retail sector). the increased valuations of individual companies in our privately held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) in the case of panasonic healthcare co. ltd, capsugel and sedgwick claims management services, valuations that reflect agreements to sell all or a portion of these investments, (ii) an increase in the value of market comparables and (iii) individual company performance. the decreased valuations of individual companies in our privately held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) individual company performance or, in certain cases, an unfavorable business outlook and (ii) a decrease in the value of market comparables.
in addition to the agreements to sell a portion of panasonic healthcare co. ltd, and all of capsugel, as indicated above, realization activity such as dividends and agreements to sell, including partial sales and secondary sales, subsequent to december 31, 2016 are expected, certain of which are subject to closing conditions, with respect to the following private equity portfolio companies: asia dairy holdings, galenica ag, gland pharma limited, hca holdings, inc., china greenland rundong auto group limited, tvs logistics services limited, u.s. foods holding corp., and national vision, inc. (retail sector).
124
the reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains for the year ended december 31, 2016 resulted primarily from the sale or partial sales of walgreens boots alliance, alliance tire group b.v. and hca holdings, inc. during the year ended december 31, 2016, we recognized realized losses on samson resources (energy sector). this recognition of realized losses did not have a significant impact on our 2016 net carried interest because this investment had already been written down to zero value in prior periods. see "--segment analysis--principal activities segment" and "see "--segment analysis--principal activities segment" and "--segment operating and performance measures--after-tax distributable earnings" for a discussion of how our samson resources investment impacted principal activities and our distributable earnings.
for the year ended december 31, 2015, the net unrealized carried interest income of $182.6 million included $1,021.5 million representing net increases in the value of various portfolio companies, which were partially offset by unrealized losses of $838.9 million primarily representing reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains in connection with the occurrence of realization events such as partial or full sales and management fee refunds.
for the year ended december 31, 2015, the value of our private equity investment portfolio increased 14.2%. this was comprised of a 19.5% increase in the share prices of various publicly held or publicly indexed investments and a 9.3% increase in value of our privately held investments. the most significant increases in share prices of various publicly held or publicly indexed investments were gains in walgreens boots alliance, inc., pra health sciences, inc. (nasdaq: prah) and godaddy, inc. these increases were partially offset by decreased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were rignet (nasdaq: rnet), hca holdings, inc. (nyse: hca) and citic envirotech ltd. subsequent to december 31, 2015, world equity markets declined sharply with both the s&p 500 and the msci world index down on a total return basis, including dividends, as of february 22, 2016. see "--business environment". our privately held investments contributed the remainder of the change in value, the most significant of which were gains relating to panasonic healthcare co. ltd (healthcare sector), capital safety group (industrial sector) and alliant insurance services (financial services sector). the unrealized gains on our privately held investments were partially offset by unrealized losses relating primarily to bis industries ltd. (industrial sector), acteon group ltd (energy sector) and aceco ti s.a. (technology sector). the increased valuations of individual companies in our privately held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) in the case of capital safety group and alliant insurance services, valuations that reflect agreements to sell these investments in whole or in part, (ii) an increase in the value of market comparables and (iii) individual company performance. the decreased valuations of individual companies in our privately held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) individual company performance or, in certain cases, an unfavorable business outlook and (ii) a decrease in the value of market comparables.
the reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains for the year ended december 31, 2015 resulted primarily from the sale or partial sales of walgreens boots alliance, inc., capital safety group and zimmer biomet holdings, inc. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we wrote off energy future holdings (energy sector) and recognized realized losses. this write-off did not have a significant impact on our 2015 net carried interest because this investment had already been written down to zero value in prior periods. see "--segment analysis--principal activities segment" and "--segment operating and performance measures--after-tax distributable earnings" for a discussion of how the energy future holdings write-off impacted principal activities and our distributable earnings.
segment expenses compensation and benefits the net decrease was due primarily to lower net performance income compensation resulting from a lower level of appreciation in value of our private equity portfolio as described above.
occupancy and other operating expenses the increase is due to a higher level of expenses that are creditable to our investment funds and information technology related expenses.
economic net income (loss)
the decrease was primarily due to the lower levels of performance income and reduction in monitoring fees partially offset by the decrease in segment expenses as described above.

aum for the private markets segment was $73.8 billion at december 31, 2016, an increase of $7.8 billion, compared to $66.0 billion at december 31, 2015. the increase was primarily attributable to new capital raised primarily in our americas fund xii, kkr real estate finance trust inc., our next generation technology growth fund and, to a lesser extent, an increase in the value of our private markets portfolio. these increases were offset by distributions to private markets fund investors primarily as a result of realizations most notably in our 2006 fund, asian fund, and european fund iii.
the increase in the value of our private markets portfolio was driven primarily by net gains of $1.4 billion in our north american fund xi, $1.0 billion in our 2006 fund and $0.9 billion in our european fund iii.  the drivers of the overall change in value for private markets were a 3.9% increase in the share prices of various publicly held or publicly indexed investments and an 18.4% increase in value of our privately held investments. the most significant increases in share prices of various publicly held or publicly indexed investments were gains in us foods holding corp. (nyse: usfd), pra health sciences inc. (nasdaq: prah) and hca holdings, inc. these increases were partially offset by decreased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were losses in first data corporation (nyse:fdc), walgreens boots alliance, inc. (nyse:wba) and qingdao haier (ch: 600690). our privately held investments contributed the remainder of the change in value, the most significant of which were gains relating to panasonic healthcare co. ltd, capsugel (manufacturing) and sedgwick claims management services. the unrealized gains on our privately held investments were partially offset by unrealized losses relating primarily to aricent group (technology sector), oeg management partners limited (energy sector) and academy ltd. (retail sector). the increased valuations of individual companies in our privately held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) in the case of panasonic healthcare co. ltd, capsugel and sedgwick claims management services, valuations that reflect agreements to sell all or a portion of these investments, (ii) an increase in the value of market comparables and (iii) individual company performance. the decreased valuations of individual companies in our privately held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) individual company performance or, in certain cases, an unfavorable business outlook and (ii) a decrease in the value of market comparables.
certain investments included in our aum are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. those investments expose our aum to the risk that the value of the investments will be affected by changes in exchange rates between the currency in which the investments are denominated and the currency in which the investments are made. our policy is to minimize these risks in certain cases by employing hedging techniques, including using foreign currency options and foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce exposure to changes in exchange rates when a meaningful amount of capital has been invested in currencies other than the currencies in which the investments are denominated. we do not, however, hedge our currency exposure in all currencies or all investments. see "-quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk -- exchange rate risk" and "risk factors-risks related to the assets we manage--we make investments in companies that are based outside of the united states, which may expose us to additional risks not typically associated with investing in companies that are based in the united states."

126
fpaum in our private markets segment was $52.2 billion at december 31, 2016, an increase of $6.9 billion, compared to $45.3 billion at december 31, 2015. the increase was primarily attributable to new capital raised in our americas fund xii, real estate partners europe, kkr real estate finance trust inc., and next generation technology growth fund. these increases were partially offset by distributions and other activity and net changes in the fee base of certain funds. distributions and other activity primarily related to (i) realizations in our 2006 fund, asian fund and european fund iii and (ii) the termination of a management fee agreement with respect to one client. the decreases related to net changes in fee base primarily relates to our north america fund xi entering its post-investment period during which it earns fees based on invested capital rather than committed capital. additionally, upon entering its post-investment period, north america fund xi has established a reserve on its fund investors' capital commitments on which no fee is paid unless such capital is invested. uncalled capital commitments from investment funds from which kkr is currently not earning management fees amounted to approximately $6.7 billion at december 31, 2016, which includes capital commitments reserved for follow-on investments for funds that have completed their investment periods.  this capital will generally begin to earn management fees upon deployment of the capital or upon the commencement of the fund's investment period.  the average annual management fee rate associated with this capital is approximately 0.9%.  we will not begin earning fees on this capital until it is deployed or the related investment period commences, neither of which is guaranteed.  if and when such management fees are earned, which will occur over an extended period of time, a portion of existing fpaum may cease paying fees or pay lower fees, thus offsetting a portion of any new management fees earned. on january 1, 2017, americas fund xii commenced its investment period and north america fund xi entered its post investment period, the net effect of which is expected to be an increase in management fees in 2017 if not offset by other factors.
capital invested for the year ended december 31, 2016, capital invested in our private equity platform increased from $4.6 billion in the prior year to $5.1 billion in the current year. this increase was partially offset by a decrease in capital invested in our real assets and other platforms which decreased from $1.7 billion in the prior year to $1.2 billion in the current year. generally, the portfolio companies acquired through our private equity funds have higher transaction values and result in higher capital invested relative to transactions in our real assets funds. the number of large private equity investments made in any quarter is volatile and consequently, a significant amount of capital invested in one quarter or a few quarters may not be indicative of a similar level of capital deployment in future quarters. as of february 9, 2017, our private markets business had announced transactions that were subject to closing which aggregated approximately $3.0 billion. transactions subject to closing are subject to closing conditions which, if not satisfied, would result in a transaction not being consummated.
uncalled commitments as of december 31, 2016, our private markets segment had $31.5 billion of remaining uncalled capital commitments that could be called for investments in new transactions. the increase is due primarily to new capital raised in americas fund xii, partially offset by capital called from fund investors to fund investments during the period.

segment revenues management, monitoring and transaction fees, net the net increase was primarily due to an increase in monitoring fees of $129.5 million and an increase in management fees of $12.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in transaction fees of $70.0 million. the increase in monitoring fees was primarily the result of $198.8 million of monitoring fees received during 2015 from the termination of monitoring fee arrangements in connection with the initial public offering (ipo) or partial exits of first data corporation (nyse: fdc), walgreens boots alliance, inc. (nasdaq: wba), j.m. smucker company (nyse: sjm), zimmer biomet holdings, inc. (nyse: zbh) and godaddy, inc. (nyse: gddy) compared to approximately $23.2 million of such fees received during the year ended december 31, 2014. these types of termination payments may occur in the future; however, they are infrequent in nature and are generally correlated with ipo and other realization activity in our private equity portfolio. this increase in monitoring fees from termination payments was partially offset by a decrease in recurring monitoring fees of $46.1 million. the decrease in recurring monitoring fees was primarily the result of a decrease in the number of portfolio companies paying a monitoring fee and a decrease in the average size of the fee. for the year ended december 31, 2015, we had 43 portfolio companies that were paying an average monitoring fee of $1.5 million compared with 50 portfolio companies that were paying an average monitoring fee of $2.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2014. in future periods, we anticipate that recurring monitoring fees will continue to decrease as a result of realizations and other transactions such as initial public offerings, if not offset by additional portfolio companies paying recurring monitoring fees. the increase in management fees was primarily due to new capital raised in european fund iv and global infrastructure investors ii offset by a decrease in management fees attributable to lower invested capital in our european fund ii, 2006 fund and european fund iii as a result of realizations. see also discussion under "- assets under management" and "- fee-paying assets under management". the decrease in transaction fees was primarily attributable to a decrease in the average fee earned on completed investments during the year ended december 31, 2015. during the year ended december 31, 2015, there were 37 transaction fee-generating investments paying an average fee of $3.9 million compared to 33 transaction fee-generating investments paying an average fee of $6.5 million during the year ended december 31, 2014. transaction fees vary by investment based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are transaction size, the particular discussions as to the amount of the fees, the complexity of the transaction and kkr's role in the transaction.
performance income the net decrease is attributable to lower net carried interest losses primarily resulting from a lower level of investment gains at carry earning funds during the current period.
realized carried interest for the year ended december 31, 2015 consisted primarily of realized gains from the sales or partial sale of walgreens boots alliance, inc., capital safety group and zimmer biomet holdings, inc.
realized carried interest for the year ended december 31, 2014 consisted primarily of realized gains from the sales of oriental brewery (consumer products sector), wild flavors gmbh and versatel gmbh (telecom sector).

for the year ended december 31, 2015, the net unrealized carried interest income of $182.6 million included $1,021.5 million representing net increases in the value of various portfolio companies, which were partially offset by unrealized losses of $838.9 million primarily representing reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains in connection with the occurrence of realization events such as partial or full sales and management fee refunds.
for the year ended december 31, 2015, the value of our private equity investment portfolio increased 14.2%. this was comprised of a 19.5% increase in the share prices of various publicly held or publicly indexed investments and a 9.3% increase in value of our privately held investments. the most significant increases in share prices of various publicly held or publicly indexed investments were gains in walgreens boots alliance, inc., pra health sciences, inc. (nasdaq: prah) and godaddy, inc. these increases were partially offset by decreased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were rignet (nasdaq: rnet), hca holdings, inc. (nyse: hca) and citic envirotech ltd. (sp: cel). subsequent to december 31, 2015, world equity markets declined sharply with both the s&p 500 and the msci world index down on a total return basis, including dividends, as of february 22, 2016. see "--business environment". our privately held investments contributed the remainder of the change in value, the most significant of which were gains relating to panasonic healthcare co. ltd (healthcare sector), capital safety group (industrial sector) and alliant insurance services (financial services sector). the unrealized gains on our privately held investments were partially offset by unrealized losses relating primarily to bis industries ltd. (industrial sector), acteon group ltd (energy sector) and aceco ti s.a. (technology sector). the increased valuations of individual companies in our privately held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) in the case of capital safety group and alliant insurance services, valuations that reflect agreements to sell these investments in whole or in part, (ii) an increase in the value of market comparables and (iii) individual company performance. the decreased valuations of individual companies in our privately held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) individual company performance or, in certain cases, an unfavorable business outlook and (ii) a decrease in the value of market comparables.
the reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains for the year ended december 31, 2015 resulted primarily from the sale or partial sales of walgreens boots alliance, inc., capital safety group and zimmer biomet holdings, inc. during the year ended december 31, 2015, we wrote off energy future holdings (energy sector) and recognized realized losses. this write-off did not have a significant impact on our 2015 net carried interest because this investment had already been written down to zero value in prior periods. see "--segment analysis--principal activities segment" and "--liquidity--liquidity

needs--after-tax distributable earnings" for a discussion of how the energy future holdings write-off impacted principal activities and our distributable earnings. subsequent to december 31, 2015, we expect to write-off our investment in samson resources once our losses are realized. since this investment has already been written down to zero value in periods prior to december 31, 2015, this write-off is not expected to have a significant impact on our net carried interest in future periods.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, the net unrealized carried interest income of $70.1 million include $1,098.2 million representing net increases in the value of various portfolio companies, which were partially offset by unrealized losses of $1,028.1 million primarily representing reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains in connection with the occurrence of realization events such as partial or full sales and management fee refunds.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, the value of our private equity investment portfolio increased 12.8%. increased share prices of various publicly held investments comprised approximately 23% of the net increase in value for the year ended december 31, 2014, the most significant of which were gains on pra health sciences, inc., hca holdings, inc., nxp semiconductors n.v. and yageo corporation. these increases were partially offset by decreased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were tarkett s.a., prosiebensat.1 media ag and china greenland rundong auto group limited. our privately‐held investments contributed the remainder of the change in value, the most significant of which were gains relating to alliance boots gmbh, biomet, inc. and wild flavors gmbh. the unrealized gains on our privately‐held investments were partially offset by unrealized losses relating primarily to northgate information solutions, samson resources and toys r us. the increased valuations of individual companies in our privately‐held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to (i) an increase in the value of market comparables and individual company performance, (ii) in the case of wild flavors gmbh and biomet, inc., an increase that primarily reflected agreements to sell these investments, with the sale of wild flavors gmbh completed in october 2014, and (iii) in the case of alliance boots gmbh, primarily due to an agreement to exit the investment and to a lesser extent an increase in the value of a publicly traded stock that was expected to be delivered pursuant to this agreement, which was completed on december 31, 2014. the decreased valuations of individual companies in our privately‐held investments, in the aggregate, generally related to individual company performance or, in certain cases, an unfavorable business outlook.
the reversals of previously recognized net unrealized gains for the year ended december 31, 2014 resulted primarily from the sale of oriental brewery, the sale of wild flavors gmbh, the partial sale of hca holdings, inc. and the sale of jazz pharmaceuticals, inc. (nasdaq: jazz). during the year ended december 31, 2014, we wrote off a.t.u auto-teile-unger (retail sector) and u.n. ro‐ro isletmeleri a.s. (transportation sector) and recognized realized losses. these 2014 write‐offs did not have a significant impact on our 2014 net carried interest because these interests had already been substantially written down in prior periods.
segment expenses compensation and benefits the net increase was due primarily to (i) higher cash compensation and benefits consistent with a higher level of fee income in the current period and (ii) a decrease in the amount of compensation expenses allocated from private markets to principal activities as result of a decrease in the proportion of revenue earned by principal activities relative to other operating segments during 2015. these increases were partially offset by lower allocations to carry pool driven by the lower levels of net carried interest as discussed in "performance income" above.
occupancy and other operating expenses the net increase was primarily driven by (i) higher allocations of corporate operating expenses to private markets due to an increase in both the amount of corporate operating expenses incurred by the firm and an increase in the proportion of revenue earned by private markets relative to other operating segments in 2015, (ii) a decrease in the amount of operating expenses allocated from private markets to principal activities as a result of a decrease in the proportion of revenue earned by principal activities relative to other operating segments during 2015 and (iii) an increase in professional fees and other expenses. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in expenses for unconsummated transactions, also known as broken deal expenses.
economic net income (loss)
the increase was primarily due to higher fee income, partially offset by an increase in segment expenses and a decrease in performance income as described above.

as of december 31, 2014, aum has been adjusted to include capital commitments for which we are eligible to receive fees or carried interest upon deployment of capital. our reported aum for periods prior to december 31, 2014 does not include this item.
aum for the private markets segment was $66.0 billion at december 31, 2015, an increase of $1.4 billion, compared to $64.6 billion at december 31, 2014, on an as adjusted basis. the increase was primarily attributable to new capital raised primarily in european fund iv and global infrastructure investors ii and to a lesser extent an increase in value of our private markets portfolio. these increases were partially offset by distributions to private equity fund investors of $11.8 billion comprised of $6.9 billion of realized gains and $4.9 billion of return of original cost.
the increase in the value of our private markets portfolio was driven primarily by net unrealized gains of $1.8 billion, $1.5 billion and $0.9 billion in our 2006 fund, north america fund xi and asian fund ii, respectively.  this was comprised of a 19.5% increase in the share prices of various publicly held or publicly indexed investments and a 9.3% increase in value of our privately held investments. the most significant increases in share prices of various publicly held or publicly indexed investments were gains in walgreens boots alliance, inc., pra health sciences, inc. (nasdaq: prah) and godaddy, inc. these increases were partially offset by decreased share prices of various publicly held investments, the most significant of which were rignet (nasdaq: rnet), hca holdings, inc.

december 31, 2015           $45,307,400
fpaum in our private markets segment was $45.3 billion at december 31, 2015, a decrease of $2.0 billion, compared to $47.3 billion at december 31, 2014. the decrease was primarily attributable to distributions to private equity fund investors and a reduction in fpaum attributable to the invested capital of samson resources due to its bankruptcy proceedings which is included within distributions and other in the table above. these decreases were partially offset by new capital raised of $3.9 billion primarily in our european fund iv and global infrastructure investors ii funds.
132
capital invested the decrease was due to a decrease in the amount of capital invested in our private equity platform, which was partially offset by an increase in capital invested in our real assets platforms (real estate, energy and infrastructure). for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, capital invested in our private equity platform was $4.6 billion and $7.8 billion, respectively, and capital invested in our real assets platforms was $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. generally, the operating companies acquired through our private equity business have higher transaction values and result in higher capital invested relative to transactions in our real assets businesses. the number of large private equity investments made in any quarter is volatile and consequently, a significant amount of capital invested in one quarter or a few quarters may not be indicative of a similar level of capital deployment in future quarters.
uncalled commitments as of december 31, 2015, our private markets segment had $22.8 billion of remaining uncalled capital commitments that could be called for investments in new transactions.

segment revenues management, monitoring and transaction fees, net the net increase was primarily due to an increase in management fees of $65.0 million which included $40.2 million of increased management fees earned relating to our strategic investment in marshall wace lp and its affiliates ("marshall wace") which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2015 and higher management fees relating to an increase in capital invested in our special situations fund ii, lending partners ii fund, and lending partners europe fund, as well as new capital raised primarily in corporate capital trust (a private bdc sub-advised by kkr). this increase was partially offset by a decrease in management fees in our hedge funds solutions business as a result of a reduction in fee paying aum due to redemptions as well as our mezzanine fund entering its post-investment period, when it earns fees at a lower rate and on invested rather than committed capital.
performance income the net increase was primarily attributable to higher incentive fees and a lower level of net carried interest losses compared to the prior period. incentive fees increased due primarily to higher incentive fees relating to our strategic partnership with marshall wace which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2015 and higher incentive fees at corporate capital trust reflecting favorable investment performance. these incentive fee increases were partially offset by a lower level of incentive fees in our hedge funds solutions business driven by less favorable financial performance in 2016. incentive fees are typically determined for the twelve-month periods ending in either the second or fourth quarters of the calendar year, however, such fees may be determined quarterly or at other points during the year for certain strategies. whether incentive fees from kkr vehicles or strategic partnerships are payable in any given period, and the amount of such incentive fee payments, if any, depends on the investment performance of the vehicle and as a result is expected to vary significantly from period to period. the lower level of net carried interest losses was primarily the result of (i) carried interest losses in the prior year in our special situations fund compared to no carried interest in the current year and (ii) increased carried interest in our lending partners ii fund, partially offset by (iii) carried interest losses in our mezzanine fund and lending partners fund in 2016.
segment expenses compensation and benefits the increase was primarily due to higher net performance income compensation in connection with a higher level of realized incentive fees for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared the year ended december 31, 2015 as described above. to a lesser extent there was an increase in cash compensation and benefits primarily due to a higher level of management fees which generally results in higher compensation expense.
occupancy and other operating expenses the decrease was primarily driven by a reduction reflecting the cost to exit office space during 2015.

the increase is primarily attributable to the increase in management fees and performance income partially offset by an increase in compensation and benefits expense as described above.

aum in our public markets segment totaled $55.7 billion at december 31, 2016, an increase of $2.2 billion compared to aum of $53.5 billion at december 31, 2015. the increase for the period was primarily due to new capital raised of $12.6 billion across multiple strategies most notably $3.1 billion in our clos, $2.5 billion in our strategic partnerships in hedge fund managers, $2.1 billion in our liquid credit strategies and $1.7 billion in our hedge fund solutions business. partially offsetting these increases were redemptions and distributions of $11.0 billion from certain investment vehicles across multiple strategies including our clos, our hedge fund solutions business, certain separately managed accounts and our strategic partnerships. for the year ended december 31, 2016, within our hedge funds business, new capital raised has outpaced redemptions within our strategic partnership platform, while redemptions have outpaced new capital raised in our hedge fund solutions platform.

fpaum in our public markets segment was $49.3 billion at december 31, 2016, an increase of $2.9 billion compared to fpaum of $46.4 billion at december 31, 2015. the increase was primarily due to new capital raised of $13.7 billion across multiple strategies most notably $3.1 billion in our clos, $2.5 billion in our strategic partnerships in hedge fund managers, $2.0 billion in our liquid credit strategies and $1.7 billion in our hedge fund solutions business. new capital raised includes capital that was raised in previous periods but began earning fees upon deployment of capital. partially offsetting these increases were redemptions and distributions of $11.1 billion from certain investment vehicles across multiple strategies including our clos, hedge fund solutions business, certain separately managed accounts and our strategic partnerships. for the year ended december 31, 2016, within our hedge fund business, new capital raised has outpaced redemptions with our strategic partnerships with hedge fund managers, while redemptions have outpaced new capital raised in our hedge fund solutions platform. uncalled capital commitments from investment funds from which kkr is currently not earning management fees amounted to approximately $4.2 billion.  this capital will generally begin to earn management fees upon deployment of the capital or upon the commencement of the fund's investment period.  the average annual management fee rate associated with this capital is approximately 1.2%.  we will not begin earnings fees on this capital until it is deployed or the related investment period commences, neither of which is guaranteed.  if and when such management fees are earned, which will occur over an extended period of time, a portion of existing fpaum may cease paying fees or pay lower fees, thus offsetting a portion of any new management fees earned.
capital invested capital invested decreased in the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. the decrease is primarily due to a lower level of net capital deployed in our special situations strategy partially offset by a higher level of net capital deployed in our mezzanine or private credit opportunities strategy.
uncalled commitments as of december 31, 2016, our public markets segment had $6.3 billion of uncalled capital commitments that could be called for investments in new transactions. the decrease from december 31, 2015 is due to capital called from limited partners to fund investments during the period, partially offset by new capital raised primarily in special situations fund ii, private credit opportunities partners ii fund and a co-invest vehicle investing across multiple strategies.

segment revenues management, monitoring and transaction fees, net the net decrease was primarily due to a decrease in management fees of $6.4 million. the decrease in management fees was due primarily to (i) a decrease in management fees received from kfn as a result of our acquisition of it on april 30, 2014, as management fees from kfn after that date were eliminated from segment results, (ii) redemptions in our hedge funds business and (iii) our mezzanine fund entering its post-investment period where it earns fees at a lower rate and on invested rather than committed capital. these decreases were partially offset by management fees earned from new capital raised primarily in corporate capital trust as well as management fees earned relating to our investment in marshall wace which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2015.
performance income the net decrease was primarily attributable to net carried interest losses in 2015 and a lower level of incentive fees. the net carried interest losses were primarily due to losses in our special situations strategy accounts and funds as well as lower overall appreciation in our mezzanine and direct lending strategies during 2015. the decrease in incentive fees is due primarily to a decrease in incentive fees received from kfn as a result of our acquisition of it on april 30, 2014, as incentive fees from kfn after that date were eliminated from segment results, as well as lower incentive fees in our hedge fund-of-funds platform and european credit platform driven primarily by less favorable financial performance in the current year. incentive fees are typically determined for the twelve-month periods ending in either the second or fourth quarters of the calendar year, however, such fees may also be determined quarterly or at other points during the year. whether an incentive fee from kkr vehicles is payable in any given period, and the amount of an incentive fee payment, if any, depends on the investment performance of the vehicle and as a result are expected to vary significantly from period to period.
segment expenses compensation and benefits the decrease was primarily due to (i) reversals of unrealized performance income compensation in connection with net carried interest losses in 2015 in certain carry earning funds, (ii) lower appreciation in certain carry earning funds in 2015 and (iii) a decrease in realized performance income compensation reflecting the decrease in incentive fees, each of which are described above.
occupancy and other operating expenses the increase was primarily driven by (i) higher occupancy costs reflecting the cost of an exit of office space during the year, (ii) higher allocations of corporate other operating expenses to public markets due to an increase in both the amount of corporate other operating expenses incurred by the firm and an increase in the proportion of revenue earned by public markets relative to other operating segments in 2015 and (iii) a decrease in the amount of operating expenses allocated from public markets to principal activities as result of a decrease in the proportion of revenue earned by principal activities relative to other operating segments during 2015.
economic net income (loss)
the decrease is primarily attributable to the decrease in performance income and fees partially offset by lower expenses as described above.

fpaum in our public markets segment was $46.4 billion at december 31, 2015, an increase of $7.8 billion compared to fpaum of $38.6 billion at december 31, 2014, on an as adjusted basis. the increase was primarily due to new capital raised of $9.2 billion across multiple strategies primarily in our clos, special situations strategy, hedge funds business and corporate capital trust. in addition, in the fourth quarter of 2015, kkr acquired 24.9% of marshall wace, resulting in the inclusion of kkr's pro-rata portion of the fpaum managed by marshall wace. partially offsetting these increases were (i) decreases of $6.3 billion relating to redemptions and distributions from certain investment vehicles across multiple strategies primarily in clos, our hedge funds platform and strategic partnerships, (ii) decreases in value primarily in our european credit and hedge fund platforms related to foreign currency fluctuations and (iii) a net change in fee base of $0.3 billion reflecting our mezzanine fund entering its post-investment period.
capital invested the increase is primarily due to a higher level of investment activity in our direct lending, special situations and mezzanine strategies.

segment revenues management, monitoring and transaction fees, net transaction fees decreased due primarily to smaller transaction sizes for the year ended december 31, 2016 compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. overall, we completed 117 capital markets transactions for the year ended december 31, 2016 of which 11 represented equity offerings and 106 represented debt offerings, as compared to 116 transactions for the year ended december 31, 2015 of which 16 represented equity offerings and 100 represented debt offerings. we earned fees in connection with underwriting, syndication and other capital markets services. while each of the capital markets transactions that we undertake in this segment is separately negotiated, our fee rates are generally higher with respect to underwriting or syndicating equity offerings than with respect to debt offerings, and the amount of fees that we collect for like transactions generally correlates with overall transaction sizes. our capital markets fees are sourced from our private markets and public markets businesses as well as third party companies. for the year ended december 31, 2016 approximately 28% of our transaction fees were earned from third parties as compared to approximately 24% for the year ended december 31, 2015. our transaction fees are comprised of fees earned from north america, europe, and asia-pacific, including india. for the year ended december 31, 2016 approximately 34% of our transaction fees were sourced internationally as compared to approximately 44% for the year ended december 31, 2015. our capital markets business is dependent on the overall capital markets environment, which is influenced by equity prices, credit spreads and volatility. our capital markets business does not generate management or monitoring fees.
segment expenses compensation and benefits the decrease compared to the prior period is primarily related to the reduction in transaction fees noted above.
occupancy and other operating expenses the overall increase was primarily due to a lower amount of expenses allocated from the capital markets segment to the principal activities segment as a result of a decrease in the proportion of revenue earned by principal activities relative to other operating segments as compared to the prior period. this increase was offset by a reduction in the amount of rent expense allocated to the capital markets segment.
economic net income (loss)
the increase is primarily attributable to lower income attributable to noncontrolling interests and the reduction in compensation and benefits expense, which was partially offset by a decrease in transaction fees as described above.
syndicated capital the increase is primarily due to an increase in the size of syndication transactions in the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2015. overall, we completed 8 syndication transactions for the year ended december 31, 2016 as compared to 10 syndications for the year ended december 31, 2015.

segment revenues management, monitoring and transaction fees, net transaction fees decreased due to a decrease in the number and size of capital markets transactions for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. our capital markets business does not generate management or monitoring fees. overall, we completed 116 capital markets transactions for the year ended december 31, 2015 of which 16 represented equity offerings and 100 represented debt offerings, as compared to 139 transactions for the year ended december 31, 2014 of which 15 represented equity offerings and 124 represented debt offerings. we earned fees in connection
143
with underwriting, syndication and other capital markets services. while each of the capital markets transactions that we undertake in this segment is separately negotiated, our fee rates are generally higher with respect to underwriting or syndicating equity offerings than with respect to debt offerings, and the amount of fees that we collect for like transactions generally correlates with overall transaction sizes. our capital markets fees are sourced from our private markets and public markets platforms as well as third party companies. for the year ended december 31, 2015 approximately 24% of our transaction fees were earned from third parties as compared to 31% for the year ended december 31, 2014. our transaction fees are comprised of fees earned from north america, europe, and asia-pacific, including india. for the year ended december 31, 2015 approximately 44% of our transaction fees were sourced outside the united states as compared to approximately 38% for the year ended december 31, 2014. our capital markets business is dependent on the overall capital markets environment, which is influenced by, among other things, equity prices, credit spreads and volatility.
segment expenses compensation and benefits the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in cash compensation and benefits related to lower transaction fees, which generally results in lower compensation expense.
occupancy and other operating expenses the increase was primarily driven by higher allocations of corporate other operating expenses to capital markets due to an increase in both the amount of corporate other operating expenses incurred by the firm and to a lesser extent an increase in the proportion of revenue earned by capital markets relative to other operating segments in 2015. additionally, there was a decrease in the amount of operating expenses allocated from capital markets to principal activities as result of a decrease in the proportion of revenue earned by principal activities relative to other operating segments during 2015.
economic net income (loss)
the decrease is primarily attributable to the decrease in transaction fees as described above.
syndicated capital the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in the size of syndication transactions in the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31, 2014. the 2014 amounts included the syndication of equity in first data corporation of approximately $1.8 billion. overall, we completed 10 syndication transactions for the year ended december 31, 2015 as compared to 8 syndication transactions for the year ended december 31, 2014.

segment revenues investment income the net decrease is primarily due to a higher level of realized and unrealized losses during the year ended december 31, 2016, compared to the prior period and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in net interest and dividends of $74.4 million.
for the year ended december 31, 2016, net realized gains were primarily comprised of gains from the sale of private equity investments including the sales or partial sales of walgreens boots alliance, inc., hca holdings, inc. and zimmer biomet holdings, inc., offset by our investment in samson resources of approximately $254 million, the loss from the redemption of limited partner interests in a fund managed by blackgold capital management, as well as certain clos being called. as of december 31, 2016, kkr no longer holds any limited partner interests in blackgold capital management, although we continue to own an interest in its management company and fund general partner. net unrealized losses were primarily attributable to mark to market losses on various private markets investments including first data corporation and to a lesser extent wmih corp. (nasdaq: wmih), walgreens boots alliance, inc., mark to market losses on various alternative credit investments and unrealized losses on energy investments, and reversals of unrealized gains on the sales of private equity investments. these unrealized losses were partially offset by unrealized gains representing the reversal of unrealized losses primarily in connection with our investment in samson resources and the limited partner interests in a fund managed by blackgold capital management as described above.
as of december 31, 2016, $227.4 million of investments in clos and our $289.7 million investment in kkr real estate finance trust inc., our real estate investment trust or reit, were carried at cost. as of december 31, 2016, the cumulative net unrealized gain or loss relating to changes in fair value for these investments was a $9.1 million gain for clos and a $13.0 million gain for the real estate investment trust.
since april 30, 2014, the date we completed our acquisition of kfn, the amount of invested capital in our clos has decreased. as of december 31, 2016, the notes issued by all six legacy clos held by kfn have been called for redemption. these legacy clos held by kfn, which were issued prior to 2012, were larger in total transaction size relative to those that were issued subsequently. the size of new clos and the frequency of clo issuances will depend on market conditions. clo issuances typically increase when the spread between the value of clo assets and liabilities generates an attractive return to kkr and other subordinated note holders, such as kkr. in the case where demand for loans leads to tighter spreads or if interest rates for the liabilities increase, the return to subordinated note holders would be less attractive, and the issuance of clos would be expected to generally decline. consequently, since april 30, 2014, the amount of interest income and dividends from our clos has declined.  while the size of our clo portfolio may continue to decline in the near term, along with the levels of associated interest income and dividends, as we have called for redemption all notes issued by all six legacy clos held by kfn, we do not expect the rate of decline in the near term to be as significant as in recent quarters. based on the above factors combined with alternative investment opportunities, we may selectively redeploy capital to other assets outside of clos and credit into other asset classes such as private equity.
for the year ended december 31, 2015, net realized gains were comprised primarily of gains from the sale of private equity investments, generally held through or alongside our funds, including the sales or partial sales of walgreens boots alliance, inc., the nielsen company b.v. (nyse: nlsn), zimmer biomet holdings, inc. and kion gmbh (xetra: kgx). these realized gains were partially offset by realized losses on the sale or write-off of other private equity investments, generally held through or alongside our funds, including the write-off of energy future holdings. realized investment losses from balance sheet investments that were already written down as of october 1, 2009 that have been excluded from net realized gains (losses) above related to energy future holdings and amounted to approximately $100 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. net unrealized losses were primarily attributable to (i) the reversal of gains on sales of private equity investments noted in the realized gains commentary above and (ii) overall reductions in value of our investments in clos, energy investments in working interests in oil and gas producing properties and special situations investments. a decrease in the value of our clo portfolio was experienced in each quarter of 2015 and was due primarily to a decrease in the market value of underlying collateral as well as a reduction in overall market prices for these securities. with respect to our energy portfolio, a decrease in value was experienced in three of four quarters during 2015 and is due primarily to a drop in long‐term oil, condensate, natural gas liquids, and natural gas prices during the year ended december 31, 2015. offsetting these unrealized losses were unrealized gains resulting from increases in value of various investments, most notably first data corporation, walgreens boots alliance, inc. and wmih corp., as well as the reversal of unrealized losses related to the write-off of energy future holdings, corp.
for the year ended december 31, 2016, net interest and dividends were comprised of (i) $186.7 million of interest income which consists primarily of interest that is received from our public markets investments including clos and other credit investments and to a lesser extent our cash balances and other assets, (ii) $136.2 million of dividend income from distributions
146
received primarily through our private equity investments, real estate investments including our investment in our reit and public markets investments and (iii) $188.8 million of interest expense primarily relating to the senior notes outstanding for kkr and kfn.
for the year ended december 31, 2015, net interest and dividends were comprised of (i) $316.5 million of interest income which consists primarily of interest that is received from interest yielding clos and credit investments and, to a lesser extent, from our cash balances and other assets, (ii) $95.0 million of dividend income received primarily from distributions received through our investment funds and other assets and (iii) $203.1 million of interest expense primarily relating to the senior notes outstanding for kkr and kfn.
the net decrease in net interest and dividends is due primarily to the lower amount of capital invested in clos described above, partially offset by a higher level of dividends in the 2016 period.
segment expenses compensation and benefits the decrease was primarily due to a lower amount of compensation and benefits expenses allocated from the other operating segments to principal activities, as well as a lower amount of corporate compensation allocated to principal activities, in each case as a result of a decrease in the proportion of revenue earned by principal activities relative to other operating segments. this decrease was partially offset by an increase in the absolute amount of expenses eligible to be allocated from the other operating segments to principal activities. see "-segment analysis" for a discussion of expense allocations among segments.
occupancy and other operating expenses the decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in the amount of occupancy and other operating expenses allocated from the other operating segments primarily as a result of a decrease in the proportion of revenue earned by principal activities relative to other operating segments.
economic net income (loss)
the economic net loss for the year ended december 31, 2016 was primarily driven by the net investment losses as described above. most notably for the year ended december 31, 2016, the reduction in the stock price of first data corporation from $16.02 per share to $14.19 per share that is held directly in the principal activities segment reduced eni by approximately $142 million.

(nyse: nlsn), zimmer biomet holdings, inc. and kion gmbh (xetra: kgx). these realized gains were partially offset by realized losses on the sale or write-off of other private equity investments, generally held through or alongside our funds, including the write-off of energy future holdings. realized investment losses from balance sheet investments that were already written down as of october 1, 2009 that have been excluded from net realized gains (losses) above related to energy future holdings and amounted to approximately $100 million for the year ended december 31, 2015. net unrealized losses were primarily attributable to (i) the reversal of gains on sales of private equity investments noted in the realized gains commentary above and (ii) overall reductions in value of our investments in clos, energy investments in working interests in oil and gas producing properties and special situations investments. a decrease in the value of our clo portfolio was experienced in each quarter of 2015 and was due primarily to a decrease in the market value of underlying collateral as well as a reduction in overall market prices for these securities. with respect to our energy portfolio, a decrease in value was experienced in three of four quarters during 2015 and was due primarily to a drop in long‐term oil, condensate, natural gas liquids, and natural gas prices during the year ended december 31, 2015. offsetting these unrealized losses were unrealized gains resulting from increases in value of various investments, most notably first data corporation, walgreens boots alliance, inc. and wmi holdings corp. (nasdaq: wmih), as well as the reversal of unrealized losses related to the write-off of energy future holdings, corp.
as of december 31, 2015, we held $96.6 million of investments in clos that are not held for investment purposes and are carried at cost. for the year ended december 31, 2015, the unrealized loss relating to changes in fair value for these investments in clos was $7.6 million. prior to the quarter ended september 30, 2015, all clos were carried at fair value.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, net realized gains were comprised primarily of gains from the sale of private equity investments, generally held through or alongside our funds, including the sales or partial sales of hca holdings, inc., nxp semiconductors n.v. and the nielsen company b.v. net unrealized losses are primarily related to (i) the reversal of gains on sales of private equity investments noted in the realized gains commentary above, (ii) declines in value of various investments in working interests in oil and gas producing properties, (iii) a decline in value for samson resources, (iv) overall reductions in value of our investments in clos, driven primarily by a decrease in the market value of underlying collateral and (v) a decline in value of investments in specialty finance companies. for the year ended december 31, 2014, mark-to-market unrealized losses reflected in net unrealized losses relating to our energy investments in working interests in oil and gas producing properties were approximately $149 million, the majority of which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2014 primarily as a result of a decline in oil and gas prices. these unrealized losses and reversals of gains upon realization events were partially offset by unrealized gains resulting from increases in value of various private equity investments including first data corporation, alliance boots gmbh and biomet, inc.
for the year ended december 31, 2015, interest income and dividends were comprised of (i) $316.5 million of interest income which consists primarily of interest that is received from interest yielding clos and credit investments and, to a lesser extent, from our cash balances and other assets and (ii) $95.0 million of dividend income received primarily from distributions received through our investment funds and other assets. for the year ended december 31, 2014, interest income and dividends were comprised of (i) $241.7 million of interest income which consists primarily of interest that is received from interest yielding clos and credit investments and, to a lesser extent, from our cash balances and other assets and (ii) $166.4 million of dividend income received primarily from distributions received through our investment funds and other assets, including approximately $84 million received from our energy investments in working interests in oil and gas producing properties. the increase from the prior period is primarily due to more significant levels of investments in interest yielding clos and credit investments, which were largely offset by a decrease in dividend income from our private equity and energy investments portfolio.
the increase in interest expense is primarily due to our 2044 senior notes issued on may 29, 2014 and an additional issuance of such notes on march 18, 2015, as well as the debt obligations of kfn acquired on april 30, 2014 which did not contribute to our interest expense for the first four months of 2014.

segment expenses compensation and benefits the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the amount of compensation and benefits expenses allocated from the other operating segments to principal activities, as well as a lower amount of corporate compensation allocated to principal activities, in each case as a result of a decrease in the proportion of revenue earned by principal activities relative to other operating segments during 2015. partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in the aggregate compensation and benefits expense in our other operating segments that are allocable to the principal activities segment. see "-segment analysis-private markets", "-segment analysis-public markets" and "-segment analysis-capital markets" for additional information regarding the compensation and benefit expenses of these other segments, and "-segment analysis" for a discussion of expense allocations among segments.
occupancy and other operating expenses the decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in the amount of occupancy and other operating expenses allocated from the other operating segments as a result of a decrease in the proportion of revenue earned by principal activities relative to other operating segments during 2015.
economic net income (loss)
the decrease is primarily attributable to the decrease in investment income as described above.
segment balance sheet our segment balance sheet is the balance sheet of kkr & co. l.p. and its subsidiaries on a segment basis which includes, but is not limited to, our investment management companies, broker-dealer companies, general partners of our investment funds and kfn. our segment balance sheet excludes the assets and liabilities of our investment funds and cfes and other consolidated entities that are not subsidiaries of kkr & co. l.p.
investments investments is a term used solely for purposes of financial presentation of a portion of kkr's balance sheet and includes majority ownership of subsidiaries that operate kkr's asset management and other businesses, including the general partner interests of kkr's investment funds.
cash and short-term investments cash and short-term investments represent cash and liquid short-term investments in high-grade, short-duration cash management strategies used by kkr to generate additional yield on our excess liquidity and is used by management in evaluating kkr's liquidity position. we believe this measure is useful to unitholders as it provides additional insight into kkr's available liquidity. cash and short-term investments differ from cash and cash equivalents on a gaap basis as a result of the inclusion of liquid short-term investments in cash and short-term investments. the impact that these liquid short-term investments have on cash and cash equivalents on a gaap basis is reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows within cash flows from operating activities. accordingly, the exclusion of these investments from cash and cash equivalents on a gaap basis has no impact on cash provided (used) by operating activities, investing activities or financing activities.

(1) represents equity awards granted under the equity incentive plan. the issuance of common units of kkr & co. l.p. pursuant to awards under the equity incentive plan dilutes kkr common unitholders and kkr holdings pro rata in accordance with their respective percentage interests in the kkr business. year-end 2016 equity awards were granted before december 31, 2016 (except for awards to our named executive officers), rather than, as has been historical practice, after the end of the year. as a result, adjusted units increased in the fourth quarter of 2016, rather than in the first quarter of 2017.
(2) represents securities in a subsidiary of a kkr group partnership and of kkr & co. l.p. that are exchangeable into kkr & co. l.p. common units issued in connection with the acquisition of avoca.
(3) common units that may be issued by kkr & co. l.p. upon exchange of units in kkr holdings l.p. for kkr common units.
liquidity we manage our liquidity and capital requirements by focusing on our cash flows before the consolidation of our funds and cfes and the effect of changes in short term assets and liabilities, which we anticipate will be settled for cash within one year. our primary cash flow activities on a segment basis typically involve: (i) generating cash flow from operations; (ii) generating income from investment activities, by investing in investments that generate yield (namely interest and dividends) as well as the sale of investments and other assets; (iii) funding capital commitments that we have made to, and advancing capital to, our funds and clos; (iv) developing and funding new investment strategies, investment products and other growth initiatives, including acquisitions; (v) underwriting and funding commitments in our capital markets business; (vi) distributing cash flow to our unitholders, certain holders of certain exchangeable securities and holders of our series a and series b preferred units; and (vii) paying borrowings, interest payments and repayments under credit agreements, our senior notes and other borrowing arrangements. see "-liquidity - liquidity needs - distributions."
sources of liquidity our primary sources of liquidity consist of amounts received from: (i) our operating activities, including the fees earned from our funds, portfolio companies, and capital markets transactions; (ii) realizations on carried interest from our investment funds; (iii) interest and dividends from investments that generate yield, including our investments in clos; (iv) realizations on and sales of investments and other assets, including the transfers of investments for fund formations and (v) borrowings under our credit facilities, debt offerings and other borrowing arrangements. in addition, we may generate cash proceeds from sales of equity securities.
with respect to our private equity funds, carried interest is distributed to the general partner of a private equity fund with a clawback provision only after all of the following are met: (i) a realization event has occurred (e.g., sale of a portfolio company,
155
dividend, etc.); (ii) the vehicle has achieved positive overall investment returns since its inception, in excess of performance hurdles where applicable; and (iii) with respect to investments with a fair value below cost, cost has been returned to fund investors in an amount sufficient to reduce remaining cost to the investments' fair value. as of december 31, 2016, certain of our funds had met the first and second criteria, as described above, but did not meet the third criteria. in these cases, carried interest accrues on the consolidated statement of operations, but will not be distributed in cash to us as the general partner of an investment fund upon a realization event. for a fund that has a fair value above cost, overall, but has one or more investments where fair value is below cost, the shortfall between cost and fair value for such investments is referred to as a "netting hole." when netting holes are present, realized gains on individual investments that would otherwise allow the general partner to receive carried interest distributions are instead used to return invested capital to our funds' limited partners in an amount equal to the netting hole. once netting holes have been filled with either (a) return of capital equal to the netting hole for those investments where fair value is below cost, or (b) increases in the fair value of those investments where fair value is below cost, then realized carried interest will be distributed to the general partner upon a realization event. a fund that is in a position to pay cash carry refers to a fund for which carried interest is expected to be paid to the general partner upon the next material realization event, which includes funds with no netting holes as well as funds with a netting hole that is sufficiently small in size such that the next material realization event would be expected to result in the payment of carried interest.
as of december 31, 2016, a netting hole in excess of $50 million existed at our european fund iv for $100.9 million. in accordance with the criteria set forth above, other funds currently have and may in the future develop netting holes, and netting holes for those and other funds may otherwise increase or decrease in the future.
we have access to funding under various credit facilities, other borrowing arrangements and other sources of liquidity that we have entered into with major financial institutions or which we receive from the capital markets. the following describes these sources of liquidity.
revolving credit agreements, senior notes, kfn debt obligations & kfn securities for a discussion of kkr's debt obligations, including our revolving credit agreements, senior notes, kfn debt obligations and kfn securities, see note 10 "debt obligations" to the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this report. the information presented below supplements and updates, and should be read in conjunction with, such information. no amounts were borrowed under our corporate credit agreement for the year ended december 31, 2016.
kcm credit agreement kkr capital markets maintains a revolving credit agreement with a major financial institution, or the kcm credit agreement, for use in kkr's capital markets business. this financial institution also holds an ownership interest in our capital markets business. the kcm credit agreement provides for revolving borrowings of up to $500 million with a $500 million sublimit for letters of credit.
on march 30, 2016, the kcm credit agreement was amended to extend the maturity date from march 30, 2017 to march 30, 2021. if a borrowing is made on the kcm credit agreement, the interest rate will vary depending on the type of borrowing requested. if the borrowing is a eurocurrency loan, it will be based on the libor plus the applicable margin which ranges initially between 1.25% and 2.50%, depending on the amount and tenor of the borrowing. if the borrowing is an abr loan, it will be based on the prime rate plus the applicable margin which ranges initially between 0.25% and 1.50% depending on the amount and tenor of the borrowing. borrowings under this facility may only be used for kkr's capital markets business, and its only obligors are entities involved in our capital markets business, and its liabilities are non-recourse to other parts of kkr.
for the year ended december 31, 2016, a total of $848 million was borrowed and $848 million was repaid under the kcm credit agreement. for the year ended december 31, 2015, a total of $97 million was borrowed and $124 million was repaid under the kcm credit agreement. amounts borrowed under the kcm credit agreement are generally repaid within 3 months.
kfn issued 8.375% notes due 2041
on november 15, 2011, kfn issued $258.8 million par amount of 8.375% senior notes, or kfn 2041 senior notes, resulting in net proceeds to kfn of $250.7 million. the notes traded under the ticker symbol "kfh" on the nyse. interest on the 8.375% senior notes was payable quarterly in arrears on february 15, may 15, august 15 and november 15 of each year. the kfn 2041 senior notes would have matured on november 15, 2041 if not redeemed or repurchased in accordance with their terms prior to such date.
156
on november 15, 2016, kfn redeemed all of the outstanding 8.375% senior notes due 2041 for cash. the redemption price equaled 100% of the principal amount of the kfn 2041 senior notes plus unpaid interest accrued thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date, in accordance with the terms of the kfn 2041 senior notes.
preferred units on march 17, 2016, kkr & co. l.p. issued 13,800,000 units of 6.75% series a preferred units and on june 20, 2016, kkr issued 6,200,000 units of 6.50% series b preferred units, in each case, in an underwritten public offering. the series a preferred units and series b preferred units trade on the nyse under the symbols "kkr pra" and "kkr prb", respectively. the terms of the preferred units are set forth in the limited partnership agreement of kkr & co. l.p.
if declared, distributions on the preferred units are payable quarterly on march 15, june 15, september 15 and december 15 of each year, at a rate per annum equal to 6.75%, in the case of the series a preferred units, and 6.50% in the case of the series b preferred units. distributions on the preferred units are discretionary and non-cumulative. holders of preferred units will only receive distributions on such units when, as and if declared by the board of directors of the general partner of kkr & co. l.p. we have no obligation to declare or pay any distribution for any distribution period, whether or not distributions on any series of preferred units are declared or paid for any other distribution period.
unless distributions have been declared and paid (or declared and set apart for payment) on the preferred units for a quarterly distribution period, we may not declare or pay distributions on, or repurchase, any units of kkr & co. l.p. that are junior to the preferred units, including our common units, during such distribution period. a distribution period begins on a distribution payment date and extends to, but excludes, the next distribution payment date. see "--liquidity needs--distributions" for a discussion of the distributions declared on the series a and series b preferred units.
if kkr & co. l.p. dissolves, then the holders of the series a preferred units and series b preferred units are entitled to receive payment of a $25.00 liquidation preference per preferred unit, plus declared and unpaid distributions, if any, to the extent that we have sufficient gross income (excluding any gross income attributable to the sale or exchange of capital assets) such that holders of such preferred units have capital account balances equal to such liquidation preference, plus declared and unpaid distributions, if any.
the series a and series b preferred units do not have a maturity date. however, the series a preferred units may be redeemed at our option, in whole or in part, at any time on or after june 15, 2021, at a price of $25.00 per series a preferred unit, plus declared and unpaid distributions, if any.  the series b preferred units may be redeemed at our option, in whole or in part, at any time on or after september 15, 2021, at a price of $25.00 per series b preferred unit, plus declared and unpaid distributions, if any.  holders of preferred units have no right to require the redemption of such units.
if a certain change of control event with a ratings downgrade occurs prior to june 15, 2021, the series a preferred units may be redeemed at our option, in whole but not in part, upon at least 30 days' notice, within 60 days of the occurrence of such change of control event, at a price of $25.25 per series a preferred unit, plus declared and unpaid distributions, if any.  if a certain change of control event with a ratings downgrade occurs prior to september 15, 2021, the series b preferred units may be redeemed at our option, in whole but not in part, upon at least 30 days' notice, within 60 days of the occurrence of such change of control event, at a price of $25.25 per series b preferred unit, plus declared and unpaid distributions, if any.  if such a change of control event occurs (whether before, on or after june 15, 2021, in the case of the series a preferred units and september 15, 2021, in the case of the series b preferred units) and we do not give such notice, the distribution rate per annum on the applicable series of preferred units will increase by 5.00%, beginning on the 31st day following such change of control event.
the series a and series b preferred units are not convertible into common units of kkr & co. l.p. and have no voting rights, except that holders of preferred units have certain voting rights in limited circumstances relating to the election of directors following the failure to declare and pay distributions, certain amendments to the terms of the preferred units, and the creation of preferred units that are senior to the series a preferred units and series b preferred units.
in connection with the issuance of the preferred units, the kkr group partnerships issued for the benefit of kkr & co. l.p. two series of preferred units with economic terms that mirror those of each series of preferred units.
common units on may 16, 2014, kkr & co. l.p. filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for the sale by us from time to time of up to 5,000,000 common units of kkr & co. l.p. to generate cash proceeds (a) up to (1) the
157
amount of withholding taxes, social benefit payments or similar payments payable by us in respect of awards granted pursuant to the equity incentive plan, and (2) the amount of cash delivered in respect of awards granted pursuant to the equity incentive plan that are settled in cash instead of common units; and (b) to the extent the net proceeds from the sale of common units exceeds the amounts due under clause (a), for general corporate purposes. the administrator of the equity incentive plan is expected to reduce the maximum number of common units eligible to be issued under the equity incentive plan by the number of common units issued and sold pursuant to this registration statement, as applicable, unless such reduction is already provided for with respect to such awards under the terms of the equity incentive plan. the securities and exchange commission declared the registration statement effective on june 4, 2014. as of december 31, 2016, 4,173,039 common units have been issued and sold under the registration statement and are included in our basic common units outstanding as of december 31, 2016. during 2016, we canceled 3.6 million granted equity awards for approximately $53 million to satisfy tax obligations in connection with their vesting.
liquidity needs we expect that our primary liquidity needs will consist of cash required to:
•   continue to grow our business, including seeding new strategies and funding our capital commitments made to existing and future funds, co-investments and any net capital requirements of our capital markets companies;
•   warehouse investments in portfolio companies or other investments for the benefit of one or more of our funds, vehicles, accounts or clos pending the contribution of committed capital by the investors in such vehicles, and advancing capital to them for operational or other needs;
•   service debt obligations including the payment of obligations upon maturity or redemption, as well as any contingent liabilities that may give rise to future cash payments;
•   fund cash operating expenses, including litigation matters;
•   pay amounts that may become due under our tax receivable agreement with kkr holdings;
•   make cash distributions in accordance with our distribution policy for our common units or the terms of our preferred units;
•   underwrite commitments within our capital markets business;
•   make future purchase price payments in connection with our proprietary investments, such as our strategic partnership with marshall wace;
•   acquire additional assets for our principal activities segment, including other businesses and corporate real estate; and
•   repurchase kkr &amp; co. l.p. common units pursuant to the unit repurchase program announced on october 27, 2015 and amended on february 9, 2017.
kkr & co. l.p. unit repurchase program on october 27, 2015, kkr announced the authorization of a program providing for the repurchase by kkr of up to $500 million in the aggregate of its outstanding common units. under this unit repurchase program, units may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. the timing, manner, price and amount of any unit repurchases will be determined by kkr in its discretion and will depend on a variety of factors, including legal requirements, price and economic and market conditions. kkr expects that the program, which has no expiration date, will be in effect until the maximum approved dollar amount has been used to repurchase common units. the program does not require kkr to repurchase any specific number of common units, and the program may be suspended, extended, modified or discontinued at any time. since inception of the unit repurchase program through february 9, 2017, kkr has repurchased and canceled approximately 31.7 million outstanding common units for approximately $459 million. in addition, on february 9, 2017, kkr announced an incremental $250 million has been authorized to repurchase common units. this amount is in addition to the $41 million remaining as of february 9, 2017 under the current repurchase program. for additional information regarding units repurchased during the fourth quarter of 2016, see "--item 5. market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities."
158
capital commitments the agreements governing our active investment funds generally require the general partners of the funds to make minimum capital commitments to such funds, which usually range from 2% to 8% of a fund's total capital commitments at final closing; however, the size of our general partner commitment to certain funds pursuing newer strategies may exceed this range. the following table presents our uncalled commitments to our active investment funds as of december 31, 2016:

as of december 31, 2016, kkr had unfunded commitments consisting of (i) $2,584.9 million, as shown above, to its active investment funds, (ii) $610.2 million in connection with commitments by kkr's capital markets business and (iii) other investment commitments of $70.5 million. whether these amounts are actually funded, in whole or in part depends on the terms of such commitments, including the satisfaction or waiver of any conditions to funding.
prisma capital partners on october 1, 2012, kkr acquired all of the equity interests of prisma subject to potential purchase price payments in 2014 and 2017. at the time of the acquisition, kkr may have become contingently obligated to make future purchase price payments in 2017 based on whether the prisma business grows to achieve certain operating performance metrics when measured in such year. during the fourth quarter of 2016, kkr determined that it was no longer probable that the sellers (certain of whom are employees of kkr) of prisma capital partners lp and its affiliates would be entitled to any future additional payment under the contingent consideration arrangement. consequently, as of december 31, 2016, kkr has reduced the fair value of the contingent consideration liability to zero. additionally, on february 6, 2017, kkr and pacific alternative asset management company, llc, or paamco, announced that they entered into a strategic transaction to create a new liquid alternatives investment firm by combining paamco and kkr prisma. under the terms of the agreement, the entire businesses of both paamco and kkr prisma will be contributed to a newly formed company that will operate independently from kkr, and kkr will retain a 39.9% stake as a long-term strategic partner. this transaction is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the receipt of requisite regulatory approvals.

merchant capital solutions merchant capital solutions llc, or mcs, formerly known as merchcap solutions llc, was a joint venture partnership with stone point capital. during the year ended december 31, 2016, mcs became a consolidated subsidiary of kkr, and kkr has fully redeemed stone point capital's interest in mcs.
investment in marshall wace llp on november 2, 2015, kkr entered into a long-term strategic relationship with marshall wace llp and its affiliates and acquired a 24.9% interest in marshall wace through a combination of cash and common units. subject to the exercise of a put option by marshall wace or a call option by kkr, at subsequent closings to occur in the second, third and fourth years following the initial closing described above, and subject to satisfaction or waiver of certain closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, kkr may at each such closing subscribe (or be required to subscribe) for an incremental 5% equity interest, for ultimate aggregate ownership of up to 39.9% of marshall wace. the exercise of such options would require the use of cash and/or kkr common units. kkr's investment in marshall wace is accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
tax receivable agreement we and certain intermediate holding companies that are taxable corporations for u.s. federal, state and local income tax purposes, may be required to acquire kkr group partnership units from time to time pursuant to our exchange agreement with kkr holdings. kkr management holdings l.p. made an election under section 754 of the internal revenue code that will remain in effect for each taxable year in which an exchange of kkr group partnership units for common units occurs, which may result in an increase in our intermediate holding companies' share of the tax basis of the assets of the kkr group partnerships at the time of an exchange of kkr group partnership units. certain of these exchanges are expected to result in an increase in our intermediate holding companies' share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of the kkr group partnerships, primarily attributable to a portion of the goodwill inherent in our business that would not otherwise have been available. this increase in tax basis may increase depreciation and amortization deductions for tax purposes and therefore reduce the amount of income tax our intermediate holding companies would otherwise be required to pay in the future. this increase in tax basis may also decrease gain (or increase loss) on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those capital assets.
we have entered into a tax receivable agreement with kkr holdings, which requires our intermediate holding companies to pay to kkr holdings, or to current and former principals who have exchanged kkr holdings units for kkr common units as transferees of kkr group partnership units, 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in u.s. federal, state and local income tax that the intermediate holding companies realize as a result of the increase in tax basis described above, as well as 85% of the amount of any such savings the intermediate holding companies realize as a result of increases in tax basis that arise due to future payments under the agreement. we expect our intermediate holding companies to benefit from the remaining 15% of cash savings, if any, in income tax that they realize. a termination of the agreement or a change of control could give rise to similar payments based on tax savings that we would be deemed to realize in connection with such events. in the event that other of our current or future subsidiaries become taxable as corporations and acquire kkr group partnership units in the future, or if we become taxable as a corporation for u.s. federal income tax purposes, we expect that each will become subject to a tax receivable agreement with substantially similar terms.
these payment obligations are obligations of our intermediate holding companies and not the kkr group partnerships. as such, cash payments received by common unitholders may vary from those received by holders of kkr group partnership units held by kkr holdings and its current and former principals to the extent payments are made to those parties under the tax receivable agreement. payments made under the tax receivable agreement are required to be made within 90 days of the filing of the tax returns of our intermediate holding companies, which may result in a timing difference between the tax savings received by kkr's intermediate holdings companies and the cash payments made to the selling holders of kkr group partnership units.
for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, cash payments that have been made under the tax receivable agreement were $5.0 million, $5.7 million and $5.7 million, respectively. as of december 31, 2016, $4.2 million of cumulative income tax savings have been realized. see "-liquidity-other liquidity needs- contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies" for a discussion of amounts payable and cumulative cash payments made under this agreement.
distributions
160
a distribution of $0.16 per common unit has been declared, which will be paid on march 7, 2017 to holders of record of common units as of the close of business on february 21, 2017. under kkr's current distribution policy for its common units, kkr has made equal quarterly distributions to holders of common units in an amount of $0.16 per common unit per quarter. beginning with the financial results to be reported for the first quarter of 2017, kkr intends, subject to the limitations below, to increase its quarterly distribution to common unitholders to $0.17 per common unit per quarter.
a distribution of $0.421875 per series a preferred unit has been declared and set aside for payment on march 15, 2017 to holders of record of series a preferred units as of the close of business on march 1, 2017. a distribution of $0.406250 per series b preferred unit has been declared and set aside for payment on march 15, 2017 to holders of record of series b preferred units as of the close of business on march 1, 2017.
the declaration and payment of any future distributions on preferred or common units are subject to the discretion of the board of directors of the general partner of kkr and the terms of its limited partnership agreement. there can be no assurance that future distributions will be made as intended or at all, that unitholders will receive sufficient distributions to satisfy payment of their tax liabilities as limited partners of kkr or that any particular distribution policy for common units will be maintained. furthermore, the declaration and payment of distributions by the kkr group partnerships and our other subsidiaries may also be subject to legal, contractual and regulatory restrictions, including restrictions contained in our debt agreements and the preferred units of the kkr group partnerships.
when kkr & co. l.p. receives distributions from the kkr group partnerships (the holding companies of the kkr business), kkr holdings receives its pro rata share of such distributions from the kkr group partnerships.
other liquidity needs we may also be required to fund various underwriting and fronting commitments in our capital markets business in connection with the underwriting of loans, securities or other financial instruments. we generally expect that these commitments will be syndicated to third parties or otherwise fulfilled or terminated, although we may in some instances elect to retain a portion of the commitments for our own investment.
contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies on a consolidated basis in the ordinary course of business, we and our consolidated funds and cfes enter into contractual arrangements that may require future cash payments. the following table sets forth information relating to anticipated future cash payments as of december 31, 2016.

(1)   these uncalled commitments represent amounts committed by our consolidated investment funds, which include amounts committed by kkr and our fund investors, to fund the purchase price paid for each investment made by our investment funds which are actively investing. because capital contributions are due on demand, the above commitments have been presented as falling due within one year. however, given the size of such commitments and the rates at which our investment funds make investments, we expect that the capital commitments presented above will be called over a period of several years. see "-liquidity-liquidity needs."

we may incur contingent liabilities for claims that may be made against us in the future. we enter into contracts that contain a variety of representations, warranties and covenants, including indemnifications. for example, certain of our investment funds and kfn have provided certain indemnities relating to environmental and other matters and have provided nonrecourse carve-out guarantees for fraud, willful misconduct and other customary wrongful acts, each in connection with the financing of certain real estate investments that we have made. in addition, we have also provided credit support to certain of our subsidiaries' obligations in connection with a limited number of investment vehicles that we manage. for example, kkr has guaranteed the obligations of a general partner to post collateral on behalf of its investment vehicle in connection with such vehicle's derivative transactions, and we have also agreed to be liable for certain investment losses and/or for providing liquidity in the events specified in the governing documents of another investment vehicle. our maximum exposure under these arrangements is currently unknown as our liabilities for these matters would require a claim to be made against us in the future.
the partnership documents governing our carry-paying funds, including funds and vehicles relating to private equity, mezzanine, infrastructure, energy, direct lending and special situations investments, generally include a "clawback" provision that, if triggered, may give rise to a contingent obligation requiring the general partner to return amounts to the fund for distribution to the fund investors at the end of the life of the fund. under a clawback obligation, upon the liquidation of a fund, the general partner is required to return, typically on an after-tax basis, previously distributed carry to the extent that, due to the diminished performance of later investments, the aggregate amount of carry distributions received by the general partner during the term of the fund exceed the amount to which the general partner was ultimately entitled, including the effects of any performance thresholds. excluding carried interest received by the general partners of funds that were not contributed to us in the kpe transaction, as of december 31, 2016, no carried interest was subject to this clawback obligation, assuming that all applicable carry paying funds were liquidated at their december 31, 2016 fair values. had the investments in such funds been liquidated at zero value, the clawback obligation would have been $2,204.9 million. carried interest is recognized in the statement of operations based on the contractual conditions set forth in the agreements governing the fund as if the fund were terminated and liquidated at the reporting date and the fund's investments were realized at the then estimated fair values. amounts earned pursuant to carried interest are earned by the general partner of those funds to the extent that cumulative investment returns are positive and where applicable, preferred return thresholds have been met. if these investment amounts
163
earned decrease or turn negative in subsequent periods, recognized carried interest will be reversed and to the extent that the aggregate amount of carry distributions received by the general partner during the term of the fund exceed the amount to which the general partner was ultimately entitled, a clawback obligation would be recorded. for funds that are consolidated, this clawback obligation, if any, is reflected as an increase in noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of financial condition. for funds that are not consolidated, this clawback obligation, if any, is reflected as a reduction of our investment balance as this is where carried interest is initially recorded.
prior to the kpe transaction in 2009, certain principals who received carried interest distributions with respect to certain private equity funds contributed to us had personally guaranteed, on a several basis and subject to a cap, the contingent obligations of the general partners of such private equity funds to repay amounts to fund investors pursuant to the general partners' clawback obligations. the terms of the kpe transaction require that principals remain responsible for any clawback obligations relating to carry distributions received prior to the kpe transaction, up to a maximum of $223.6 million. through investment realizations, the principals' potential exposure has been reduced to $98.9 million as of december 31, 2016. using valuations as of december 31, 2016, no amounts are due with respect to the clawback obligation required to be funded by principals. carry distributions arising subsequent to the kpe transaction may give rise to clawback obligations that may be allocated generally to us and to persons who participate in the carry pool. in addition, guarantees of or similar arrangements relating to clawback obligations in favor of third party investors in an individual investment partnership by entities we own may limit distributions of carried interest more generally.
off balance sheet arrangements other than contractual commitments and other legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of our business, we do not have any off-balance sheet financings or liabilities.
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of fees, expenses and investment income. our management bases these estimates and judgments on available information, historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. however, these estimates, judgments and assumptions are often subjective and may be impacted negatively based on changing circumstances or changes in our analyses. if actual amounts are ultimately different from those estimated, judged or assumed, revisions are included in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which the actual amounts become known. we believe our critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying estimates, judgments or assumptions.
the following discussion details certain of our critical accounting policies. for a full discussion of all critical accounting policies, please see the notes to the consolidated financial statements "--item 8. consolidated financial statements--summary of significant accounting policies."
fair value measurements fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. except for certain of kkr's equity method investments and debt obligations, kkr's investments and other financial instruments are recorded at fair value or at amounts whose carrying values approximate fair value. where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. where observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation techniques are applied. these valuation techniques involve varying levels of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on a variety of factors.
gaap establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework which prioritizes and ranks the level of market price observability used in measuring financial instruments at fair value. market price observability is affected by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, the characteristics specific to the financial instrument and the state of the marketplace, including the existence and transparency of transactions between market participants. financial instruments with readily available quoted prices in active markets generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment used in measuring fair value.
financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed based on the observability of inputs used in the determination of fair values, as follows:
164
level i pricing inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the measurement date. the types of financial instruments included in this category are publicly-listed equities, credit investments and securities sold short.
we classified 8.2% of total investments measured and reported at fair value as level i at december 31, 2016.
level ii pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date, and fair value is determined through the use of models or other valuation methodologies. the types of financial instruments included in this category are credit investments, investments and debt obligations of consolidated clo entities, convertible debt securities indexed to publicly-listed securities, less liquid and restricted equity securities and certain over-the-counter derivatives such as foreign currency option and forward contracts.
we classified 38.6% of total investments measured and reported at fair value as level ii at december 31, 2016.
level iii pricing inputs are unobservable for the financial instruments and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the financial instrument. the inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. the types of financial instruments generally included in this category are private portfolio companies, real assets investments, credit investments, equity method investments for which the fair value option was elected and investments and debt obligations of consolidated cmbs entities.
we classified 53.2% of total investments measured and reported at fair value as level iii at december 31, 2016. the valuation of our level iii investments at december 31, 2016 represents management's best estimate of the amounts that we would anticipate realizing on the sale of these investments in an orderly transaction at such date.
in certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. in such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the asset.
a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability is an indication that transactions or quoted prices may not be representative of fair value because in such market conditions there may be increased instances of transactions that are not orderly. in those circumstances, further analysis of transactions or quoted prices is needed, and a significant adjustment to the transactions or quoted prices may be necessary to estimate fair value.
the availability of observable inputs can vary depending on the financial asset or liability and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of instrument, whether the instrument has recently been issued, whether the instrument is traded on an active exchange or in the secondary market, and current market conditions. to the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by us in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in level iii. the variability and availability of the observable inputs affected by the factors described above may cause transfers between levels i, ii, and iii, which we recognize at the beginning of the reporting period.
investments and other financial instruments that have readily observable market prices (such as those traded on a securities exchange) are stated at the last quoted sales price as of the reporting date. we do not adjust the quoted price for these investments, even in situations where we hold a large position and a sale could reasonably affect the quoted price.
management's determination of fair value is based upon the methodologies and processes described below and may incorporate assumptions that are management's best estimates after consideration of a variety of internal and external factors.
level ii valuation methodologies
165
credit investments: these instruments generally have bid and ask prices that can be observed in the marketplace. bid prices reflect the highest price that kkr and others are willing to pay for an instrument. ask prices represent the lowest price that kkr and others are willing to accept for an instrument. for financial assets and liabilities whose inputs are based on bid-ask prices obtained from third party pricing services, fair value may not always be a predetermined point in the bid-ask range. kkr's policy is generally to allow for mid-market pricing and adjusting to the point within the bid-ask range that meets kkr's best estimate of fair value.
investments and debt obligations of consolidated clo vehicles: investments of consolidated clo vehicles are valued using the same valuation methodology as described above for credit investments. under asu 2014-13, kkr measures clo debt obligations on the basis of the fair value of the financial assets of the clo.
securities indexed to publicly-listed securities: the securities are typically valued using standard convertible security pricing models. the key inputs into these models that require some amount of judgment are the credit spreads utilized and the volatility assumed. to the extent the company being valued has other outstanding debt securities that are publicly-traded, the implied credit spread on the company's other outstanding debt securities would be utilized in the valuation. to the extent the company being valued does not have other outstanding debt securities that are publicly-traded, the credit spread will be estimated based on the implied credit spreads observed in comparable publicly-traded debt securities. in certain cases, an additional spread will be added to reflect an illiquidity discount due to the fact that the security being valued is not publicly-traded. the volatility assumption is based upon the historically observed volatility of the underlying equity security into which the convertible debt security is convertible and/or the volatility implied by the prices of options on the underlying equity security.
restricted equity securities: the valuation of certain equity securities is based on an observable price for an identical security adjusted for the effect of a restriction.
derivatives: the valuation incorporates observable inputs comprising yield curves, foreign currency rates and credit spreads.
level iii valuation methodologies financial assets and liabilities categorized as level iii consist primarily of the following:
private equity investments: we generally employ two valuation methodologies when determining the fair value of a private equity investment. the first methodology is typically a market comparables analysis that considers key financial inputs and recent public and private transactions and other available measures. the second methodology utilized is typically a discounted cash flow analysis, which incorporates significant assumptions and judgments. estimates of key inputs used in this methodology include the weighted average cost of capital for the investment and assumed inputs used to calculate terminal values, such as exit ebitda multiples. in certain cases the results of the discounted cash flow approach can be significantly impacted by these estimates. other inputs are also used in both methodologies. also, as discussed in greater detail under "-business environment" in this report and "risk factors-risks related to the assets we manage-our investments are impacted by various economic conditions that are difficult to quantify or predict, but may have a significant adverse impact on the value of our investments" in our annual report, a change in interest rates could have a significant impact on valuations. in addition, when a definitive agreement has been executed to sell an investment, kkr generally considers a significant determinant of fair value to be the consideration to be received by kkr pursuant to the executed definitive agreement.
upon completion of the valuations conducted using these methodologies, a weighting is ascribed to each method, and an illiquidity discount is typically applied where appropriate. the ultimate fair value recorded for a particular investment will generally be within a range suggested by the two methodologies, except that the value may be higher or lower than such range in the case of investments being sold pursuant to an executed definitive agreement.
when determining the weighting ascribed to each valuation methodology, we consider, among other factors, the availability of direct market comparables, the applicability of a discounted cash flow analysis, the expected hold period and manner of realization for the investment, and in the case of investments being sold pursuant to an executed definitive agreement, we estimated probability of such a sale being completed. these factors can result in different weightings among investments in the portfolio and in certain instances may result in up to a 100% weighting to a single methodology. across the total level iii private equity investment portfolio, including investments in both consolidated and unconsolidated investment funds, approximately 69% of the fair value is derived from investments that are valued based exactly 50% on market comparables and 50% on a discounted cash flow analysis. less than 5% of the fair value of this level iii private equity investment portfolio is derived from investments that are valued either based 100% on market comparables or 100% on a
166
discounted cash flow analysis. as of december 31, 2016, the overall weights ascribed to the market comparables methodology, the discounted cash flow methodology and a methodology based on pending sales for this portfolio of level iii private equity investments were 38%, 44% and 18%, respectively.
when an illiquidity discount is to be applied, we seek to take a uniform approach across our portfolio and generally apply a minimum 5% discount to all private equity investments. we then evaluate such private equity investments to determine if factors exist that could make it more challenging to monetize the investment and, therefore, justify applying a higher illiquidity discount. these factors generally include (i) whether we are unable to freely sell the portfolio company or conduct an initial public offering of the portfolio company due to the consent rights of a third party or similar factors, (ii) whether the portfolio company is undergoing significant restructuring activity or similar factors and (iii) characteristics about the portfolio company regarding its size and/or whether the portfolio company is experiencing, or expected to experience, a significant decline in earnings. these factors generally make it less likely that a portfolio company would be sold or publicly offered in the near term at a price indicated by using just a market multiples and/or discounted cash flow analysis, and these factors tend to reduce the number of opportunities to sell an investment and/or increase the time horizon over which an investment may be monetized. depending on the applicability of these factors, we determine the amount of any incremental illiquidity discount to be applied above the 5% minimum, and during the time we hold the investment, the illiquidity discount may be increased or decreased, from time to time, based on changes to these factors. the amount of illiquidity discount applied at any time requires considerable judgment about what a market participant would consider and is based on the facts and circumstances of each individual investment. accordingly, the illiquidity discount ultimately considered by a market participant upon the realization of any investment may be higher or lower than that estimated by us in our valuations.
in the case of growth equity investments, enterprise values may be determined using the market comparables analysis and discounted cash flow analysis described above. a scenario analysis may also be conducted to subject the estimated enterprise values to a downside, base and upside case, which involves significant assumptions and judgments. a milestone analysis may also be conducted to assess the current level of progress towards value drivers that we have determined to be important, which involves significant assumptions and judgments. the enterprise value in each case may then be allocated across the investment's capital structure to reflect the terms of the security and subjected to probability weightings.  in certain cases, the values of growth equity investments may be based on recent or expected financings.
real assets investments: real asset investments in infrastructure, energy and real estate are valued using one or more of the discounted cash flow analysis, market comparables analysis and direct income capitalization, which in each case incorporates significant assumptions and judgments. infrastructure investments are generally valued using the discounted cash flow analysis. key inputs used in this methodology can include the weighted average cost of capital and assumed inputs used to calculate terminal values, such as exit ebitda multiples. energy investments are generally valued using a discounted cash flow analysis. key inputs used in this methodology that require estimates include the weighted average cost of capital. in addition, the valuations of energy investments generally incorporate both commodity prices as quoted on indices and long-term commodity price forecasts, which may be substantially different from, and are currently higher than, commodity prices on certain indices for equivalent future dates. certain energy investments do not include an illiquidity discount. long-term commodity price forecasts are utilized to capture the value of the investments across a range of commodity prices within the energy investment portfolio associated with future development and to reflect a range of price expectations. real estate investments are generally valued using a combination of direct income capitalization and discounted cash flow analysis. key inputs used in such methodologies that require estimates include an unlevered discount rate and current capitalization rate, and certain real estate investments do not include a minimum illiquidity discount. the valuations of real assets investments also use other inputs.
on a segment basis, our energy real asset investments in oil and gas producing properties as of december 31, 2016 had a fair value of approximately $559 million. based on this fair value, we estimate that an immediate, hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of these energy investments from one or more adverse movements to the investments' valuation inputs would result in a decline in investment income of $55.9 million and a decline in net income attributable to kkr & co. l.p. of $31.4 million, after deducting amounts that are attributable to noncontrolling interests held by kkr holdings l.p. as of december 31, 2016, if we were to value our energy investments using only the commodity prices as quoted on indices and did not use long-term commodity price forecasts, and also held all other inputs to their valuation constant, we estimate that investment income would have been approximately $37 million lower, resulting in a lower amount of net income attributable to kkr & co. l.p. of approximately 56.1% of the overall decrease in investment income, after deducting amounts that are attributable to noncontrolling interests held by kkr holdings l.p.
these hypothetical declines relate only to investment income. there would be no current impact on kkr's carried interest since all of the investment funds which hold these types of energy investments have investment values that are either below their cost or not currently accruing carried interest. additionally, there would be no impact on fees since fees earned from
167
investment funds which hold investments in oil and gas producing properties are based on either committed capital or capital invested.
for gaap purposes, where kkr holds energy investments consisting of working interests in oil and gas producing properties directly and not through an investment fund, such working interests are consolidated based on the proportion of the working interests held by us. accordingly, we reflect the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, investment income and cash flows of the consolidated working interests on a gross basis and changes in the value of these energy investments are not reflected as unrealized gains and losses in the consolidated statements of operations. accordingly, a change in fair value for these investments does not result in a decrease in net gains (losses) from investment activities, but may result in an impairment charge reflected in general, administrative and other expenses. for segment purposes, these directly held working interests are treated as investments and changes in value are reflected in our segment results as unrealized gains and losses.
credit investments: credit investments are valued using values obtained from dealers or market makers, and where these values are not available, credit investments are generally valued by us based on ranges of valuations determined by an independent valuation firm. valuation models are based on discounted cash flow analyses, for which the key inputs are determined based on market comparables, which incorporate similar instruments from similar issuers.
other investments:  with respect to other investments including equity method investments for which the fair value election has been made, we generally employ the same valuation methodologies as described above for private equity investments when valuing these other investments.
investments and debt obligations of consolidated cmbs vehicles: under asu 2014-13, we measure cmbs investments on the basis of the fair value of the financial liabilities of the cmbs. debt obligations of consolidated cmbs vehicles are valued based on discounted cash flow analyses. the key input is the expected yield of each cmbs security using both observable and unobservable factors, which may include recently offered or completed trades and published yields of similar securities, security-specific characteristics (e.g. securities ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, credit support by other subordinate securities issued by the cmbs and coupon type) and other characteristics.
key unobservable inputs that have a significant impact on our level iii investment valuations as described above are included in note 5 "fair value measurements" of the financial statements included elsewhere in this report. we utilize several unobservable pricing inputs and assumptions in determining the fair value of our level iii investments. these unobservable pricing inputs and assumptions may differ by investment and in the application of our valuation methodologies. our reported fair value estimates could vary materially if we had chosen to incorporate different unobservable pricing inputs and other assumptions or, for applicable investments, if we only used either the discounted cash flow methodology or the market comparables methodology instead of assigning a weighting to both methodologies. for valuations determined for periods other than at year end, various inputs may be estimated prior to the end of the relevant period.
level iii valuation process the valuation process involved for level iii measurements is completed on a quarterly basis and is designed to subject the valuation of level iii investments to an appropriate level of consistency, oversight, and review.
for private markets investments classified as level iii, investment professionals prepare preliminary valuations based on their evaluation of financial and operating data, company specific developments, market valuations of comparable companies and other factors. these preliminary valuations are reviewed by an independent valuation firm engaged by kkr to perform certain procedures in order to assess the reasonableness of kkr's valuations annually for all level iii investments in private markets and quarterly for investments other than certain investments, which have values less than pre-set value thresholds and which in the aggregate comprise less than 5% of the total value of kkr's level iii private markets investments. the valuations of certain real asset investments are determined solely by an independent valuation firm without the preparation of preliminary valuations by our investment professionals, and instead such independent valuation firm relies on valuation information available to it as a broker or valuation firm. for credit investments and debt obligations of consolidated cmbs vehicles, an independent valuation firm is generally engaged by kkr with respect to most investments classified as level iii. the valuation firm either provides a valuation range from which kkr's investment professionals select a point in the range to determine the preliminary valuation or performs certain procedures in order to assess the reasonableness and provide positive assurance of kkr's valuations. after reflecting any input from the independent valuation firm, the valuation proposals are submitted to their respective valuation sub-committees. as of december 31, 2016, less than 6% of the total value of our level iii credit investments are not valued with the engagement of an independent valuation firm.
168
kkr has a global valuation committee comprised of senior employees including investment professionals and professionals from business operations functions, and includes our chief financial officer, general counsel and chief compliance officer. the global valuation committee is assisted by valuation sub-committees and investment professionals for each business strategy. all preliminary level iii valuations are reviewed and approved by the valuation sub-committees for private equity, real estate, energy and infrastructure and credit, as applicable. when level iii valuations are required to be performed on hedge fund investments, a valuation sub-committee for hedge funds reviews these valuations. the valuation sub-committees are responsible for the review and approval of valuations in their respective business lines on a quarterly basis. the members of the valuation sub-committees are comprised of investment professionals, including the heads of each respective strategy, and professionals from business operations functions such as legal, compliance and finance, who are not primarily responsible for the management of the investments.
the global valuation committee provides general oversight of the valuation sub-committees. the global valuation committee is responsible for coordinating and implementing the firm's valuation process to ensure consistency in the application of valuation principles across portfolio investments and between periods. all valuations are subject to approval by the global valuation committee. when valuations are approved by the global valuation committee after reflecting any input from it, the valuations of level iii investments, as well as the valuations of level i and level ii investments, are presented to the audit committee of the board of directors of the general partner of kkr & co. l.p. and are then reported to the board of directors.
as of december 31, 2016, upon completion by, where applicable, an independent valuation firm of certain limited procedures requested to be performed by them on certain investments, the independent valuation firm concluded that the fair values, as determined by kkr, of those investments reviewed by them were reasonable. the limited procedures did not involve an audit, review, compilation or any other form of examination or attestation under generally accepted auditing standards and were not conducted on all level iii investments. we are responsible for determining the fair value of investments in good faith, and the limited procedures performed by an independent valuation firm are supplementary to the inquiries and procedures that we are required to undertake to determine the fair value of the commensurate investments.
as described above, level ii and level iii investments were valued using internal models with significant unobservable inputs and our determinations of the fair values of these investments may differ materially from the values that would have resulted if readily observable inputs had existed. additional external factors may cause those values, and the values of investments for which readily observable inputs exist, to increase or decrease over time, which may create volatility in our earnings and the amounts of assets and partners' capital that we report from time to time.
changes in the fair value of investments impacts the amount of carried interest that is recognized as well as the amount of investment income that is recognized for investments held directly and through our consolidated funds as described below. we estimate that an immediate 10% decrease in the fair value of investments held directly and through consolidated investment funds generally would result in a commensurate change in the amount of net gains (losses) from investment activities for investments held directly and through investment funds and a more significant impact to the amount of carried interest recognized, regardless of whether the investment was valued using observable market prices or management estimates with significant unobservable pricing inputs. with respect to consolidated investment funds, the impact that the consequential decrease in investment income would have on net income attributable to kkr would generally be significantly less than the amount described above, given that a majority of the change in fair value of our consolidated funds would be attributable to noncontrolling interests and therefore we are only impacted to the extent of our carried interest and our balance sheet investments.
as of december 31, 2016, there were no investments which represented greater than 5% of total investments on a gaap basis. on a segment basis, as of december 31, 2016, investments which represented greater than 5% of total reportable segments investments consisted of only first data corporation valued at $1,094.2 million. our investment income can be impacted by volatility in the public markets related to our holdings of publicly traded securities, including our sizable holdings of first data corporation (nyse: fdc). for the year ended december 31, 2016, the reduction in the stock price of first data corporation reduced economic net income on a segment basis by approximately $180 million. see "--business environment" for a discussion on the impact of global equity markets on our financial condition and "--segment balance sheet" for additional information regarding our largest holdings on a segment basis.
recognition of investment income on january 1, 2016, kkr adopted asu 2015-02, which resulted in the de-consolidation of most of kkr's investment funds that had been consolidated prior to such date. as a result of this adoption, the net gains (losses) from investment
169
activities attributed to third party limited partners in our investment funds that had previously been consolidated are not included in the statement of operations effective with the adoption of asu 2015-02 on january 1, 2016.
investment income consists primarily of the net impact of: (i) realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments, (ii) dividends, (iii) interest income, (iv) interest expense and (v) foreign exchange gains and losses relating to mark-to-market activity on foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency options, foreign denominated debt and debt securities issued by consolidated cfes. unrealized gains or losses resulting from the aforementioned activities are included in net gains (losses) from investment activities. upon disposition of an instrument that is marked-to-market, previously recognized unrealized gains or losses are reversed and a realized gain or loss is recognized. while this reversal generally does not significantly impact the net amounts of gains (losses) that we recognize from investment activities, it affects the manner in which we classify our gains and losses for reporting purposes.
subsequent to the adoption of asu 2015-02, certain of our investment funds continue to be consolidated. when a fund is consolidated, the portion of our funds' investment income that is allocable to our carried interests and capital investments is not shown in the consolidated financial statements. for funds that are consolidated, all investment income (loss), including the portion of a funds' investment income (loss) that is allocable to kkr's carried interest, is included in investment income (loss) on the consolidated statements of operations. the carried interest that kkr retains in net income (loss) attributable to kkr & co. l.p. is reflected as an adjustment to net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. however, because certain of our funds remain consolidated and because we hold a minority economic interest in these funds' investments, our share of the investment income is less than the total amount of investment income presented in the consolidated financial statements for these consolidated funds.
recognition of carried interest in the statement of operations carried interest entitles the general partner of a fund to a greater allocable share of the fund's earnings from investments relative to the capital contributed by the general partner and correspondingly reduces noncontrolling interests' attributable share of those earnings. carried interest is earned by the general partner of those funds to the extent that cumulative investment returns are positive and where applicable, preferred return thresholds have been met. if these investment returns decrease or turn negative in subsequent periods, recognized carried interest will be reversed and reflected as losses in the statement of operations. for funds that are not consolidated, amounts earned pursuant to carried interest are included in fees and other in the consolidated statements of operations. amounts earned pursuant to carried interest at consolidated funds are eliminated from fees and other upon consolidation of the fund and are included as investment income (loss) in net gains (losses) from investment activities along with all of the other investment gains and losses at the consolidated fund.
on january 1, 2016, kkr adopted asu 2015-02, which resulted in the de-consolidation of most of kkr's investment funds that had been consolidated prior to such date. as a result of this adoption, most of the carried interest earned from unconsolidated funds is no longer eliminated in consolidation and is reflected in fees and other subsequent to the adoption.
carried interest is recognized in the statement of operations based on the contractual conditions set forth in the agreements governing the fund as if the fund were terminated and liquidated at the reporting date and the fund's investments were realized at the then estimated fair values. due to the extended durations of our private equity funds, we believe that this approach results in income recognition that best reflects our periodic performance in the management of those funds. amounts earned pursuant to carried interest are earned by the general partner of those funds to the extent that cumulative investment returns are positive and where applicable, preferred return thresholds have been met. if these investment amounts earned decrease or turn negative in subsequent periods, recognized carried interest will be reversed and to the extent that the aggregate amount of carry distributions received by the general partner during the term of the fund exceed the amount to which the general partner was ultimately entitled, a clawback obligation would be recorded. for funds that are not consolidated, this clawback obligation, if any, is reflected as a reduction of our investment balance as this is where carried interest is initially recorded. for funds that are consolidated, this clawback obligation, if any, is reflected as an increase in noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of financial condition.
prior to january 1, 2016, most of our historical private equity funds that provide for carried interest do not have a preferred return. for these funds, the management company is required to refund up to 20% of any management fees earned from its limited partners in the event that the fund recognizes carried interest. at such time as the fund recognizes carried interest in an amount sufficient to cover 20% of the management fees earned or a portion thereof, a liability due to the fund's limited partners is recorded and revenue is reduced for the amount of the carried interest recognized, not to exceed 20% of the management fees earned. the refunds to the limited partners are paid, and liabilities relieved, at such time that the underlying investment is sold and the associated carried interest is realized. in the event that a fund's carried interest is not sufficient to cover all or a portion
170
of the amount that represents 20% of the earned management fees, such management fees would be retained and not returned to the funds' limited partners.
most of our newer investment funds that provide for carried interest, however, have a preferred return. in this case, the management company does not refund the management fees earned from the limited partners of the fund as described above. instead, the management fee is effectively returned to the limited partners through a reduction of the realized gain on which carried interest is calculated. to calculate the carried interest, kkr calculates whether a preferred return has been achieved based on an amount that includes all of the management fees paid by the limited partners as well as the other capital contributions and expenses paid by them to date. to the extent the fund has exceeded the preferred return at the time of a realization event, and subject to any other conditions for the payment of carried interest like netting holes, carried interest is distributed to the general partner. until the preferred return is achieved, no carried interest is recorded. thereafter, the general partner is entitled to a catch up allocation such that the general partner's carried interest is paid in respect of all of the fund's net gains, including the net gains used to pay the preferred return, until the general partner has received the full percentage amount of carried interest that the general partner is entitled to under the terms of the fund. in general, investment funds that entitle the management company to receive an incentive fee have a preferred return and are calculated on a similar basis that takes into account management fees paid.

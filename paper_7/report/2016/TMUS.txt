business overview we introduced our un-carrier strategy in 2013 with the objective of eliminating customer pain points from the unnecessary complexity of the wireless communication industry. since that time, we have continued our efforts with the launch of additional initiatives of our un-carrier strategy. during 2016, we launched the following un-carrier initiatives:
•   in june 2016, we introduced #getthanked, a history-making move dedicated exclusively to saying "thank you" to our customers. this program, offered to our customers as part of their t-mobile service: (i) offers eligible new (through december 31, 2016) or existing (as of june 6, 2016) customers ownership in the company with a free share of t-
23
mobile stock or an additional share of t-mobile stock for every new active account each customer refers through december 31, 2016, subject to a maximum of 100 shares in a calendar year, (ii) enables eligible customers who download the t-mobile tuesday app to be informed about and to redeem products and services offered by participating business partners each tuesday and (iii) offers eligible customers a full hour of free in-flight wi-fi on their smartphone on all gogo-equipped domestic flights.
•   in september 2016, we introduced our t-mobile one plan, a move that gives our customers unlimited calls, unlimited text and unlimited high-speed 4g long term evolution (lte) data. on t-mobile one, video typically streams at dvd (480p) quality and tethering is at maximum 3g speeds. customers can choose to add on additional features to t-mobile one for an additional cost. on t-mobile one plus customers also receive unlimited high definition video day passes, voicemail to text, nameid, unlimited gogo in-flight internet passes on capable domestic flights and up to two times faster speeds when traveling abroad in 140+ countries and destinations. on t-mobile one plus international, customers receive the benefits of t-mobile one plus as well as free and reduced calling from the u.s. to foreign countries and unlimited high-speed 4g lte mobile hotspot data.
•   in january 2017, we introduced, un-carrier next, where monthly wireless service fees and all taxes are included in the advertised monthly recurring charge for t-mobile one. we also unveiled kickback on t-mobile one, where participating customers who use 2 gb or less of data in a month, will get up to a $10 credit on their next month's bill per qualifying line. in addition, we introduced the un-contract for t-mobile one with the first-ever price guarantee on an unlimited 4g lte plan which allows t-mobile one customers to keep their price for service until they decide to change it.
our ability to acquire and retain branded customers is important to our business in the generation of revenues and we believe our un-carrier strategy, along with ongoing network improvements, has been successful in attracting and retaining customers as evidenced by continued branded customer growth and improved branded postpaid phone and branded prepaid customer churn.

during the year ended december 31, 2016, a handset oem announced recalls on certain of its smartphone devices. as a result, we recorded no revenue associated with the device sales to customers and impaired the devices to their net realizable value. the oem has agreed to reimburse t-mobile for direct and indirect costs associated with the recall, as such, we have recorded an amount due from the oem as an offset to the loss recorded in cost of equipment sales and the costs incurred within selling, general and administrative in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income and a reduction to accounts payable and accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.

results of operations
2016 highlights
•   total revenues increased $5.2 billion, or 16%, to $37.2 billion in 2016 primarily driven by growth in service and equipment revenues as further discussed below. the mvno transaction shifted branded postpaid revenues to wholesale revenues, but did not materially impact total revenues.
•   service revenues increased $3.0 billion, or 12%, to $27.8 billion in 2016 primarily due to growth in our average branded customer base as a result of strong customer response to our un-carrier initiatives and the success of our metropcs brand and continued growth in new markets.
•   equipment revenues increased $2.0 billion, or 30%, to $8.7 billion in 2016 primarily as a result of higher lease revenues, which are recognized over the lease term, resulting from the launch of our jump! on demand program at the end of the second quarter of 2015, an increase in the number of devices sold and a higher average revenue per device sold.
•   operating income increased $1.7 billion, or 84%, to $3.8 billion in 2016 primarily due to higher total revenues as well as increased gains on disposals of spectrum licenses, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization from an increase in the number of devices leased under our jump! on demand program, higher costs of equipment sales primarily from an increase in the number of devices sold and a higher average cost per device and higher selling, general and administrative expenses to support customer growth and retention.
•   net income increased $727 million, or 99%, to $1.5 billion in 2016 primarily due to higher operating income driven by the factors described above, partially offset by higher interest expense related to higher average debt and higher income tax expense. additionally, 2016 included $509 million of net, after-tax gains on disposal of spectrum licenses compared to $100 million in 2015.
•   adjusted ebitda increased $3.0 billion, or 41%, to $10.4 billion in 2016 primarily from higher service revenues and gains on disposal of spectrum licenses, partially offset by increases in selling, general and administrative expenses to support customer growth. lower losses on equipment in 2016 primarily due to an increase in lease revenues resulting from the launch of our jump! on demand program at the end of the second quarter of 2015. revenues associated with leased devices are recognized over the lease term.
•   net cash provided by operating activities increased $721 million, or 13%, to $6.1 billion in 2016. the increase was primarily due to an increase in net non-cash income and expenses included in net income primarily due to changes in depreciation and amortization, deferred income tax expense and gains on disposal of spectrum licenses expense, as well as an increase in net income. the increase was partially offset by an increase in net cash outflows from changes in working capital.
•   free cash flow increased $743 million, or 108%, to $1.4 billion in 2016. the increase was primarily from higher net cash provided by operating activities as discussed above. cash purchases of property and equipment includes capitalized interest of $142 million and $246 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively.

nm - not meaningful comparing 2016 results with 2015 results total revenues increased $5.2 billion or 16% primarily due to:
branded postpaid revenues increased $1.8 billion or 11% primarily from:
•   a 13% increase in the number of average branded postpaid phone and mobile broadband customers, driven by strong customer response to our un-carrier initiatives and promotions for services and devices;
•   higher device insurance program revenues primarily from customer growth; and
•   higher regulatory program revenues; partially offset by
•   an increase in the non-cash net revenue deferral for data stash; and
•   the impact of reduced branded postpaid revenues resulting from the mvno transaction.
26
branded prepaid revenues increased $1.0 billion or 13% primarily from:
•   a 13% increase in the number of average branded prepaid customers driven by the success of our metropcs brand; and
•   continued growth in new markets.
wholesale revenues increased $211 million or 30% primarily from:
•   the impact of the increased wholesale revenues resulting from the mvno transaction;
•   growth in customers of certain mvno partners; and
•   an increase in data usage per customer.
roaming and other service revenues increased $57 million or 30% primarily due to higher international roaming revenues driven by an increase in inbound roaming volumes.
equipment revenues increased $2.0 billion or 30% primarily from:
•   an increase of $1.2 billion in lease revenues resulting from the launch of our jump! on demand program at the end of the second quarter of 2015. revenues associated with leased devices are recognized over the lease term.
•   an increase of $570 million in device sales revenues, primarily due to a 9% increase in the number of devices sold. device sales revenue is recognized at the time of sale.
gross eip device financing to our customers increased by $923 million to $6.1 billion primarily due to an increase in devices financed due to our focus on eip sales in 2016, compared to focus on devices financed on jump! on demand after the launch of the program at the end of the second quarter of 2015.
other revenues increased $157 million or 31% primarily from:
•   higher revenue from revenue share agreements with third parties; and
•   an increase in co-location rental income from leasing space on wireless communication towers to third parties.
our operating expenses consist of the following categories:
•   cost of services consists primarily of costs directly attributable to providing wireless service through the operation of our network, including direct switch and cell site costs, such as rent, network access and transport costs, utilities, maintenance, associated labor costs, long distance costs, regulatory program costs, roaming fees paid to other carriers and data content costs.
•   cost of equipment sales consists primarily of costs of devices and accessories sold to customers and dealers, device costs to fulfill insurance and warranty claims, costs related to returned and purchased leased devices, write-downs of inventory related to shrinkage and obsolescence, and shipping and handling costs.
•   selling, general and administrative consists of costs not directly attributable to providing wireless service for the operation of sales, customer care and corporate activities. these include commissions paid to dealers and retail employees for activations and upgrades, labor and facilities costs associated with retail sales force and administrative space, marketing and promotional costs, customer support and billing, bad debt expense, losses from sales of receivables and back office administrative support activities.
operating expenses increased $3.5 billion or 12% primarily due to:
cost of services increased $177 million or 3% primarily from:
•   higher regulatory program costs and expenses associated with network expansion and the build-out of our network to utilize our 700 mhz a-block spectrum licenses, including higher employee-related costs; partially offset by
•   lower long distance and toll costs; and
•   synergies realized from the decommissioning of the metropcs cdma network.
27
cost of equipment sales increased $1.5 billion or 16% primarily from:
•   a 9% increase in the number of devices sold; and
•   an increase in the impact from returned and purchased leased devices.
under our jump! on demand program, the cost of the leased wireless device is capitalized and recognized as depreciation expense over the term of the lease rather than recognized as cost of equipment sales when the device is delivered to the customer. additionally, upon device upgrade or at lease end, customers must return or purchase their device.  returned devices transferred from property and equipment, net are recorded as inventory and are valued at the lower of cost or market with any write-down to market recognized as cost of equipment sales.
selling, general and administrative increased $1.2 billion or 12% primarily from strategic investments to support our growing customer base including higher:
•   employee-related costs;
•   commissions driven by an increase in branded customer additions; and
•   promotional costs.
depreciation and amortization increased $1.6 billion or 33% primarily from:
•   $1.5 billion in depreciation expense related to devices leased under our jump! on demand program launched at the end of the second quarter of 2015. under our jump! on demand program, the cost of a leased wireless device is depreciated over the lease term to its estimated residual value. the total number of devices under lease was higher year-over-year, resulting in higher depreciation expense; and
•   the continued build-out of our 4g lte network.
cost of metropcs business combination decreased $272 million or 72% primarily from lower network decommissioning costs. in 2014, we began decommissioning the metropcs cdma network and certain other redundant network cell sites as part of the business combination. on july 1, 2015, we officially completed the shutdown of the metropcs cdma network. network decommissioning costs, which are excluded from adjusted ebitda, primarily relate to the acceleration of lease costs for cell sites that would have otherwise been recognized as cost of services over the remaining lease term had we not decommissioned the cell sites. although we expect to incur additional network decommissioning costs in 2017, these costs are not expected to be significant.
gains on disposal of spectrum licenses increased $672 million primarily from a $636 million gain from a spectrum license transaction with at&t recorded in the first quarter of 2016 and $199 million from other transactions in 2016, compared to $163 million in 2015. see note 5 - goodwill, spectrum licenses and other intangible assets of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
net income increased $727 million or 99% primarily from:
•   operating income, the components of which are discussed above, increased $1.7 billion or 84% and
•   interest expense to affiliates decreased $99 million or 24% primarily from:
•   changes in the fair value of embedded derivative instruments associated with our senior reset notes issued to deutsch telekom in 2015; partially offset by
•   higher interest rates on certain senior reset notes issued to deutsch telekom, which were adjusted at reset dates in the second quarter of 2016 and in 2015. partially offset by:
•   income tax expense increased $622 million or 254% primarily from:
•   higher income before income taxes; and
•   a higher effective tax rate. the effective tax rate was 37.3% in 2016, compared to 25.1% in 2015. the increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to income tax benefits for discrete income tax items recognized in 2015 that did not impact 2016; partially offset by the recognition of $58 million of excess
28
tax benefits related to share-based payments following the adoption of asu 2016-09 as of january 1, 2016. see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. based on recent earnings in certain jurisdictions, sufficient positive evidence may exist within the next twelve months such that we may release a portion of our valuation allowance.
•   interest expense increased $333 million or 31% primarily from:
•   higher average debt balances with third parties; and
•   lower capitalized interest costs of $83 million primarily due to a higher level of build out of our network to utilize our 700 mhz a-block spectrum licenses in 2015, compared to 2016.
•   interest income decreased $159 million or 38% primarily due to $166 million lower imputed interest income associated with devices financed through eip resulting from:
•   an increase in sales of certain eip receivables pursuant to our eip receivables sales arrangement resulting from an increase in the maximum funding commitment in june 2016. interest associated with eip receivables is imputed at the time of a device sale and then recognized over the financed installment term. see note 2 - equipment installment plan receivables of the notes to the consolidated financial statements; and
•   focus on devices financed on jump! on demand in the third and fourth quarters of 2015 following the launch of the program of at the end of the second quarter 2015.
we are making an accounting change in 2017 to include imputed interest associated with eip receivables in other revenues in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. the impact from this accounting change is expected to be approximately $0.2 to $0.3 billion in 2017.
net income during 2016 and 2015 included net, after-tax gains on disposal of spectrum licenses of $509 million and $100 million, respectively.

•   growth in the number of average branded postpaid and mobile broadband customers, driven by strong customer response to our un-carrier initiatives and promotions for services and devices;
•   increased customer adoption of upgrade and insurance programs; and
•   increased regulatory program revenues; partially offset by
•   lower branded postpaid phone arpu.
branded prepaid revenues increased $567 million or 8% primarily from:
•   growth in the number of average branded prepaid customers driven by the success of our metropcs brand promotional activities; and
•   continued growth in expansion markets.
wholesale revenues decreased $39 million or 5% primarily from:
•   revised agreements with certain mvno partners in 2015; partially offset by
•   growth in customers of certain mvno partners.
roaming and other service revenues decreased $73 million or 27% primarily from:

equipment revenues decreased $71 million or 1% primarily from:
•   lower average revenue per device sold, due in part to the impact of customers shifting to leasing higher-end devices under our jump! on demand program; partially offset by
•   growth in the number of devices and accessories sold.
with jump! on demand, revenues associated with leased wireless devices are recognized over the term of the lease rather than when the device is delivered to the customer. despite the increase in the number of devices leased in 2015 following the launch of jump! on demand, the unit volume of device sales increased 5% in 2015, compared to 2014.
we financed $5.2 billion of devices through eip during 2015, a decrease from $5.8 billion in 2014, primarily due to a decline in devices financed through eip as customers increasingly shifted to leasing devices with jump! on demand.
other revenues increased $114 million or 29% primarily attributable to higher non-service revenues from revenue share agreements with third parties.
operating expenses increased $1.8 billion or 7% primarily due to:
cost of services decreased $234 million or 4% primarily from:

the mvno transaction resulted in a transfer of 1,365,000 branded postpaid phone customers and 326,000 branded prepaid customers to wholesale customers on september 1, 2016. prospectively from september 1, 2016, net customer additions for these customers are included within wholesale customers. ending customers as of december 31, 2016 reflect the transfers in connection with the mvno transaction.
branded customers total branded net customer additions increased 780,000, or 13%, in 2016 primarily from:
•   higher branded prepaid net customer additions primarily due to the success of our metropcs brand, continued growth in new markets and distribution expansion, partially offset by an increase in the number of qualified branded prepaid customers migrating to branded postpaid plans; partially offset by
•   lower branded postpaid mobile broadband net customer additions primarily due to higher deactivations resulting from churn on a growing branded postpaid mobile broadband customer base, partially offset by higher gross customer additions; and
•   lower branded postpaid phone net customer additions primarily due to lower gross customer additions from higher deactivations on a growing customer base, partially offset by lower churn as well as an increase in the number of qualified branded prepaid customers migrating to branded postpaid plans as well as the optimization of our third-party distribution channels.
33
total branded net customer additions decreased 305,000, or 5%, in 2015 primarily from:
•   lower branded postpaid phone net customer additions primarily due to lower gross customer additions in 2015, compared to 2014, which included the introduction of un-carrier 4.0 contract freedom and certain attractive family rate plan promotions, partially offset by approximately 765,000 qualified branded prepaid customers upgrading to branded postpaid plans in 2015, compared to approximately 420,000 in 2014; partially offset by
•   higher branded postpaid mobile broadband net customer additions primarily due to higher gross customer additions driven by promotions for mobile broadband devices, partially offset by higher deactivations resulting from the discontinuation of certain promotional pricing for mobile broadband services and ongoing competitive activity in the marketplace; and
•   higher branded prepaid net customer additions primarily due to higher gross customer additions driven by the success of our metropcs brand promotional activities and continued growth in new markets, partially offset by approximately 765,000 qualified branded prepaid customers upgrading to branded postpaid plans in 2015, compared to approximately 420,000 in 2014.
wholesale wholesale net customer additions decreased 871,000, or 36%, in 2016 primarily due to higher mvno deactivations from certain mvno partners. going forward, we expect wholesale net customer additions to be significantly lower in 2017, as our mvno partners deemphasize lifeline in favor of higher arpu customer categories.
wholesale net customer additions increased 235,000, or 11%, in 2015 primarily due to higher mvno gross customer additions, partially offset by higher mvno deactivations.
customers per account customers per account is calculated by dividing the number of branded postpaid customers as of the end of the period by the number of branded postpaid accounts as of the end of the period. an account may include branded postpaid phone and mobile broadband customers. we believe branded postpaid customers per account provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to evaluate our branded postpaid customer base on a per account basis.

average revenue per user, average billings per user arpu represents the average monthly service revenue earned from customers. we believe arpu provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to assess and evaluate our service revenue realization per customer and assist in forecasting our future service revenues generated from our customer base. branded postpaid phone arpu excludes mobile broadband customers and related revenues.
average billings per user ("abpu") represents the average monthly customer billings, including monthly lease revenues and eip billings before securitization, per customer. we believe branded postpaid abpu provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to evaluate average branded postpaid customer billings as it is indicative of estimated cash collections, including device financing payments, from our customers each month.

•   the positive impact from our t-mobile one rate plans;
•   the transfer of customers as part of the mvno transaction as those customers had lower arpu;
•   continued growth of our insurance programs; and
•   higher regulatory program revenues.
we are making an accounting change in 2017 to include imputed interest associated with eip receivables in other revenues in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income, which will be excluded from branded postpaid phone arpu.
branded postpaid phone arpu decreased $1.76, or 4%, in 2015 primarily from:
•   dilution from the continued growth of customers on simple choice plans and promotions targeting families; partially offset by
•   an increase in regulatory program revenues.
branded postpaid abpu:
branded postpaid abpu decreased $0.02 in 2016 primarily from:
•   lower eip billings due to the impact of our jump! on demand program launched at the end of the second quarter of 2015;
•   lower branded postpaid phone arpu, as described above;
•   dilution from increased penetration of mobile broadband devices; partially offset by
•   an increase in lease revenues.
branded postpaid abpu increased $2.04, or 3%, in 2015 primarily from:
•   growth in devices financed by customers through the eip and jump! on demand programs; partially offset by
•   lower branded postpaid phone arpu, as described above.
branded prepaid arpu:
branded prepaid arpu increased $0.24, or 1%, in 2016 primarily from:
•   a decrease in certain customers that had lower average branded prepaid arpu, as well as higher data attach rates; partially offset by
•   dilution from growth of customers on rate plan promotions.
branded prepaid arpu increased $0.58, or 2%, in 2015 primarily from:
•   an increase in the mix of branded prepaid customers choosing plans with more data, which generate a higher arpu; partially offset by
•   dilution from growth of customers on rate plan promotions.
adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda represents earnings before interest expense, net of interest income, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation and certain expenses not reflective of t-mobile's operating performance.

net income margin represents net income divided by service revenues. adjusted ebitda margin represents adjusted ebitda divided by service revenues.
adjusted ebitda is a non-gaap financial measure utilized by our management to monitor the financial performance of our operations. we use adjusted ebitda internally as a metric to evaluate and compensate our personnel and management for their performance, and as a benchmark to evaluate our operating performance in comparison to our competitors. management believes analysts and investors use adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to evaluate overall operating performance and facilitate comparisons with other wireless communications companies because it is indicative of our ongoing operating performance and trends by excluding the impact of interest expense from financing, non-cash depreciation and amortization from capital investments, non-cash stock-based compensation, network decommissioning costs as they are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance and certain other nonrecurring expenses. adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income from operations, net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap.
the following table illustrates the calculation of adjusted ebitda and reconciles adjusted ebitda to net income, which we consider to be the most directly comparable gaap financial measure:

(1)   stock-based compensation includes payroll tax impacts and may not agree to stock-based compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements. gains on disposal of spectrum licenses may not agree to the consolidated statements of comprehensive income primarily due to certain routine operating activities, such as routine spectrum license exchanges that would be expected to reoccur, and are therefore included in adjusted ebitda. other, net may not agree to the consolidated statements of comprehensive income primarily due to certain non-routine operating activities, such as other special items that would not be expected to reoccur, and are therefore excluded in adjusted ebitda.
adjusted ebitda increased $3.0 billion, or 41%, in 2016 primarily from:
•   increased branded postpaid and prepaid service revenues primarily due to strong customer response to our un-carrier initiatives and the ongoing success of our promotional activities;
•   higher gains on disposal of spectrum licenses of $672 million; gains on disposal were $835 million in 2016 compared to $163 million in 2015;
•   lower losses on equipment in 2016 primarily due to an increase in lease revenues resulting from the launch of our jump! on demand program at the end of the second quarter of 2015. additionally, the costs of leased devices, which are capitalized and depreciated over the lease term, are excluded from adjusted ebitda. in connection with jump! on demand, we had lease revenues of $1.4 billion in 2016, and depreciation expense of $1.5 billion related to leased wireless devices in 2016; and
•   focused cost control and synergies realized from the metropcs business combination, primarily in cost of services; partially offset by
37
•   higher selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to strategic investments to support our growing customer base, including higher employee-related costs, higher commissions driven by an increase in branded customer additions and higher promotional costs.
we are making an accounting change in 2017 to include imputed interest associated with eip receivables in other revenues in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income, which will be included in adjusted ebitda. the impact from this accounting change is expected to be approximately $0.2 to $0.3 billion in 2017.
adjusted ebitda increased $1.8 billion, or 31%, in 2015 primarily from:
•   increased branded postpaid and prepaid revenues driven by strong customer response to our un-carrier initiatives and the ongoing success of our promotional activities;
•   focused cost control and synergies realized from the metropcs business combination, especially in cost of services;
•   lower losses on equipment in 2015 primarily due to an increase in lease revenues, which are recognized over the lease term, resulting from the launch of our jump! on demand at the end of the second quarter of 2015. additionally, the costs of leased devices, which are capitalized and depreciated over the lease term, are excluded from adjusted ebitda. in connection with jump! on demand, we had lease revenues of $224 million in 2015, and depreciation expense of $312 million related to leased wireless devices in 2015; partially offset by
•   higher selling, general and administrative expenses.
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations, proceeds from issuance of long-term debt, capital leases, common and preferred stock, the sale of certain receivables, financing arrangements of vendor payables which effectively extend payment terms and an unsecured revolving credit facility with deutsche telekom.

free cash flow increased $743 million in 2016 and increased $861 million for 2015 primarily from:
•   higher net cash provided by operating activities, as described above; and
•   lower purchases of property and equipment from the build-out of our 4g lte network in 2016, as described above. in 2015, purchases of property and equipment were higher compared to 2014 from the build-out of our 4g lte network, as described above. cash purchases of property and equipment includes capitalized interest of $142 million, $246 million and $64 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
debt as of december 31, 2016, our total debt was $27.8 billion, excluding our tower obligations, of which $27.4 billion was classified as long-term debt. significant debt-related activity during 2016 included:
•   in march 2016, t-mobile usa, a subsidiary of t-mobile us, inc., and certain of its affiliates, as guarantors, entered into a purchase agreement with deutsche telekom ag ("deutsche telekom"), our majority stockholder, under which t-mobile usa may, at its option, issue and sell to deutsche telekom $2.0 billion of 5.300% senior notes due 2021 (the "5.300% senior notes") for an aggregate purchase price of $2.0 billion. as amended in october 2016, if t-mobile usa does not elect to issue the 5.300% senior notes on or prior to may 5, 2017, the commitment under the purchase agreement terminates and t-mobile usa must reimburse deutsche telekom for the cost of its hedging arrangements (if any) related to the transaction. in addition, t-mobile usa is required to reimburse deutsche telekom for its cost of hedging arrangements related to the extension for the duration of the extended commitments.

•   the purchase price for the 6.000% senior notes that may be issued under the $1.35 billion purchase agreement will be approximately 103.316% of the outstanding principal balance of the notes issued. as amended in october 2016, if t-mobile usa does not elect to issue the 6.000% senior notes under the $1.35 billion purchase agreement on or prior to may 5, 2017 or elects to issue less than $1.35 billion of 6.000% senior notes, any unused portion of the commitment under the purchase agreement terminates and t-mobile usa must reimburse deutsche telekom for the cost of its hedging arrangements (if any) related to the transaction. in addition, t-mobile usa is required to reimburse deutsche telekom for its cost of hedging arrangements related to the extension for the duration of the extended commitments.
•   in april 2016, t-mobile usa entered into another purchase agreement with deutsche telekom, in which t-mobile usa may, at its option, issue and sell to deutsche telekom up to an additional $650 million of 6.000% senior notes due 2024. the purchase price for the 6.000% senior notes that may be issued under the $650 million purchase agreement will be approximately 104.047% of the outstanding principal balance of the notes issued. as amended in october 2016, if t-mobile usa does not elect to issue the 6.000% senior notes under the $650 million purchase agreement on or prior to may 5, 2017 or elects to issue less than $650 million senior notes, any unused portion of the commitment under the purchase agreement terminates and t-mobile usa must reimburse deutsche telekom for the cost of its hedging arrangements (if any) related to the transaction. in addition, t-mobile usa is required to reimburse deutsche telekom for its cost of hedging arrangements related to the extension for the duration of the extended commitments.
•   we have entered into uncommitted capital lease facilities with certain partners, which provide us with the ability to enter into capital leases for network equipment and services. as of december 31, 2016, we have committed to $1.3 billion of capital leases under these capital lease facilities, of which $799 million was executed during the year ended december 31, 2016. we expect to enter into up to an additional $900 million in capital lease commitments during 2017.
•   in december 2016, we terminated our $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility with deutsche telekom. in addition, t-mobile usa entered into a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility with deutsche telekom which comprised of (i) a three-year $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement and (ii) a three-year $1.5 billion senior
40
secured revolving credit agreement. as of december 31, 2016, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility.
•   in january 2017, t-mobile usa borrowed $4.0 billion under a secured term loan facility ("incremental term loan facility") with deutsche telekom to refinance $1.98 billion of outstanding secured term loans under its term loan credit agreement dated november 9, 2015, with the remaining net proceeds from the transaction intended to be used to redeem callable high yield debt. the loans under the incremental term loan facility were drawn in two tranches on january 31, 2017 (i) $2.0 billion of which will bear interest at a rate equal to a per annum rate of libor plus a margin of 2.00% and will mature on november 9, 2022 and (ii) $2.0 billion of which will bear interest at a rate equal to a per annum rate of libor plus a margin of 2.25% and will mature on january 31, 2024. the incremental term loan facility increases deutsche telekom's incremental term loan commitment provided to t-mobile usa under that certain first incremental facility amendment dated as of december 29, 2016 from $660 million to $2.0 billion and provides to t-mobile usa an additional $2.0 billion incremental term loan commitment. see note 14 - subsequent events of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
see note 7 - debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.
we could seek additional sources of liquidity, including through the issuance of additional long-term debt in 2017, to continue to opportunistically acquire spectrum licenses in private party transactions and future fcc spectrum license auctions or for the refinancing of existing long-term debt on an opportunistic basis. excluding liquidity that could be needed for spectrum acquisitions, we expect our principal sources of funding to be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity needs for business operations for the next 12 months. our intended use of any such funds is for general corporate purposes, including for capital expenditures and redemption of high yield callable debt.
we determine future liquidity requirements, for both operations and capital expenditures, based in large part upon projected financial and operating performance, and opportunities to acquire additional spectrum. we regularly review and update these projections for changes in current and projected financial and operating results, general economic conditions, the competitive landscape and other factors. there are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our financial and operating results and capital requirements to differ materially from our projections, which could cause future liquidity to differ materially from our assessment.
the indentures and credit facilities governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties, excluding capital leases, contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the issuer and the guarantor subsidiaries to: incur more debt; pay dividends and make distributions on our common stock; make certain investments; repurchase stock; create liens or other encumbrances; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter into transactions that restrict dividends or distributions from subsidiaries; and merge, consolidate, or sell, or otherwise dispose of, substantially all of their assets. certain provisions of each of the credit facilities, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties restrict the ability of the issuer to loan funds or make payments to the parent. however, the issuer is allowed to make certain permitted payments to the parent under the terms of each of the credit facilities, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties. we were in compliance with all restrictive debt covenants as of december 31, 2016.
capital expenditures our liquidity requirements have been driven primarily by capital expenditures for spectrum licenses and the construction, expansion and upgrading of our network infrastructure. property and equipment capital expenditures primarily relate to our network transformation, including the build out of 700 mhz a-block spectrum licenses. we expect cash capital expenditures for property and equipment to be in the range of $4.8 billion to $5.1 billion in 2017, excluding capitalized interest. this does not include property and equipment obtained through capital lease agreements, leased wireless devices transferred from inventory or purchases of spectrum licenses. similar to 2016, cash capital expenditures will be front-end loaded in 2017 due to the completion of the 700 mhz a-block build-out.
in particular, we are participating in the fcc broadcast incentive auction of low-band 600 mhz spectrum licenses that is currently in-progress. if we win spectrum in the auction, we may incur substantial additional expenditures for the purchase price and to gain access to such spectrum. any such amounts would be funded primarily through cash on hand and borrowings. as a result, our level of debt could increase.
41
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and borrowings as of december 31, 2016 and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods:
(in millions)                                        less than 1 year           1 - 3 years           4 - 5 years           more than 5 years               total long-term debt (1)                                        $20                  $3,040                $7,790                   $15,330                 $26,180

(1)   represents principal amounts of long-term debt to affiliates and third parties at maturity, excluding unamortized premium from purchase price allocation fair value adjustment, capital lease obligations and vendor financing arrangements. see note 7 - debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
(2)   future minimum payments, including principal and interest payments and imputed lease rental income, related to the tower obligations. see note 8 - tower obligations of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
(3)   as of december 31, 2016, we have updated the future minimum lease payments for all cell site leases presented above to include only payments due for the initial non-cancelable lease term only as they represent the payments which we cannot avoid at our option and also corresponds to our lease term assessment for new leases. this update had the effect of reducing our operating lease commitments included in the table above by $4.6 billion as of december 31, 2016. see note 12 - commitments and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
(4)   t-mobile calculated the minimum obligation for certain agreements to purchase goods or services based on termination fees that can be paid to exit the contract. termination penalties are included in the above table as payments due in less than one year, as this is the earliest t-mobile could exit these contracts. for certain contracts that include fixed volume purchase commitments and fixed prices for various products, the purchase obligations are calculated using fixed volumes and contractually fixed prices for the products that are expected to be purchased. this table does not include open purchase orders as of december 31, 2016 under normal business purposes. see note 12 - commitments and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
(5)   represents future undiscounted cash flows related to decommissioned metropcs cdma network and certain other redundant cell sites as of december 31, 2016.
certain commitments and obligations are included in the table based on the year of required payment or an estimate of the year of payment. other long-term liabilities, excluding network decommissioning, have been omitted from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments, combined with the absence of historical trending to be used as a predictor of such payments. in addition, because dividends on preferred stock are subject to approval by our board of directors, amounts are not included in the preceding table unless such authorization has occurred and the dividend has not been paid. see note 13 - additional financial information of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
the purchase obligations reflected in the table above are primarily commitments to purchase handsets and accessories, equipment, software, programming and network services, and marketing activities, which will be used or sold in the ordinary course of business. these amounts do not represent t-mobile's entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which t-mobile is contractually committed. where t-mobile is committed to make a minimum payment to the supplier regardless of whether it takes delivery, t-mobile has included only that minimum payment as a purchase obligation. additionally, included within purchase obligations are amounts for the acquisition of spectrum licenses, which are subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions.
off-balance sheet arrangements in 2015, we entered into an arrangement, as amended, to sell certain eip accounts receivable on a revolving basis through november 2017 as an additional source of liquidity. in june 2016, the arrangement was amended to increase the maximum funding commitment to $1.3 billion with a scheduled expiration date in november 2017. in 2014, we entered into an arrangement, as amended, to sell certain service accounts receivable on a revolving basis through march 2017 as an additional source of liquidity. in november 2016, the arrangement was amended to increase the maximum funding commitment to $950 million with a scheduled expiration date in march 2018. as of december 31, 2016, t-mobile derecognized net receivables of $2.5 billion upon sale through these arrangements.  see note 3 - sales of certain receivables of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
42
related-party transactions in march 2016, t-mobile usa entered into a purchase agreement with deutsche telekom under which t-mobile usa may, at its option, issue and sell to deutsche telekom $2.0 billion of 5.300% senior notes due 2021 for an aggregate purchase price of $2.0 billion.
in april 2016, t-mobile usa entered into a purchase agreement with deutsche telekom under which t-mobile usa may, at its option, issue and sell to deutsche telekom up to $1.35 billion of 6.000% senior notes due 2024. the purchase price for the 6.000% senior notes that may be issued under the $1.35 billion purchase agreement will be approximately 103.316% of the outstanding principal balance of the notes issued.
in april 2016, t-mobile usa entered into a purchase agreement with deutsche telekom under which t-mobile usa may, at its option, issue and sell to deutsche telekom up to $650 million of 6.000% senior notes due 2024. the purchase price for the 6.000% senior notes that may be issued under the $650 million purchase agreement will be approximately 104.047% of the outstanding principal balance of the notes issued.
the purchase agreements were amended in october 2016, see note 7 - debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
in december 2016, we terminated our $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility with deutsche telekom. in addition, t-mobile usa entered into a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility with deutsche telekom which comprised of (i) a three-year $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement and (ii) a three-year $1.5 billion senior secured revolving credit agreement. as of december 31, 2016, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility.
in january 2017, t-mobile usa borrowed $4.0 billion under a secured term loan facility ("incremental term loan facility") with deutsche telekom to refinance $1.98 billion of outstanding secured term loans under its term loan credit agreement dated november 9, 2015, with the remaining net proceeds from the transaction intended to be used to redeem callable high yield debt. the loans under the incremental term loan facility were drawn in two tranches on january 31, 2017 (i) $2.0 billion of which will bear interest at a rate equal to a per annum rate of libor plus a margin of 2.00% and will mature on november 9, 2022 and (ii) $2.0 billion of which will bear interest at a rate equal to a per annum rate of libor plus a margin of 2.25% and will mature on january 31, 2024. the incremental term loan facility increases deutsche telekom's incremental term loan commitment provided to t-mobile usa under that certain first incremental facility amendment dated as of december 29, 2016 from $660 million to $2.0 billion and provides to t-mobile usa an additional $2.0 billion incremental term loan commitment. see note 14 - subsequent events of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
we also have related party transactions associated with deutsche telekom or its affiliates in the ordinary course of business, including intercompany servicing and licensing. see note 13 - additional financial information of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
disclosure of iranian activities under section 13(r) of the securities exchange act of 1934
section 219 of the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 added section 13(r) to the exchange act of 1934, as amended ("exchange act").  section 13(r) requires an issuer to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to iran or with designated natural persons or entities involved in terrorism or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  disclosure is required even where the activities, transactions or dealings are conducted outside the u.s. by non-u.s. affiliates in compliance with applicable law, and whether or not the activities are sanctionable under u.s. law.
as of the date of this report, we are not aware of any activity, transaction or dealing by us or any of our affiliates in 2016 that requires disclosure in this report under section 13(r) of the exchange act, except as set forth below with respect to affiliates that we do not control and that are our affiliates solely due to their common control with deutsche telekom. we have relied upon deutsche telekom for information regarding their activities, transactions and dealings.
deutsche telekom, through certain of its non-u.s. subsidiaries, is party to roaming and interconnect agreements with the following mobile and fixed line telecommunication providers in iran, some of which are or may be government-controlled entities: gostaresh ertebatat taliya, irancell telecommunications services company ("mtn irancell"), telecommunication kish company, mobile telecommunication company of iran, and telecommunication infrastructure company of iran. in
43
2016, gross revenues of all deutsche telekom affiliates generated by roaming and interconnection traffic with iran were less than $1.0 million and estimated net profits were less than $1.0 million.
in addition, deutsche telekom, through certain of its non-u.s. subsidiaries, operating a fixed line network in their respective european home countries (in particular germany), provides telecommunications services in the ordinary course of business to the embassy of iran in those european countries. gross revenues and net profits recorded from these activities in 2016 were less than $0.1 million. we understand that deutsche telekom intends to continue these activities.
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our financial condition and results as they require the use of estimates and assumptions which affect the financial statements and accompanying notes. see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for further information.
these policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. these estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates.
allowances we maintain an allowance for estimated losses inherent in the accounts receivable and eip receivable portfolios. when determining the allowance, we consider a number of factors, including historical experience and current collection trends, aging of the receivable portfolio, credit quality of the customer base and other qualitative factors such as macro-economic conditions.
credit collection risks are assessed for each type of receivable, such as eip receivables, based upon historical and expected write-offs, net of recoveries, and an analysis of the aged receivable balances with reserves generally increasing as the receivable ages. to the extent that actual loss experience differs significantly from historical trends or assumptions, the required allowance amounts could differ from the estimate. we write off account balances if collection efforts are unsuccessful and the receivable balance is deemed uncollectible, based on customer credit ratings and the length of time from the original billing date.
we offer certain retail customers the option to pay for their devices and other purchases in installments over a period of up to 24 months using an eip. at the time of an installment sale, we impute a discount for interest as there is no stated rate of interest on the eip receivables and record the eip receivables at their present value, which is determined by discounting future payments at the imputed interest rate. the difference between the present value of the eip receivables and their face amount results in a discount which is recorded as a direct reduction to the carrying value with a corresponding reduction to equipment revenues. we determine the imputed discount rate based primarily on current market interest rates and the amount of expected credit losses on the eip receivables. as a result, we do not recognize a separate valuation allowance at the time of issuance as the effects of uncertainty about future cash flows are included in the initial present value measurement of the receivable. the imputed discount on eip receivables is amortized over the financed installment term using the effective interest method and recognized as interest income in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
subsequent to the initial determination of the imputed discount, we assess the need for and, if necessary, recognize an allowance for credit losses to the extent the amount of estimated probable losses on the gross eip receivables exceed the remaining unamortized imputed discount balances.
total imputed discount and allowances as of december 31, 2016 and 2015 was approximately 8.0% and 8.2%, respectively, of the total amount of gross accounts receivable, including eip receivables.
depreciation depreciation commences once assets have been placed in service. we generally depreciate property and equipment over the period the property and equipment provide economic benefit. leased wireless devices are depreciated to their estimated residual value over the period expected to provide utility to t-mobile, which is generally the lease term. depreciable life studies are performed periodically to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable lives for certain categories of property, plant and equipment. these studies take into account actual usage, physical wear and tear, replacement history, assumptions about technology evolution and expected loss of leased wireless devices. when these factors indicate that an asset's useful life is different from the previous assessment, the remaining book values are depreciated prospectively over the adjusted remaining
44
estimated useful life. see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies and note 4 - property and equipment of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for information regarding depreciation of assets, including management's underlying estimates of useful lives.
evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment we assess the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our spectrum licenses, for potential impairment annually as of december 31 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired.
we may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not the fair value of the single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. if we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not the fair value of the single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is tested for impairment based on a two-step test. in the first step, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. the fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a market approach, which is based on market capitalization. we recognize market capitalization is subject to volatility and will monitor changes in market capitalization to determine whether declines, if any, necessitate an interim impairment review. in the event market capitalization does decline below its book value, we will consider the length, severity and reasons for the decline when assessing whether potential impairment exists, including considering whether a control premium should be added to the market capitalization. we believe short-term fluctuations in share price may not necessarily reflect the underlying aggregate fair value.
in the second step, we determine the fair values of all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including those that currently may not be recorded. the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the sum of the fair value of all of those assets and liabilities represents the implied goodwill amount. if the implied fair value of goodwill is lower than the carrying amount of goodwill, then an impairment loss is recognized for the difference.
we test spectrum licenses for impairment on an aggregate basis, consistent with the management of the overall business at a national level. we may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible asset group is less than its carrying value. if we do not perform the qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not the fair value of the intangible asset group is less than its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset group. if the carrying amount of spectrum licenses exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized.  we estimate the fair value of the spectrum licenses using the greenfield approach, which is an income approach that estimates the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. the greenfield approach values the spectrum licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except the asset to be valued (in this case, spectrum licenses). the value of the spectrum licenses can be considered as equal to the present value of the cash flows of this hypothetical start-up company. we base the assumptions underlying the greenfield approach on a combination of market participant data and our historical results, trends and business plans. future cash flows in the greenfield approach are based on estimates and assumptions of market participant revenues, ebitda margin, network build-out period and a long-term growth rate for a market participant. the cash flows are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital.
the valuation approaches utilized to estimate fair value for the purposes of the impairment tests of goodwill and spectrum licenses require the use of assumptions and estimates, which involve a degree of uncertainty. if actual results or future expectations are not consistent with the assumptions, this may result in the recording of significant impairment charges on goodwill or spectrum licenses. the most significant assumptions within the valuation models are the discount rate, revenues, ebitda margins and the long-term growth rate. see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies and note 5 - goodwill, spectrum licenses and other intangible assets of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k for information regarding our annual impairment test and impairment charges.
guarantee liabilities in 2013, we introduced a device trade-in program, just upgrade my phone ("jump!"), which provides eligible customers a specified-price trade-in right to upgrade their device. participating customers must finance the purchase of a device on an eip and have a qualifying t-mobile monthly wireless service plan, which is treated as a single multiple-element arrangement when entered into at or near the same time. upon qualifying jump! program upgrades, the customers' remaining eip balance is settled provided they trade-in their eligible used device in good working condition and purchase a new device from us on a new eip.
45
for customers who enroll in jump!, we defer and recognize a liability, for the portion of revenue which represents the estimated fair value of the specified-price trade-in right guarantee. the guarantee liability is valued based on various economic and customer behavioral assumptions, which requires judgment, including estimating the customer's remaining eip balance at trade-in, the expected fair value of the used device at trade-in, and the probability and timing of trade-in. when customers upgrade their device, the difference between the eip balance credit to the customer and the fair value of the returned device is recorded against the guarantee liabilities. all assumptions are reviewed periodically.
rent expense most of the leases on our tower sites have fixed rent escalations which provide for periodic increases in the amount of rent payable over time. we calculate straight-line rent expense for each of these leases based on the fixed non-cancellable term of the lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes a penalty on us in such amount that a renewal appears, at lease inception or significant modification, to be reasonably assured. we consider several factors in assessing whether renewal periods are reasonably assured of being exercised, including the continued maturation of our network nationwide, technological advances within the telecommunications industry and the availability of alternative sites. we make significant assumptions at lease inception in determining and assessing the factors that constitute a "penalty." in doing so, we primarily consider costs incurred in acquiring and developing new sites, the useful life of site improvements and equipment costs, future economic conditions and the extent to which improvements in wireless technologies can be incorporated into a current assessment of whether an economic compulsion will exist in the future to renew a lease.
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these differences are realized. a valuation allowance is maintained against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. the ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions within the carryforward periods available. we consider many factors when determining whether a valuation allowance is needed, including recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future income, the carryforward periods available for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors.
we account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with the accounting guidance on the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. we assess whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position and adjust the unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law.

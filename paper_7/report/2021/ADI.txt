item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts)
the following discussion includes a comparison of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources for the fiscal years ended october 30, 2021 (fiscal 2021), the fiscal year ended october 31, 2020 (fiscal 2020) and the fiscal year ended november 2, 2019 (fiscal 2019). our fiscal year is the 52-week or 53-week period ending on the saturday closest to the last day in october. fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 were 52-week fiscal periods.
impact of covid-19 on our business the pandemic caused by the novel strain of the coronavirus (covid-19) and the numerous measures implemented by government authorities in response, have impacted and likely will continue to impact our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers and those of our respective vendors and suppliers. we have significant operations worldwide, including in the united states, the philippines, ireland, malaysia, thailand, china and india. each of these countries has been affected by the pandemic and taken measures to try to contain it, resulting in disruptions at some of our manufacturing operations and facilities.
the spread of covid-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including restricting employee travel, modifying employee work locations and cancelling physical participation in meetings, events and conferences) and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers and shareholders.
while we are confident that our strategy and long-term contingency planning have positioned us well to weather the current uncertainty, we cannot at this time fully quantify or forecast the impact of covid-19 on our business. the full extent of the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain such as the continued duration and severity of the pandemic, the spread of more contagious variants of the virus, the adoption rate of vaccines, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, or how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.

revenue trends by end market the following table summarizes revenue by end market. the categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the "sold to" customer information, the "ship to" customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated. as data systems for capturing and tracking this data and our methodology evolves and improves, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. when this occurs, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within each end market.

revenue increased across all end markets in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily as a result of higher broad-based demand for our products sold into the automotive, consumer and industrial end markets. revenue in the communications end market was also slightly higher in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 as the timing of infrastructure deployment cycles in certain regions offset higher demand. incremental revenue as a result of the acquisition also contributed to higher revenue in each end market in fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020.
revenue by sales channel the following table summarizes revenue by sales channel. we sell our products globally through a direct sales force, third party distributors, independent sales representatives and via our website. distributors are customers that buy products with the intention of reselling them. direct customers are non-distributor customers and consist primarily of original equipment manufacturers (oems). other customers include the u.s. government, government prime contractors and certain commercial customers for which revenue is recorded over time.

in all periods presented, the predominant countries comprising "rest of north and south america" are canada and mexico; the predominant countries comprising "europe" are germany, sweden, and the netherlands; and the predominant countries comprising "rest of asia" are taiwan, malaysia, south korea and singapore.
total revenue increased in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 due to broad-based, global demand in the semiconductor industry as well as the incremental impact of revenue from the acquisition. we saw increases across all end markets in territories, with the exception of sales into the communication end market in china, which was impacted by infrastructure deployment cycles as noted above.

gross margin percentage in fiscal 2021 decreased by 410 basis points compared to fiscal 2020, primarily as a result of recording additional costs related to the acquisition, including $331.1 million and $155.4 million of cost of goods sold related to the fair value adjustments recorded to inventory and amortization expense of intangible assets, respectively. these increases in cost of sales as a result of the acquisition were partially offset by the favorable impact of higher utilization of our factories due to increased customer demand.

r&d expenses increased in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily as a result of higher r&d employee-related variable compensation expense, incremental r&d expenses incurred as a result of the acquisition and higher salary and benefit expenses.
r&d expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from year-to-year depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts, which we view as critical to our future growth. we expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products. we believe that a continued commitment to r&d is essential to maintain product leadership with our existing products as well as to provide innovative new product offerings. therefore, we expect to continue to make significant r&d investments in the future.

the year-over-year increase in nonoperating expense in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily the result of a loss on the extinguishment of debt related to debt transactions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, partially offset by gains recorded on other investments and a decrease in interest expense related to our debt obligations in the period.

our effective tax rates for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 were below the u.s. statutory rate of 21% due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income. our provision for income taxes was impacted by incremental profit related to the acquisition. additionally, in fiscal 2021, we recorded a net deferred tax benefit of $188.8 million from deferred tax assets related to an intra-entity transfer of intangible assets. for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, our pretax income was primarily generated in ireland at a tax rate of 12.5%.
our tax rate for fiscal 2020 was also impacted by discrete items, primarily related to $25.9 million of income tax benefits resulting from the resolution of the internal revenue service audit of linear's pre-acquisition federal income tax returns for fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2017, as well as other income tax benefits recorded upon the filing of our fiscal 2019 federal income tax return and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation payments of $16.2 million.

liquidity and capital resources at october 30, 2021, our principal source of liquidity was $1,978.0 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $876.6 million was held in the united states and the balance of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries. we manage our worldwide cash requirements by, among other things, reviewing available funds held by our foreign subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness by which those funds can be accessed in the united states. we do not expect current regulatory restrictions or taxes on repatriation to have a material adverse effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, including money market funds. we maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties, continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk.
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available short- and long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and dividend payments (if any) in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months.

a discussion of changes in our liquidity and capital resources from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020 has been omitted from this form 10-k, but may be found in "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of our form 10-k for fiscal 2020 filed with the securities and exchange commission on november 24, 2020. the following changes contributed to the net change in cash and cash equivalents from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021.
operating activities cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. the increase in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily a result of higher net income and an increase from changes in working capital. net income in fiscal 2021 also included larger non-cash expenses from the acquisition that were not included in fiscal 2020.
investing activities investing cash flows generally consist of capital expenditures, cash used for acquisitions and proceeds from or purchases of investments. the increase in cash provided by (used for) investing activities during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily the result of cash received from the acquisition, partially offset by an increase in cash used for capital expenditures.
financing activities financing cash flows consist primarily of payments of dividends to stockholders, repurchases of common stock, issuance and repayment of debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to employee equity incentive plans. the increase in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily the result of an increase in common stock repurchases in connection with our accelerated share repurchase program and higher dividend payments, partially offset by a net increase in debt in fiscal 2021 as we terminated some debt and raised additional proceeds from debt compared to the net decrease in debt in 2020.

(1)we use the average of the current year and prior year ending net accounts receivable and ending inventory balance in our calculation of days sales outstanding and days cost of sales in inventory, respectively. cost of sales amounts used in the calculation of days cost of sales in inventory for fiscal 2021 include acquisition accounting adjustments related to the sale of acquired inventory written up to fair value, amortization of developed technology intangible assets acquired and depreciation related to the write-up of fixed assets to fair value. the calculations above include the financial results of maxim prospectively from the acquisition date.
the increase in accounts receivable for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily the result of the acquisition as well as normal variations in the timing of collections and billings.
inventory in dollars increased in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020, primarily as a result of the acquisition as well as our efforts to balance manufacturing production, demand and inventory levels. our inventory levels are impacted by our need to support forecasted sales demand and variations between those forecasts and actual demand. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, the inventory values on the consolidated balance sheet were also impacted by additional costs related to the acquisition and the requirement to account for acquired inventory at fair-value.
current liabilities increased to $2,770.3 million at october 30, 2021 from $1,365.0 million recorded at the end of fiscal 2020. the increase was primarily due to the acquisition, including $516.7 million of maxim debt obligations classified as current and $584.9 million of accrued liabilities.
revolving credit facility our third amended and restated revolving credit agreement, dated as of june 23, 2021, with bank of america n.a. as administrative agent and the other banks identified therein as lenders (revolving credit agreement) amended and restated our second amended and restated credit agreement dated as of june 28, 2019 and provides for a five year unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $2.5 billion (subject to certain terms and conditions). in march 2020, we borrowed $350.0 million under this revolving credit facility and utilized the proceeds for the repayment of existing indebtedness and working capital requirements. we repaid the $350.0 million plus interest in april 2020. in september 2021, we borrowed $400.0 million under this revolving credit facility and utilized the proceeds for the repayment of existing indebtedness and working capital requirements. we repaid the $400.0 million plus interest in october 2021.
we may borrow under this revolving credit facility in the future and use the proceeds for repayment of existing indebtedness, stock repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other lawful corporate purposes. the terms of the revolving credit agreement impose restrictions on our ability to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. in addition, the revolving credit agreement contains a consolidated leverage ratio covenant of total consolidated funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (ebitda) of not greater than 3.5 to 1.0. as of october 30, 2021, we were in compliance with these covenants. see note 13, revolving credit facility, of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information on our revolving credit facility.
debt as of october 30, 2021, we had $6.8 billion of carrying value outstanding on our debt. on november 4, 2021, we redeemed maxim's 3.375% senior notes due 2023 in the aggregate principal amount of $500.0 million. the difference in the carrying value of the debt and the principal is due to the unamortized discount and issuance fees and other adjustments on these instruments. the indentures governing certain of our debt instruments contain covenants that may limit our ability to: incur, create, assume or guarantee any debt or borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property; enter into sale and lease-back transactions with respect to a principal property; and consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to, any other party. as of october 30, 2021, we were compliant with these covenants. see note 14, debt, and note 15, subsequent events, of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information on our outstanding debt.
stock repurchase program in september 2021, we entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements (asr) with third party financial institutions to repurchase $2.5 billion of our common stock. we paid $2.5 billion and received an initial delivery of 12.3 million shares of common stock, which represented approximately 80% of the notional amount of the asr. the final settlement of the transaction under the asr is expected to occur in the first half of fiscal 2022.
our common stock repurchase program has been in place since august 2004. since inception, our board of directors has authorized us to repurchase $16.7 billion of our common stock under the program, which includes the $8.5 billion authorization approved by the board of directors on august 25, 2021. under the program, we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions. unless terminated earlier by resolution of our board of directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program.
as of october 30, 2021, $7.4 billion remained available for repurchase under the current authorized program. the repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock. we also repurchase shares in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock units/awards or the exercise of stock options. future repurchases of common stock will be dependent upon our financial position, results of operations, outlook, liquidity, and other factors we deem relevant.
capital expenditures net additions to property, plant and equipment were $343.7 million in fiscal 2021 and were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations. we expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2022 to be between 6% and 8% of revenue, which is above our historical levels primarily due to our plans to expand internal manufacturing capacity. these capital expenditures will be funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available short- and long-term financing.
analog devices foundation during the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we contributed 335,654 shares of our common stock to the analog devices foundation. as of the date of the contribution, the shares had a fair value of approximately $40.0 million. this expense was recorded in smg&a in the consolidated statement of income.
dividends on november 22, 2021, our board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.69 per outstanding share of common stock. the dividend will be paid on december 14, 2021 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on december 3, 2021 and is expected to total approximately $362.5 million. we currently expect quarterly dividends to continue in future periods, although they remain subject to determination and declaration by our board of directors. the payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors, including our financial performance, outlook and liquidity.

_______________________________________
(1)debt obligations are assumed to be held to maturity.
(2)tax obligation relates to the one-time tax on deemed repatriated earnings under the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 enacted in fiscal 2018. see note 12, income taxes, of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further discussion. this amount includes transition tax payable attributable to the acquisition of $266.1 million.
(3)certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses. these escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table.
(4)in connection with the acquisition, we acquired a supplier commitment for the purchase of materials and supplies in advance or with minimum purchase quantities.
as of october 30, 2021, our total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions was $170.5 million, which are included in non-current income taxes payable in our consolidated balance sheets contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. due to the complexity associated with our tax uncertainties, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the non-current liabilities associated with these uncertain tax positions. therefore, we have not included these uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table.
the expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information available as of october 30, 2021.
new accounting pronouncements from time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board (fasb) and are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. unless otherwise discussed, management believes that the impact of recently issued standards will not have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations. see note 2s, new accounting pronouncements, of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements, including the dates of adoption and impact on our historical financial condition and results of operations.
critical accounting policies and estimates management's discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information. we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. if actual results differ significantly from management's estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements. we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies; however, the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective.
revenue recognition recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the providing entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. we recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: (1) we have entered into a binding agreement, (2) the performance obligations have been identified, (3) the transaction price to the customer has been determined, (4) the transaction price has been allocated to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) the performance obligations have been satisfied. the majority of our shipping terms permit us to recognize revenue at point of shipment or delivery. certain shipping terms require the goods to be through customs or be received by the customer before title passes. in those instances, we defer the revenue recognized until title has passed. shipping costs are charged to selling, marketing, general and administrative expense as incurred. sales taxes are excluded from revenue.
revenue from contracts with the united states government, government prime contractors and certain commercial customers is recorded over time using either units delivered or costs incurred as the measurement basis for progress toward completion. these measures are used to measure results directly and is generally the best measure of progress toward completion in circumstances in which a reliable measure of output can be established. estimated revenue in excess of amounts billed is reported as unbilled receivables. contract accounting requires judgment in estimating costs and assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedule. contract costs include material, subcontract costs, labor and an allocation of indirect costs. the estimation of costs at completion of a contract is subject to numerous variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract. changes in contract performance, estimated gross margin, including the impact of final contract settlements, and estimated losses are recognized in the period in which the changes or losses are determined.
performance obligations: substantially all of our contracts with customers contain a single performance obligation, the sale of mixed-signal integrated circuit (ic) products. such sales represent a single performance obligation because the sale is one type of good or includes multiple goods that are neither capable of being distinct nor separable from the other promises in the contract. this performance obligation is satisfied when control of the product is transferred to the customer, which occurs upon shipment or delivery. unsatisfied performance obligations primarily represent contracts for products with future delivery dates and with an original expected duration of one year or less. we generally warrant that our products will meet their published specifications, and that we will repair or replace defective products, for one year from the date title passes from us to the customer. specific accruals are recorded for known product warranty issues.
transaction price: the transaction price reflects our expectations about the consideration we will be entitled to receive from the customer and may include fixed or variable amounts. fixed consideration primarily includes sales to direct customers and sales to distributors in which both the sale to the distributor and the sale to the end customer occur within the same reporting period. variable consideration includes sales in which the amount of consideration that we will receive is unknown as of the end of a reporting period. such consideration primarily includes credits issued to the distributor due to price protection and sales made to distributors under agreements that allow certain rights of return, referred to as stock rotation. price protection represents price discounts granted to certain distributors to allow the distributor to earn an appropriate margin on sales negotiated with certain customers and in the event of a price decrease subsequent to the date the product was shipped and billed to the distributor. stock rotation allows distributors limited levels of returns in order to reduce the amounts of slow-moving, discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory. a liability for distributor credits covering variable consideration is made based on management's estimate of historical experience rates as well as considering economic conditions and contractual terms. to date, actual distributor claims activity has been materially consistent with the provisions we have made based on our historical estimates.
contract balances: accounts receivable represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from our customers. payments are typically due within 30 to 45 days of invoicing and do not include a significant financing component. to date, there have been no material impairment losses on accounts receivable. there were no material contract assets or contract liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets in any of the periods presented.
inventory valuation we value inventories at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write down inventories to net realizable value. we employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory. while a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory. if actual demand for our products is less than our estimates, additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods. to date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future.
long-lived assets we review property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. recoverability of these assets is determined by comparison of their carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining estimated lives. if such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property, plant, and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods. evaluation of impairment of long-lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long-lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. these differences could result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in addition, in certain instances, assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased. in these situations, we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives.
goodwill goodwill is subject to impairment tests annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable, utilizing either the qualitative or quantitative method. we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which we determined is consistent with our identified operating segments, on an annual basis on the first day of the fourth quarter (on or about august 1) or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist or we reorganize our operating segments or reporting units.
we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its net book value. when using the qualitative method, we consider several factors, including the following:
-the amount by which the fair values of each reporting unit exceeded their carrying values as of the date of the most recent quantitative impairment analysis, which indicated there would need to be substantial negative developments in the markets in which these reporting units operate in order for there to be potential impairment;
-the carrying values of these reporting units as of the assessment date compared to their previously calculated fair values as of the date of the most recent quantitative impairment analysis;
-the current forecasts as compared to the forecasts included in the most recent quantitative impairment analysis;
-public information from competitors and other industry information to determine if there were any significant adverse trends in our competitors' businesses;
-changes in the value of major u.s. stock indices that could suggest declines in overall market stability that could impact the valuation of our reporting units;
-changes in our market capitalization and overall enterprise valuation to determine if there were any significant decreases that could be an indication that the valuation of our reporting units had significantly decreased; and
-whether there had been any significant increases to the weighted-average cost of capital rates for each reporting unit, which could materially lower our prior valuation conclusions under a discounted cash flow approach.
if we elect not to use this option, or we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its net book value, then we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. the quantitative goodwill impairment test requires an entity to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. if fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount of the carrying value that exceeds the amount of the reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. additionally, we consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. we determine the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of the income and market approaches. under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow methodology which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted revenues, gross profit margins, operating income margins, working capital cash flow, perpetual growth rates, and long-term discount rates, among others. for the market approach, we use the guideline public company method. under this method we utilize information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units, to create valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested, in order to obtain their respective fair values. in order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated reporting unit fair values, we reconcile the aggregate fair values of our reporting units determined, as described above, to our total company market capitalization, allowing for a reasonable control premium.
during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, we elected to use the quantitative method of assessing goodwill for all of our reporting units. in all periods presented, we concluded the reporting units' fair values exceeded their carrying amounts as of the assessment dates and no risk of impairment existed.
business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting, we recognize tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. we record the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the value of the net assets acquired as goodwill. the accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets and the fair value of contingent payment obligations. critical estimates in valuing purchased technology, customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could experience impairment charges which could be material. in addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. if our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed.
we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. we generally determine the fair value of the contingent consideration using the income approach methodology of valuation. each reporting period thereafter, we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating expenses within the consolidated statements of income. changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration can result from changes in assumed discount periods and rates, and from changes pertaining to the achievement of the defined milestones. significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. accordingly, future business and economic conditions, as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above, can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period.
accounting for income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of certain expenses for tax and financial statement purposes. we assess the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and record a corresponding valuation allowance as necessary if we determine those deferred tax assets may not be realized due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount to be realized of certain state and international tax credit carryovers. in reaching our conclusion, we evaluate certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to realize deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state and international jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years. our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in u.s. or international tax laws and other factors. these changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, which may result in an increase or decrease to our income tax provision in future periods.
we account for uncertain tax positions by first determining if it is "more likely than not" that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities prior to recording any benefit in the financial statements. an uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. we classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within the (benefit from) provision for income taxes line of the consolidated statements of income. we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. this evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in known facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new guidance on legislative interpretations. a change in these factors could result in the recognition of an increase or decrease to our income tax provision, which could materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
in the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities. although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and income tax liabilities. in the event our assumptions are incorrect, the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. in addition to the factors described above, our current and expected effective tax rate is based on then-current tax law. significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates.
see note 12, income taxes, of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further discussion.
stock-based compensation stock-based compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the consolidated statements of income. determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant-date fair value of stock options and market-based restricted stock units. we calculate the grant-date fair values of stock options using the black-scholes valuation model. the grant-date fair value of restricted stock units with a service condition and restricted stock units with both service and performance conditions are calculated using the value of our common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on our common stock prior to vesting. for restricted stock units with both service and performance conditions, this grant-date fair value is also impacted by the number of units that are expected to vest during the performance period and is adjusted through the related stock-based compensation expense at each reporting period based on the probability of achievement of that performance condition. if we determine that an award is unlikely to vest, any previously recorded stock-based compensation expense is reversed in the period of that determination. the grant date fair value of restricted stock units or performance-based stock options with both service and market conditions are calculated using the monte carlo simulation model to estimate the probability of satisfying the performance condition stipulated in the award grant, including the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied.
the use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of key assumptions such as expected option term and stock price volatility to determine the fair value of a stock option. the estimate of these key assumptions is based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends. we recognize the expense related to equity awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. see note 2r, stock-based compensation, and note 3, stock-based compensation and shareholders' equity, of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for more information related to stock-based compensation.
contingencies from time to time, in the ordinary course of business, various claims, charges and litigation are asserted or commenced against us arising from, or related to, among other things, contractual matters, patents, trademarks, personal injury, environmental matters, product liability, insurance coverage, employment or employment benefits. we periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded. in making this determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. based on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. if a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, we record a contingent loss. in determining the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. if the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations.
item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure our interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. in this regard, changes in interest rates affect the interest earned or paid on our marketable securities and debt, as well as the fair value of our investments and debt.
based on the $500.0 million of our floating rate debt outstanding as of october 30, 2021, our annual interest expense would change by approximately $5.0 million for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates.
in certain instances, we utilize interest rate derivatives to manage interest rate exposure on both outstanding debt as well as future issuances. as of october 30, 2021, we had no outstanding interest rate derivative instruments. as of october 31, 2020, for each 100 basis point decrease in the ten-year u.s. treasury rate, the fair value of our outstanding derivative instruments would have changed by approximately $102.0 million.
based on our marketable securities outstanding as of october 30, 2021 and october 31, 2020, our annual interest income would change by approximately $19.7 million and $10.6 million, respectively, for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates.
to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. based on investment positions as of october 30, 2021 and october 31, 2020, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would not materially impact the fair market value of the portfolio in either period. if significant, such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity.
as of october 30, 2021, we had $6.8 billion in principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding, with a fair value of $7.1 billion. the fair value of our notes is subject to interest rate risk, market risk, and other factors. generally, the fair value of our notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. the fair values of our notes as of october 30, 2021 and october 31, 2020, assuming a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates, are as follows:
october 30, 2021   october 31, 2020

foreign currency exposure as more fully described in note 2i, derivative and hedging agreements, of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k, we regularly hedge our non-u.s. dollar-based exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts. the terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one to twelve months. currently, our largest foreign currency exposure is the euro, primarily because our european operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses. relative to foreign currency exposures existing at october 30, 2021 and october 31, 2020, a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of the year would result in approximately $39.5 million of losses and $18.5 million of losses, respectively, in changes in earnings or cash flows.
the market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rates that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. the counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings. based on the credit ratings of our counterparties as of october 30, 2021, we do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by them. while the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions, they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk. the amounts potentially subject to credit risk (arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties' obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties.
the following table illustrates the effect that a 10% unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, relative to the u.s. dollar, would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of october 30, 2021 and october 31, 2020:
october 30, 2021        october 31, 2020
fair value of forward exchange contracts                                                                                   $(8,085)                $5,427
fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates asset         $26,673                 $21,859
fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates liability       $(41,034)               $(20,276)
the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the u.s. dollar. in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors' products become more or less attractive. our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices.
report of independent registered public accounting firm the board of directors and shareholders analog devices, inc.
opinion on the financial statements we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of analog devices, inc. (the company) as of october 30, 2021 and october 31, 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended october 30, 2021, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index at item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the company at october 30, 2021 and october 31, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended october 30, 2021, in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.
we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob), the company's internal control over financial reporting as of october 30, 2021, based on criteria established in internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (2013 framework), and our report dated december 3, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
basis for opinion these financial statements are the responsibility of the company's management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's financial statements based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
critical audit matters the critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. the communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
revenue recognition - measuring variable consideration description of the matter        as described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the company's sales contracts provide certain distributors with credits for price protection and rights of return, which results in variable consideration. during 2021, sales to distributors were $4.6 billion net of expected price protection discounts and rights of return for which the liability balance as of october 30, 2021 was $664.2 million.
auditing the company's measurement of variable consideration under distributor contracts involved especially challenging judgment because the calculation involves subjective management assumptions about estimates of expected price protection discounts and returns. for example, estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price reflects management's evaluation of contractual terms, historical experience and assumptions about future economic conditions. changes in those assumptions can have a material effect on the amount of variable consideration recognized.
how we addressed the matter in our audit        we obtained an understanding over the company's process to calculate the variable consideration. with the exception of the portion of the balance that related to maxim integrated products, inc., we also evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the relevant controls. for example, we tested controls over the appropriateness of assumptions management used as well as controls over the completeness and accuracy of the data underlying estimates of expected price protection discounts and returns.
our audit procedures included, among others, inspecting contractual terms in distributor agreements and testing the underlying data used in management's calculation for completeness and accuracy as well as evaluating the significant assumptions used in the estimation of variable consideration. we evaluated the company's methods and assumptions used in the estimates, which included comparing the assumptions to historical trends. we inspected and tested the results of the company's retrospective review analysis of actual returns and price protection discounts claimed by distributors, evaluated the estimates made based on historical experience and performed sensitivity analyses of the company's significant assumptions to assess the impact on the variable consideration. we also evaluated whether the company appropriately considered new information that could significantly change the estimated future price protection discounts or returns.
accounting for acquisitions - valuation of identified intangibles description of the matter                       during 2021, the company completed its acquisition of maxim integrated products, inc. (maxim) for total consideration of $27.9 billion, as disclosed in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. the transaction was accounted for as a business combination.
auditing the company's accounting for its acquisition of maxim was complex due to the significant estimation uncertainty in the company's determination of the fair value of identifiable intangible assets of $12.4 billion, which principally consisted of developed technology and customer relationships. the significant estimation uncertainty was primarily due to the sensitivity of the respective fair values to underlying assumptions about the future performance of the acquired business. the company used discounted cash flow models to measure the developed technology and customer relationship intangible assets. the significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the intangible assets included discount rates and certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results (e.g., annual revenue growth rates, developed technology obsolescence rates and customer attrition rates). these significant assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.
how we addressed the matter in our audit        we obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the company's accounting for acquisitions process. for example, we tested controls over the appropriateness of the valuation model, assumptions management used as well as controls over the completeness and accuracy of the data underlying the valuation of the developed technology and customer relationship intangible assets.
to test the estimated fair value of the developed technology and customer relationship intangible assets, our audit procedures included, among others, assessing methodologies and testing the significant assumptions discussed above and the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions and estimates used by the company in the valuation. we tested significant assumptions through a combination of procedures, as applicable for each assumption, including comparing them to current and forecasted industry and economic trends, as well as to the historical results of the acquired business and other guideline companies within the same industry. with the assistance of our valuation specialists, we evaluated the methodology used by the company and significant assumptions included in the fair value estimates.
/s/ ernst & young llp we have served as the company's auditor since 1967.

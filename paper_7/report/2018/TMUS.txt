business overview un-carrier strategy we are the un-carrier. through our un-carrier strategy, we've disrupted the wireless communication services industry by listening to our customers and providing them with added value and an exceptional experience, including implementing signature initiatives that changed the wireless industry forever. these un-carrier initiatives include the following launched during 2018:
•   in august 2018, we introduced un-carrier next, a new initiative that radically changes the structure of our customer service department and solves several significant pain points for customers. postpaid customers will get directly through to a human when they call customer support, and that human will be one member of a "team of experts" devoted to that customer and other customers in their geographic region. no bots, no bouncing, no bs.
•   un-carrier next also provided customers exclusive access to a free one-year pandora plus subscription via the t-mobile tuesdays app in august 2018. in addition, we announced an exclusive multi-year partnership with live nation, the world's largest live entertainment company, giving un-carrier customers rock star status at live nation amphitheater and arena concerts, including access to last-minute reserve seats in sold-out sections and discounted tickets.
in september 2018, in connection with the rebranding of our prepaid brand, metropcs, as metro by t-mobile, we introduced new unlimited rate plans with tiers that feature added benefits of google one and amazon prime as well as an expanded selection of the latest and greatest smartphones. gone are the outdated perceptions that prepaid service is synonymous with limited coverage, cheap flip phones or bad credit.
our ability to acquire and retain branded customers is important to our business in the generation of revenues and we believe our un-carrier strategy, along with ongoing network improvements, has been successful in attracting and retaining customers as evidenced by continued branded customer growth and improved branded postpaid phone and branded prepaid customer churn.

acquisitions
•   on january 1, 2018, we closed on our previously announced unit purchase agreement to acquire the remaining equity in iowa wireless services, llc ("iws"), a 54% owned unconsolidated subsidiary, for a purchase price of $25 million. we accounted for our acquisition of iws as a business combination and recognized a bargain purchase gain of approximately $25 million as part of our purchase price allocation and a gain on our previously held equity interest of approximately $15 million in other income, net in 2018.

statement of cash flows on january 1, 2018, we adopted the new cash flow standard which impacted the presentation of our cash flows related to our beneficial interests in securitization transactions, which is the deferred purchase price, resulting in a reclassification of cash inflows from operating activities to investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. the new cash flow standard also impacted the presentation of our cash payments for debt prepayment and debt extinguishment costs, resulting in a reclassification of cash outflows from operating activities to financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. we have applied the new cash flow standard retrospectively to all periods presented. for additional information regarding the new cash flow standard and the impact of our adoption, see "selected financial data" and note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
financial instruments in january 2016, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued asu 2016-01, "financial instruments (topic 825): recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities." the standard addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. the standard became effective for us, and we adopted the standard, on january 1, 2018. the standard requires the impact of adoption to be recorded to retained earnings under a modified retrospective approach. the implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
income taxes in october 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-16, "accounting for income taxes: intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory." the standard requires that the income tax impact of intra-entity sales and transfers of property, except for inventory, be recognized when the transfer occurs. the standard became effective for us, and we adopted the standard, on january 1, 2018. the standard requires any deferred taxes not yet recognized on intra-entity transfers to be recorded to retained earnings under a modified retrospective approach. the implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
derivatives and hedging in august 2017, the fasb issued asu 2017-12, "derivatives and hedging (topic 815): targeted improvement to accounting for hedging activities." the standard modified the guidance for the designation and measurement of qualifying hedging relationships and the presentation of hedge results. we adopted this standard on october 1, 2018, and have applied the standard to hedging transactions prospectively.

hurricane impacts during 2018, we recognized $61 million in costs related to hurricanes, including $36 million in incremental costs to maintain services primarily in puerto rico related to hurricanes that occurred in 2017 and $25 million related to hurricanes that occurred in 2018. additional costs related to a hurricane that occurred in 2018 are expected to be immaterial in the first quarter of 2019.
during 2018, we received reimbursement payments from our insurance carriers of $307 million related to hurricanes, of which $93 million was previously accrued for as a receivable as of december 31, 2017.
we have accrued insurance recoveries related to a hurricane that occurred in 2018 of approximately $5 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 as an offset to the costs incurred within cost of services in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income and as an increase to other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets.
the following table shows the impacts of hurricanes to our results, operating metrics and non-gaap financial measures for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017. there were no significant hurricane impacts in 2016.

the following discussion and analysis is for the year ended december 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017 unless otherwise stated.
total revenues increased $2.7 billion, or 7%, as discussed below.
branded postpaid revenues increased $1.4 billion, or 7%, primarily from:
•   higher average branded postpaid phone customers, primarily from growth in our customer base driven by the continued growth in existing and greenfield markets including the growing success of new customer segments and rate plans such as t-mobile one unlimited 55+, t-mobile one military, t-mobile for business and t-mobile essentials, along with lower churn; and
•   higher average branded postpaid other customers; partially offset by
•   lower branded postpaid phone average revenue per user ("arpu"). see "branded postpaid phone arpu" in the "performance measures" section of this md&amp;a; and
•   the negative impact of the new revenue standard of $25 million, primarily due to the impact of certain promotions previously recognized as a reduction in equipment revenues now recognized as a reduction in branded postpaid revenues, partially offset by certain equipment revenues reclassified to branded postpaid revenues.
branded prepaid revenues increased $218 million, or 2%, primarily from:
•   higher average branded prepaid customers driven by the success of our metro by t-mobile brand; partially offset by
•   lower branded prepaid arpu. see "branded prepaid apru" in the "performance measures" section of this md&amp;a; and
•   the negative impact of the new revenue standard of $10 million, primarily due to the impact of certain promotions previously recognized as a reduction in equipment revenues now recognized as a reduction in branded prepaid revenues.
wholesale revenues increased $81 million, or 7%, primarily from the continued success of our mvno partnerships.
roaming and other service revenues increased $119 million, or 52%, primarily from an increase in international and domestic roaming revenues.
equipment revenues increased $634 million, or 7%, primarily from:
•   an increase of $1.1 billion in device sales revenues, excluding purchased leased devices, primarily due to:
•   higher average revenue per device sold due to an increase in the high-end device mix; and
•   a positive impact from the new revenue standard of $393 million primarily related to:
▪   commission costs of $438 million previously recorded as a reduction in equipment revenues now recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses and certain promotions previously recorded as a reduction in equipment revenues now recorded as a reduction in service revenues; partially offset by
▪   certain promotional bill credits now capitalized as contract assets and certain equipment revenues now recognized as service revenues; partially offset by
•   a 6% decrease in the number of devices sold, excluding purchased leased devices; partially offset by
•   a decrease of $310 million from lower volumes of purchased leased devices at the end of the lease term; and
•   a decrease of $185 million in lease revenues from jump! on demand customers preferring affordable device options on leasing programs with lower monthly lease payments and shifting focus to our eip financing option for high-end devices.
under our jump! on demand program, upon device upgrade or at lease end, customers must return or purchase their device. revenue for purchased leased devices is recorded as equipment revenues when revenue is recognition criteria have been met.

other revenues increased $240 million, or 22%, primarily due to revenue share agreements with third parties, the positive impact from $71 million in insurance reimbursements related to the hurricanes, and higher amortized imputed discount on eip receivables due to continued growth in eip sales.
our operating expenses consist of the following categories:
•   cost of services primarily includes costs directly attributable to providing wireless service through the operation of our network, including direct switch and cell site costs, such as rent, network access and transport costs, utilities, maintenance, associated labor costs, long distance costs, regulatory program costs, roaming fees paid to other carriers and data content costs. in addition, certain costs for customer appreciation programs are included in cost of services.
•   cost of equipment sales primarily includes costs of devices and accessories sold to customers and dealers, device costs to fulfill insurance and warranty claims, costs related to returned and purchased leased devices, write-downs of inventory related to shrinkage and obsolescence, and shipping and handling costs.
•   selling, general and administrative primarily includes costs not directly attributable to providing wireless service for the operation of sales, customer care and corporate activities. these include commissions paid to dealers and retail employees for activations and upgrades, labor and facilities costs associated with retail sales force and administrative space, marketing and promotional costs, customer support and billing, bad debt expense, losses from sales of receivables and back office administrative support activities.
operating expenses increased $2.3 billion, or 6%, primarily from higher selling, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization expense, cost of equipment sales, cost of services, and lower gains on disposal of spectrum licenses as discussed below.
cost of services increased $207 million, or 3%, primarily from:
•   higher lease, employee-related and repair and maintenance expenses associated with network expansion; and
•   the impact from the new revenue standard of $74 million primarily related to certain contract fulfillment costs reclassified to cost of services from selling, general and administrative expenses; partially offset by
•   lower regulatory program costs; and

•   a higher average cost per device sold, primarily due to an increase in the high-end device mix; partially offset by
•   a 6% decrease in the number of devices sold, excluding purchased lease devices. this increase was partially offset by
•   a decrease of $342 million in leased device cost of equipment sales, primarily from lower volumes of purchased leased devices at the end of the lease term; and
•   a decrease of $178 million primarily due to lower inventory adjustments and lower warranty program costs.
under our jump! on demand program, upon device upgrade or at the end of the lease term, customers must return or purchase their device. the cost of purchased leased devices is recorded as cost of equipment sales. returned devices transferred from property and equipment, net are recorded as inventory and are valued at the lower of cost or market with any write-down to market recognized as cost of equipment sales.

the change to the results of operations of our non-guarantor subsidiaries for the year ended december 31, 2018 was primarily from:
•   higher service revenues primarily due to an increase in activity of the non-guarantor subsidiary that provides device insurance, primarily driven by growth in our customer base and higher average revenue related to the new device protection product launched at the end of august 2018; partially offset by
•   higher selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to operating costs from the non-guarantor layer3 tv subsidiary acquired in the first quarter of 2018, an increase in customer notification expenses related to the new insurance product launched at the end of august 2018, and an increase in program expenses related to apple care service fees, partially offset by lower valuation losses in the non-guarantor subsidiary involved in the eip sale arrangement; and
•   higher cost of equipment sales primarily due to an increase in higher cost devices used for device insurance claims fulfillment, partially offset by an increase in device liquidations and a decrease in device non-return fees charged to customers.

performance measures in managing our business and assessing financial performance, we supplement the information provided by our financial statements with other operating or statistical data and non-gaap financial measures. these operating and financial measures are utilized by our management to evaluate our operating performance and, in certain cases, our ability to meet liquidity requirements. although companies in the wireless industry may not define each of these measures in precisely the same way, we believe that these measures facilitate comparisons with other companies in the wireless industry on key operating and financial measures.

(1)   as a result of the acquisition of iws, we included an adjustment of 13,000 branded postpaid phone and 4,000 branded prepaid iws customers in our reported subscriber base as of january 1, 2018. additionally, as a result of the acquisition of layer3 tv, we included an adjustment of 5,000 branded prepaid customers in our reported subscriber base as of january 22, 2018.
(2)   during 2017, we retitled our "branded postpaid mobile broadband customers" category to "branded postpaid other customers" and reclassified 253,000 digits customers from our "branded postpaid phone customers" category for the second quarter of 2017, when the digits product was released.
(3)   we believe current and future regulatory changes have made the lifeline program offered by our wholesale partners uneconomical. we will continue to support our wholesale partners offering the lifeline program, but have excluded the lifeline customers from our reported wholesale subscriber base resulting in the removal of 4,528,000 reported wholesale customers in 2017.
(4)   as a result of the mvno transaction, we included an adjustment of 1,365,000 branded postpaid phone customers and 326,000 branded prepaid customers to wholesale customers on september 1, 2016. prospectively from september 1, 2016, net customer additions for these customers are included within wholesale customers.
branded customers total branded customers increased 4,941,000, or 8%, in 2018 primarily from:
•   higher branded postpaid phone customers driven by the growing success of new customer segments and rate plans such as t-mobile one unlimited 55+, t-mobile one military, t-mobile for business and t-mobile essentials and continued growth in existing and greenfield markets, along with lower churn, partially offset by competitive activity;
•   higher branded postpaid other customers primarily due to higher gross customer additions from wearables; and
•   higher branded prepaid customers driven by the continued success of our metro by t-mobile brand due to promotional activities and rate plan offers.

wholesale wholesale customers increased 2,125,000, or 15%, in 2018 primarily due to the continued success of our m2m and mvno partnerships.

(1)   as a result of the acquisition of iws and layer3 tv, customer activity post acquisition was included in our net customer additions beginning in the first quarter of 2018.
(2)   during 2017, we retitled our "branded postpaid mobile broadband customers" category to "branded postpaid other customers" and included digits customers and reclassified 253,000 digits customer net additions from our "branded postpaid phone customers" category for the second quarter of 2017, when the digits product was released.
(3)   net customer activity for lifeline was excluded beginning in the second quarter of 2017, due to our determination based upon changes in the applicable government regulations that the lifeline program offered by our wholesale partners is uneconomical.
branded customers total branded net customer additions increased 444,000, or 10%, in 2018 primarily from:
•   higher branded postpaid other net customer additions primarily due to higher gross customer additions from wearables and lower churn, partially offset by lower gross customer additions from other connected devices; and
•   higher branded postpaid phone net customer additions primarily due to lower churn and continued growth in existing and greenfield markets including the growing success of new customer segments and rate plans such as t-mobile one unlimited 55+, t-mobile one military, t-mobile for business and t-mobile essentials, partially offset by the impact from more aggressive service promotions and the launch of un-carrier next - all unlimited with taxes and fees in the first quarter of 2017. these increases were partially offset by
•   lower branded prepaid net customer additions primarily due to increased competitive activity, partially offset by lower migrations to branded postpaid plans.
wholesale wholesale net customer additions increased 942,000, or 80%, in 2018 primarily due to lower deactivations driven by the removal of lifeline program customers.
customers per account customers per account is calculated by dividing the number of branded postpaid customers as of the end of the period by the number of branded postpaid accounts as of the end of the period. an account may include branded postpaid phone customers and branded postpaid other customers which includes digits and connected devices such as tablets, wearables and syncup drive. we believe branded postpaid customers per account provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to evaluate our branded postpaid customer base on a per account basis.

branded postpaid customers per account increased 3% in 2018 primarily from continued growth of new customer segments and rate plans such as t-mobile one unlimited 55+, t-mobile one military, t-mobile for business and t-mobile essentials, promotional activities targeting families and the success of connected devices.
churn churn represents the number of customers whose service was disconnected as a percentage of the average number of customers during the specified period. the number of customers whose service was disconnected is presented net of customers that subsequently have their service restored within a certain period of time. we believe that churn provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to evaluate customer retention and loyalty.
the following table sets forth the churn:

branded prepaid churn decreased 8 basis points in 2018, primarily due to the continued impact from the optimization of our third-party distribution channels which was substantially completed during the first quarter of 2017, partially offset by higher deactivations from a growing customer base and increased competitive activity.
average revenue per user, average billings per user average revenue per user ("arpu") represents the average monthly service revenue earned from customers. we believe arpu provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to assess and evaluate our service revenue realization per customer and assist in forecasting our future service revenues generated from our customer base. branded postpaid phone arpu excludes branded postpaid other customers and related revenues which includes digits and connected devices such as tablets, wearables and syncup drive.
average billings per user ("abpu") represents the average monthly customer billings, including monthly lease revenues and eip billings before securitization, per customer. we believe branded postpaid abpu was an important metric during the transition from classic plans to eip based plans as it helped explain the customer billing relationship in a period which had shifts in customer billings from branded postpaid service revenues to equipment sales revenues. we believe the usefulness of abpu to management, investors and analysts has decreased in recent periods as the remaining classic plan base is immaterial and branded postpaid service revenue and branded postpaid phone arpu metrics in periods presented are now comparable. we therefore plan to discontinue reporting abpu beginning with the quarter ending march 31, 2019.

branded postpaid phone arpu branded postpaid phone arpu decreased $0.57, or 1%, in 2018 primarily due to:
•   the growing success of new customer segments and rate plans such as t-mobile one unlimited 55+, t-mobile one military, t-mobile for business and t-mobile essentials;
•   the ongoing growth in our netflix offering, which totaled $0.35 for 2018 and decreased branded postpaid phone arpu by $0.32 compared to full-year 2017;
•   a reduction in certain non-recurring charges;
•   the negative impact of the new revenue standard of $0.05; partially offset by
•   a net reduction in promotional activities.
we continue to expect that branded postpaid phone arpu in full-year 2019 will be generally stable compared to full-year 2018.
branded postpaid abpu branded postpaid abpu decreased $2.05, or 3%, in 2018 primarily from:
•   lower branded postpaid phone arpu;
•   lower lease revenues; and
•   growth in the branded postpaid other customer base with a lower arpu than branded postpaid phone.

branded prepaid arpu branded prepaid arpu decreased $0.16 in 2018 primarily from dilution from promotional rate plans, partially offset by the continued growth of metro by t-mobile customers.
adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda represents earnings before interest expense, net of interest income, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation and certain income and expenses not reflective of our operating performance. net income margin represents net income divided by service revenues. adjusted ebitda margin represents adjusted ebitda divided by service revenues.
adjusted ebitda is a non-gaap financial measure utilized by our management to monitor the financial performance of our operations. we use adjusted ebitda internally as a measure to evaluate and compensate our personnel and management for their performance, and as a benchmark to evaluate our operating performance in comparison to our competitors. management believes analysts and investors use adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to evaluate overall operating performance and facilitate comparisons with other wireless communications companies because it is indicative of our ongoing operating performance and trends by excluding the impact of interest expense from financing, non-cash depreciation and amortization from capital investments, non-cash stock-based compensation, network decommissioning costs and costs related to the transactions, as they are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, as well as certain other nonrecurring income and expenses. adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income from operations, net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap").
the following table illustrates the calculation of adjusted ebitda and reconciles adjusted ebitda to net income, which we consider to be the most directly comparable gaap financial measure:

(1)   stock-based compensation includes payroll tax impacts and may not agree to stock-based compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements.
(2)   other, net may not agree to the consolidated statements of comprehensive income primarily due to certain non-routine operating activities, such as other special items that would not be expected to reoccur or are not reflective of t-mobile's ongoing operating performance, and are therefore excluded in adjusted ebitda.
adjusted ebitda increased $1.2 billion, or 11%, in 2018 primarily from:
•   higher service revenues, as further discussed above;
44
•   the positive impact from the new revenue standard of $398 million;
•   higher other revenues, as further discussed above;
•   lower losses on equipment;
•   the positive impact of the reimbursements from our insurance carriers, net of costs incurred related to hurricanes, for the year ended december 31, 2018 of $158 million, compared to costs incurred related to hurricanes, net of insurance recoveries, of $201 million in the year ended december 31, 2017; partially offset by
•   higher selling, general and administrative expenses;
•   lower gains on disposal of spectrum licenses of $235 million; and
•   higher cost of services.
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations, proceeds from issuance of long-term debt and common stock, capital leases, the sale of certain receivables, financing arrangements of vendor payables which effectively extend payment terms and secured and unsecured revolving credit facilities with dt. upon consummation of the transactions, we will incur substantial third-party indebtedness which will increase our future financial commitments, including aggregate interest payments on higher total indebtedness, and may adversely impact our liquidity. further, the incurrence of additional indebtedness may inhibit our ability to incur new debt under the terms governing our existing and future indebtedness, which may make it more difficult for us to incur new debt in the future to finance our business strategy.
cash flows on january 1, 2018, we adopted the new cash flow standard which impacted the presentation of our cash flows related to our beneficial interests in securitization transactions, which is the deferred purchase price, resulting in a reclassification of cash inflows from operating activities to investing activities of approximately $5.4 billion, $4.3 billion and $3.4 billion for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, in our consolidated statements of cash flows. the new cash flow standard also impacted the presentation of our cash payments for debt prepayment and debt extinguishment costs, resulting in a reclassification of cash outflows from operating activities to financing activities of $212 million and $188 million for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, in our consolidated statements of cash flows. there were no cash payments for debt prepayment and debt extinguishment costs during the year ended december 31, 2016. we have applied the new cash flow standard retrospectively to all periods presented.
for additional information regarding the new cash flow standard and the impact of our adoption, see "selected financial data" and note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
the following is a condensed schedule of our cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:
year ended december 31,                    2018 versus 2017                    2017 versus 2016

net cash (used in) provided by financing activities      (3,336    )           (1,367    )              463           (1,969    )         144      %      (1,830    )        (395   )%
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased $68 million, or 2%, primarily from higher net non-cash adjustments to net income, partially offset by lower net income and higher net cash outflows from working capital changes.
•   the change in net income and the net non-cash adjustments to net income were primarily from the impacts of the tcja in 2017 and the absence of gains on disposal of spectrum licenses in 2018.
•   the higher net use in working capital was primarily from a paydown of accounts payable and changes in accounts receivable, partially offset by changes in inventories and eip receivables.
45
investing activities net cash used in investing activities decreased $6.2 billion, or 91%, to a use of $579 million for 2018.
the use of cash for the year ended december 31, 2018 was primarily from:
•   $5.5 billion in purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest, primarily driven by growth in network build as we continued deployment of low band spectrum, including the continued deployment of 600 mhz, and started laying the groundwork for 5g; and
•   $338 million of cash consideration paid, net of cash acquired, for the acquisitions of layer3 tv and iws; partially offset by
•   $5.4 billion in proceeds related to beneficial interest in securitization transactions.
financing activities net cash (used in) provided by financing activities increased $2.0 billion, or 144%, to a use of $3.3 billion for 2018.
the use of cash for the year ended december 31, 2018 was primarily from:
•   $6.3 billion for repayments of our revolving credit facility;
•   $3.3 billion for repayments of long-term debt;
•   $1.1 billion for repurchases of common stock; and
•   $700 million for repayments of capital lease obligations; partially offset by
•   $6.3 billion in proceeds from borrowing on our revolving credit facility; and
•   $2.5 billion in proceeds from issuance of long-term debt.
cash and cash equivalents as of december 31, 2018, our cash and cash equivalents were $1.2 billion.
free cash flow free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less payments for purchases of property and equipment, including proceeds related to beneficial interests in securitization transactions and less cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs. free cash flow is a non-gaap financial measure utilized by our management, investors and analysts of our financial information to evaluate cash available to pay debt and provide further investment in the business.
in the first quarter of 2018, we redefined our non-gaap financial measure free cash flow to reflect the adoption of the new cash flow standard to present cash flows on a consistent basis for investor transparency. we have applied the change in definition retrospectively in the table below, which illustrates the calculation of free cash flow and reconciles free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities, which we consider to be the most directly comparable gaap financial measure:
year ended december 31,                  2018 versus 2017                        2017 versus 2016

46
free cash flow increased $827 million, or 30%, for 2018 from:
•   higher proceeds related to our deferred purchase price from securitization transactions and net cash provided by operating activities; partially offset by
•   higher purchases of property and equipment, net of capitalized interest of $362 million and $136 million for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. the increase in cash purchases of property and equipment was primarily due to growth in network build as we continued deployment of low band spectrum, including the continued deployment of 600 mhz, and started laying the groundwork for 5g.
borrowing capacity and debt financing as of december 31, 2018, our total debt was $27.5 billion, excluding our tower obligations, of which $26.7 billion was classified as long-term debt. see note 8 - debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of our debt to third parties and debt to affiliates.
in december 2016, t-mobile usa entered into a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility with dt which is comprised of (i) a three-year $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement and (ii) a three-year $1.5 billion secured revolving credit agreement. in january 2018, we utilized proceeds under the revolving credit facility to redeem $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of our 6.125% senior notes due 2022 and for general corporate purposes. on january 29, 2018, the proceeds utilized under our revolving credit facility with dt were repaid. as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. in november 2018, we amended the terms of the revolving credit facility with dt to extend the maturity date to december 29, 2021.
we maintain a handset financing arrangement with deutsche bank ag ("deutsche bank"), which allows for up to $108 million in borrowings. under the handset financing arrangement, we can effectively extend payment terms for invoices payable to certain handset vendors. as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, there was no outstanding balance.
we maintain vendor financing arrangements with our primary network equipment suppliers. under the respective agreements, we can obtain extended financing terms. as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, there was no outstanding balance.
consents on debt to third parties on may 18, 2018, under the terms and conditions described in the consent solicitation statement, we obtained consents necessary to effect certain amendments to our senior notes to third parties in connection with the business combination agreement. pursuant to the consent solicitation statement, third-party note holders agreed, among other things, to consent to increasing the amount of secured indebtedness under credit facilities that can be incurred from the greater of $9 billion and 150% of consolidated cash flow to the greater of $9 billion and an amount that would not cause the secured debt to cash flow ratio (calculated net of cash and cash equivalents) to exceed 2.00x (the "ratio secured debt proposed amendments") and in each case as such capitalized term is defined in the indenture. in connection with receiving the requisite consents for the ratio secured debt proposed amendments, we made upfront payments to third-party note holders of $17 million during the second quarter of 2018. these payments were recognized as a reduction to long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets. these upfront payments increased the effective interest rate of the related debt.
in addition, note holders agreed, among other things, to allow certain entities related to sprint's existing spectrum securitization notes program ("existing sprint spectrum program") to be non-guarantor restricted subsidiaries, provided that the principal amount of the spectrum notes issued and outstanding under the existing sprint spectrum program does not exceed $7.0 billion and that the principal amount of such spectrum notes reduces the amount available under the credit facilities ratio basket, and to revise the definition of gaap to mean generally accepted accounting principles in effect from time to time, unless the company elects to "freeze" gaap as of any date, and to exclude the effect of the changes in the accounting treatment of lease obligations (the "existing sprint spectrum and gaap proposed amendments," and together with the ratio secured debt proposed amendments, the "proposed amendments"). in connection with receiving the requisite consents for the existing sprint spectrum and gaap proposed amendments, we made upfront payments to third-party note holders of $14 million during the second quarter of 2018. these payments were recognized as a reduction to long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets. these upfront payments increased the effective interest rate of the related debt.
in connection with obtaining the requisite consents, on may 20, 2018, t-mobile usa, the guarantors and deutsche bank trust company americas, as trustee, executed and delivered the 37th supplemental indenture to the indenture, pursuant to which, with respect to each of the notes, the proposed amendments will become effective immediately prior to the consummation of the merger.
47
we paid third-party bank fees associated with obtaining the requisite consents related to the proposed amendments of $6 million during the second quarter of 2018, which we recognized as selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. if the merger is consummated, we will make additional payments to third-party note holders for requisite consents related to the ratio secured debt proposed amendments of up to $54 million and additional payments to third-party note holders for requisite consents related to the existing sprint spectrum and gaap proposed amendments of up to $41 million. we have not accrued these payments as of december 31, 2018.
see note 8 - debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
future sources and uses of liquidity we may seek additional sources of liquidity, including through the issuance of additional long-term debt in 2019, to continue to opportunistically acquire spectrum licenses or other assets in private party transactions or for the refinancing of existing long-term debt on an opportunistic basis. excluding liquidity that could be needed for spectrum acquisitions, or for other assets, we expect our principal sources of funding to be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity needs for business operations for the next 12 months as well as our longer-term liquidity needs. our intended use of any such funds is for general corporate purposes, including for capital expenditures, spectrum purchases, opportunistic investments and acquisitions, redemption of high yield callable debt and stock purchases.
we determine future liquidity requirements, for both operations and capital expenditures, based in large part upon projected financial and operating performance, and opportunities to acquire additional spectrum. we regularly review and update these projections for changes in current and projected financial and operating results, general economic conditions, the competitive landscape and other factors. there are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our financial and operating results and capital requirements to differ materially from our projections, which could cause future liquidity to differ materially from our assessment.
the indentures and credit facilities governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties, excluding capital leases, contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the issuer and the guarantor subsidiaries to: incur more debt; pay dividends and make distributions on our common stock; make certain investments; repurchase stock; create liens or other encumbrances; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter into transactions that restrict dividends or distributions from subsidiaries; and merge, consolidate or sell, or otherwise dispose of, substantially all of their assets. certain provisions of each of the credit facilities, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties restrict the ability of the issuer to loan funds or make payments to the parent. however, the issuer is allowed to make certain permitted payments to the parent under the terms of each of the credit facilities, indentures and supplemental indentures relating to the long-term debt to affiliates and third parties. we were in compliance with all restrictive debt covenants as of december 31, 2018.
capital lease facilities we have entered into uncommitted capital lease facilities with certain partners, which provide us with the ability to enter into capital leases for network equipment and services. as of december 31, 2018, we have committed to $3.0 billion of capital leases under these capital lease facilities, of which $885 million was executed during the year ended december 31, 2018.
capital expenditures our liquidity requirements have been driven primarily by capital expenditures for spectrum licenses and the construction, expansion and upgrading of our network infrastructure. property and equipment capital expenditures primarily relate to our network transformation, including the build-out of 600 mhz low-band spectrum licenses. we expect cash purchases of property and equipment, excluding capitalized interest of approximately $400 million, to be $5.4 to $5.7 billion and cash purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest, to be to be $5.8 to $6.1 billion in 2019. this includes expenditures for 600 mhz and 5g deployment. this does not include property and equipment obtained through capital lease agreements, leased wireless devices transferred from inventory or any additional purchases of spectrum licenses.
share repurchases on december 6, 2017, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program for up to $1.5 billion of our common stock through december 31, 2018 (the "2017 stock repurchase program"). repurchased shares are retired. the 2017 stock repurchase program completed on april 29, 2018.
48
on april 27, 2018, our board of directors authorized an increase in the total stock repurchase program to $9.0 billion, consisting of the $1.5 billion in repurchases previously completed and up to an additional $7.5 billion of repurchases of our common stock. the additional $7.5 billion repurchase authorization is contingent upon the termination of the business combination agreement and the abandonment of the transactions contemplated under the business combination agreement. see note 12 - repurchases of common stock of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
dividends we have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. our credit facilities and the indentures and supplemental indentures governing our long-term debt to affiliates and third parties, excluding capital leases, contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to declare or pay dividends on our common stock.

certain commitments and obligations are included in the table based on the year of required payment or an estimate of the year of payment. other long-term liabilities, excluding network decommissioning, have been omitted from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments, combined with the absence of historical trending to be used as a predictor of such payments. see note 16 - additional financial information of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
the purchase obligations reflected in the table above are primarily commitments to purchase handsets and accessories, equipment, software, programming and network services and marketing activities, which will be used or sold in the ordinary course of business. these amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which we are contractually committed. where we are committed to make a minimum payment to the supplier regardless of whether we take delivery, we have included only that minimum payment as a purchase obligation. additionally, included within purchase obligations are amounts for the acquisition of spectrum licenses, which are subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions.

in october 2018, we entered into, and designated, interest rate lock derivatives as cash flow hedges to reduce variability in cash flows due to changes in interest payments attributable to increases or decreases in the benchmark interest rate during the period leading up to the probable issuance of fixed-rate debt. the fair value of interest rate lock derivatives as of december 31, 2018 was $447 million and is included in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. balances related to the cash flow hedges have been omitted from the table above due to the uncertainty of the amount and timing of settlements. see note 7 - fair value measurements of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
off-balance sheet arrangements we have arrangements, as amended from time to time, to sell certain eip accounts receivable and service accounts receivable on a revolving basis as a source of liquidity. as of december 31, 2018, we derecognized net receivables of $2.6 billion upon sale through these arrangements. see note 4 - sales of certain receivables of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
related party transactions during the year ended december 31, 2018, we entered into certain debt-related transactions with affiliates. see note 8 - debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
in the first quarter of 2018, dt, our majority stockholder and an affiliated purchaser, purchased 3.3 million additional shares of our common stock at an aggregate market value of $200 million in the public market or from other parties, in accordance with the rules of the sec and other applicable legal requirements. there were no purchases in the remainder of 2018. we did not receive proceeds from these purchases. see note 12 - repurchases of common stock of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
we also have related party transactions associated with dt or its affiliates in the ordinary course of business, including intercompany servicing and licensing.
disclosure of iranian activities under section 13(r) of the securities exchange act of 1934
section 219 of the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 added section 13(r) to the exchange act of 1934, as amended ("exchange act"). section 13(r) requires an issuer to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to iran or with designated natural persons or entities involved in terrorism or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. disclosure is required even where the activities, transactions or dealings are conducted outside the u.s. by non-u.s. affiliates in compliance with applicable law, and whether or not the activities are sanctionable under u.s. law.
as of the date of this report, we are not aware of any activity, transaction or dealing by us or any of our affiliates for the year ended december 31, 2018, that requires disclosure in this report under section 13(r) of the exchange act, except as set forth below with respect to affiliates that we do not control and that are our affiliates solely due to their common control with dt. we have relied upon dt for information regarding their activities, transactions and dealings.
dt, through certain of its non-u.s. subsidiaries, is party to roaming and interconnect agreements with the following mobile and fixed line telecommunication providers in iran, some of which are or may be government-controlled entities: gostaresh ertebatat taliya, irancell telecommunications services company, telecommunication kish company, mobile telecommunication company of iran, and telecommunication infrastructure company of iran. in addition, dt, through certain of its non-u.s. subsidiaries, provided basic telecommunications services in 2018 to telecommunication company of iran and to three customers in germany identified on the specially designated nationals and blocked persons list maintained by the u.s. department of treasury's office of foreign assets control: bank melli, bank sepah, and europäisch-iranische handelsbank. these services have been terminated or are in the process of being terminated. for the year ended december 31, 2018, gross revenues of all dt affiliates generated by roaming and interconnection traffic and telecommunications services with the iranian parties identified herein were less than $1 million, and the estimated net profits were less than $1 million.
in addition, dt, through certain of its non-u.s. subsidiaries, operating a fixed-line network in their respective european home countries (in particular germany), provides telecommunications services in the ordinary course of business to the embassy of iran in those european countries. gross revenues and net profits recorded from these activities for the year ended december 31, 2018 were less than $0.1 million. we understand that dt intends to continue these activities.

critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our results of operations and financial condition as they require that we use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
seven of these policies, below, are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or inputs. actual results could differ from those estimates.
management and the audit committee of the board of directors have reviewed and approved these critical accounting policies.
revenue recognition we primarily generate our revenue from providing wireless services to customers and selling or leasing devices and accessories. our contracts with customers may involve multiple performance obligations, which include wireless services, wireless devices or a combination thereof, and we allocate the transaction price between each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price.
significant judgments the most significant judgments affecting the amount and timing of revenue from contracts with our customers include the following items:
•   revenue for service contracts that we assess are not probable of collection is not recognized until the contract is completed and cash is received. collectibility is re-assessed when there is a significant change in facts or circumstances. our assessment of collectibility considers whether we may limit our exposure to credit risk through our right to stop transferring additional service in the event the customer is delinquent as well as certain contract terms such as down payments that reduce our exposure to credit risk. customer credit behavior is inherently uncertain. see "allowances," below, for more discussion on how we assess credit risk.
•   promotional eip bill credits offered to a customer on an equipment sale that are paid over time and are contingent on the customer maintaining a service contract may result in an extended service contract based on whether a substantive penalty is deemed to exist. determining whether contingent eip bill credits result in a substantive termination penalty may require significant judgment.
•   the identification of distinct performance obligations within our service plans may require significant judgment.
•   revenue is recorded net of costs paid to another party for performance obligations where we arrange for the other party to transfer goods or services to the customer (i.e., when we are acting as an agent). for example, performance obligations relating to services provided by third-party content providers where we neither controls a right to the content provider's service nor controls the underlying service itself are presented net because we are acting as an agent. the determination of whether we control the underlying service or right to the service prior to our transfer to the customer requires, at times, significant judgment.
•   for transactions where we recognize a significant financing component, judgment is required to determine the discount rate. for eip sales, the discount rate used to adjust the transaction price primarily reflects current market interest rates and the estimated credit risk of the customer. customer credit behavior is inherently uncertain. see "allowances", below, for more discussion on how we assess credit risk.
•   our products are generally sold with a right of return, which is accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. device return levels are estimated based on the expected value method as there are a large number of contracts with similar characteristics and the outcome of each contract is independent of the others. historical return rate experience is a significant input to our expected value methodology.
•   sales of equipment to indirect dealers who have been identified as our customer (referred to as the sell-in model) often include credits subsequently paid to the dealer as a reimbursement for any discount promotions offered to the end consumer. these credits (payments to a customer) are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize from the sales of equipment to indirect dealers and are estimated based on historical experience and other factors, such as expected promotional activity.
•   the determination of the standalone selling price for contracts that involve more than one performance obligation may require significant judgment, such as when the selling price of a good or service is not readily observable.
•   for capitalized contract costs, determining the amortization period over which such costs are recognized as well as assessing the indicators of impairment may require significant judgment.
51
allowances we maintain an allowance for credit losses, which is management's estimate of such losses inherent in our receivables portfolio, comprised of accounts receivable and eip receivable segments. changes in the allowance for credit losses and, therefore, in related provision for credit losses ("bad debt expense") can materially affect earnings. credit risk characteristics are assessed for each receivable segment. in applying the judgment and review required to determine the allowance for credit losses, management considers a number of factors, including receivable volumes, receivable delinquency status, historical loss experience and other conditions influencing loss expectations, such as macro-economic conditions. while our methodology attributes portions of the allowance to specific portfolio segments, the entire allowance for credit losses is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total receivables portfolio.
management also considers an amount that represents management's judgment of risks inherent in the process and assumptions used in establishing the allowance for credit losses, including process risk and other subjective factors, including industry trends and emerging risk assessments.
to the extent that actual loss experience differs significantly from historical trends or assumptions, the appropriate allowance levels for realized credit losses could differ from the estimate. we write off account balances if collection efforts are unsuccessful and the receivable balance is deemed uncollectible, based on customer credit ratings and the length of time from the original billing date.
we offer certain retail customers the option to pay for their devices and other purchases in installments over a period of up to 36 months using an eip. eip receivables not held for sale are reported in our consolidated balance sheets at outstanding principal adjusted for any charge-offs, allowance for credit losses and unamortized discounts. receivables held for sale are reported at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. at the time of an installment sale, we impute a discount for interest if the eip term exceeds 12 months as there is no stated rate of interest on the eip receivables. the eip receivables are recorded at their present value, which is determined by discounting future cash payments at the imputed interest rate. the difference between the recorded amount of the eip receivables and their unpaid principal balance (i.e., the contractual amount due from the customer) results in a discount which is recorded as a reduction in transaction price and allocated to the performance obligations of the arrangement. we determine the imputed discount rate based primarily on current market interest rates and the estimated credit risk on the eip receivables. as a result, we do not recognize a separate credit loss allowance at the time of issuance as the effects of uncertainty about future cash flows resulting from credit risk are included in the initial present value measurement of the receivable. the imputed discount on eip receivables is amortized over the financed installment term using the effective interest method and recognized as other revenues in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
subsequent to the initial determination of the imputed discount, we assess the need for and, if necessary, recognize an allowance for credit losses to the extent the amount of estimated probable losses on the gross eip receivable balances exceed the remaining unamortized imputed discount balances.
total imputed discount and allowances was approximately 8.1% of the total amount of gross accounts receivable, including eip receivables at both december 31, 2018 and 2017.
deferred purchase price assets in connection with the sales of certain service and eip accounts receivable pursuant to the sale arrangements, we have deferred purchase price assets measured at fair value that are based on a discounted cash flow model using unobservable level 3 inputs, including customer default rates and credit worthiness, dilutions and recoveries. see note 4 - sales of certain receivables for further information.
depreciation depreciation commences once assets have been placed in service. we generally depreciate property and equipment over the period the property and equipment provide economic benefit. leased wireless devices are depreciated to their estimated residual value over the period expected to provide utility to us, which is generally shorter than the lease term and considers expected losses. depreciable life studies are performed periodically to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable lives for certain categories of property, plant and equipment. these studies consider actual usage, physical wear and tear, replacement history and assumptions about technology evolution. when these factors indicate that the useful life of an asset is different from the previous assessment, the remaining book values are depreciated prospectively over the adjusted remaining estimated useful
52
life. see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies and note 5 - property and equipment of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding depreciation of assets, including management's underlying estimates of useful lives.
evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment we assess the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our spectrum licenses, for potential impairment annually as of december 31, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate such assets might be impaired.
when assessing goodwill for impairment we may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. if we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we perform a quantitative test. we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
the fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a market approach, which is based on market capitalization. we recognize market capitalization is subject to volatility and will monitor changes in market capitalization to determine whether declines, if any, necessitate an interim impairment review. in the event market capitalization does decline below its book value, we will consider the length, severity and reasons for the decline when assessing whether potential impairment exists, including considering whether a control premium should be added to the market capitalization. we believe short-term fluctuations in share price may not necessarily reflect the underlying aggregate fair value.
we test spectrum licenses for impairment on an aggregate basis, consistent with our management of the overall business at a national level. we may elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible asset is less than its carrying value. if we do not perform the qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset. if the estimated fair value of the spectrum licenses is lower than their carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized. we estimate fair value using the greenfield methodology, which is an income approach, to estimate the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. the greenfield methodology values the spectrum licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except the asset to be valued (in this case, spectrum licenses). the value of the spectrum licenses can be considered as equal to the present value of the cash flows of this hypothetical start-up company. we base the assumptions underlying the greenfield methodology on a combination of market participant data and our historical results, trends and business plans. future cash flows in the greenfield methodology are based on estimates and assumptions of market participant revenues, ebitda margin, network build-out period and a long-term growth rate for a market participant. the cash flows are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital.
the valuation approaches utilized to estimate fair value for the purposes of the impairment tests of goodwill and spectrum licenses require the use of assumptions and estimates, which involve a degree of uncertainty. if actual results or future expectations are not consistent with the assumptions, this may result in the recording of significant impairment charges on goodwill or spectrum licenses. the most significant assumptions within the valuation models are the discount rate, revenues, ebitda margins, capital expenditures and the long-term growth rate. see note 1 - summary of significant accounting policies and note 6 - goodwill, spectrum licenses and other intangible assets of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our annual impairment test and impairment charges.
rent expense we have operating leases for cell sites, retail locations, corporate offices and dedicated transportation lines, some of which have escalating rentals during the initial lease term and during subsequent optional renewal periods. we recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis, over the non-cancelable lease term and renewal periods that are considered reasonably assured at the inception of the lease. we consider several factors in assessing whether renewal periods are reasonably assured of being exercised, including the continued maturation of our network nationwide, technological advances within the telecommunications industry and the availability of alternative sites.
53
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these differences are realized. a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. the ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions within the carryforward periods available.
we account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with the accounting guidance for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. we assess whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position and adjust the unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this 2018 form 10-k to enhance the understanding of our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
executive summary bristol-myers squibb company is a global specialty biopharmaceutical company whose mission is to discover, develop and deliver innovative medicines that help patients prevail over serious diseases. refer to the summary of abbreviated terms at the end of this 2018 form 10-k for terms used throughout the document.
in 2018, we received 14 approvals for new medicines and additional indications and formulations of currently marketed medicines in major markets (the u.s., eu, japan and china) including multiple regulatory milestone achievements for opdivo and opdivo+yervoy combinations. we are committed to investigating opdivo alone and in combination with yervoy and other anti-cancer agents for a wide array of tumor types, including broad programs in lung, head & neck, liver, kidney, bladder and stomach. we continue to believe that the breadth and depth of our io portfolio positions us well for the future. we have 17 new io compounds in clinical development and studies across more than 35 different tumor types. in addition, we advanced certain other non-io r&d programs in our pipeline, including tyk2 inhibitor for the treatment of psoriasis and other autoimmune diseases, factor xia inhibitor for the treatment of thrombosis (in collaboration with janssen), and pegbelfermin (peg-fgf21) for the treatment of nash.
in 2018, our revenues increased 9% as a result of higher demand for our prioritized brands including opdivo and eliquis partially offset by increased competition for established brands, primarily hiv brands and daklinza. the $2.40 increase in gaap eps was primarily due to 2017 tax charges attributed to tax reform and higher revenues. these items were partially offset by higher losses on equity investments. after adjusting for the impact of tax reform, equity investment losses and other specified items, non-gaap eps increased $0.97 primarily as a result of higher revenues, higher royalties and licensing income and a lower effective tax rate. cost savings resulting from our transformation initiatives continue to be redeployed in r&d and other areas of higher priorities.
on january 3, 2019, we announced that we have entered into a definitive merger agreement with celgene under which we will acquire celgene. for further discussion on our pending acquisition with celgene and on our other acquisitions, divestitures and licensing arrangements, refer to "item 1a. risk factors," "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 4. acquisitions, divestitures, licensing and other arrangements" and "-note 19. subsequent event."
in 2017, our revenues increased 7% as a result of higher demand for our prioritized brands including opdivo and eliquis partially offset by increased competition for established brands, primarily daklinza. the $2.04 decrease in gaap eps was due to tax charges attributed to tax reform ($1.76 per share) and to a lesser extent higher license, asset acquisition and restructuring related charges and lower divestiture- related income. these items were partially offset by higher revenues, royalties and licensing income and a patent-infringement settlement. after adjusting for the impact of tax reform and other specified items, non-gaap eps increased $0.18 primarily as a result of higher revenues partially offset by product mix and higher r&d expenses supporting opdivo and other io programs.

strategy our focus as a specialty biopharmaceutical company is on discovering, developing and delivering transformational medicines that address serious unmet medical needs. our strategy is to combine the resources, scale and capability of a pharmaceutical company with the speed and focus on innovation of the biotech industry. our four strategic priorities are to drive business performance, continue to build a leading franchise in io, maintain a diversified portfolio both within and outside of io, and continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation, including establishing partnerships, collaborations and in-licensing or acquiring investigational compounds as an essential component of successfully delivering transformational medicines to patients.
we are developing new medicines in the following core therapeutic areas: (1) oncology with a priority in certain tumor types; (2) immunoscience with priorities in psoriasis, lupus, ra and inflammatory bowel disease; (3) cardiovascular with a priority in heart disease and; (4) fibrotic disease with priorities in lung and liver. we continue to advance the next wave of innovative medicines by investing significantly in our pipeline both internally and through business development activities. we expect that our planned acquisition of celgene will further position us as a leading biopharmaceutical company, expanding our oncology and immunoscience portfolios with several near-term assets and additional external partnerships. we continue to invest in our io portfolio by pursuing both monotherapy and combination approaches, and advancing our next wave of early assets. we entered into several new collaboration agreements across our therapeutic areas of focus and expanded others to research and develop opdivo and other approved or investigational oncology agents in combination regimens. we remain focused and well-resourced in our cancer development programs and seek to broaden the use of opdivo in earlier lines of therapy, expand into new tumors, accelerate next wave io mechanisms and develop treatment options for refractory io patients. beyond cancer, we continue to advance our early stage portfolio in immunoscience, cardiovascular and fibrotic diseases and strengthen our partnerships with a diverse group of companies and academic institutions in new and expanded research activities. we believe our differentiated internal and external focus contributes to the advancing of our pipeline of potentially transformational medicines.
our commercial model has been evolving and revenues from our prioritized brands continue to grow which demonstrates strong execution of our strategy. we continue to drive growth of opdivo by expanding into additional indications and tumor types both as a monotherapy and in combination with yervoy and other anti-cancer agents. eliquis continues to grow, leveraging its best in class clinical profile and extensive real world data and is now the number one novel oral anticoagulant in total prescriptions in the u.s. we are building on the continued success of our other prioritized brands and remain strongly committed to orencia and sprycel. through our operating model transformation, our commercial infrastructure is uniquely leveraged for potential growth.
our operating model continues to evolve and we have been successful in focusing commercial, r&d and manufacturing resources on prioritized brands and markets, strengthening our r&d capabilities in tumor biology, patient selection and new biomarkers, delivering leaner administrative functions and streamlining our manufacturing network to reflect the importance of biologics in our current and future portfolio. the evolution in our operating model, which focuses on maintaining a disciplined approach in marketing, selling and administrative expenses, will enable us to deliver the necessary strategic, financial and operational flexibility to invest in the highest priority opportunities within our portfolio.
looking ahead, we will continue to implement our biopharma strategy by driving the growth of prioritized brands, executing product launches, investing in our diverse and innovative pipeline, aided by strategic business development, focusing on prioritized markets, increasing investments in our biologics manufacturing capabilities and maintaining a culture of continuous improvement.
acquisitions, divestitures, licensing and collaboration arrangements acquisitions, divestitures, licensing and collaboration arrangements allow us to focus our resources behind our growth opportunities that drive the greatest long-term value. we are focused on the following core therapeutic areas: oncology, including io, immunoscience, cardiovascular and fibrosis. significant acquisitions, divestitures and licensing and collaboration arrangements during the past three years are summarized below. refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data -note 3. alliances" and "-note 4. acquisitions, divestitures, licensing and other arrangements" for further information.

gtn adjustments are primarily a function of product sales volume, regional and payer channel mix, contractual or legislative discounts and rebates. gtn adjustments are increasing at a higher rate than gross product sales due to higher u.s. eliquis gross product sales, which has a relatively high gtn adjustment percentage as a result of competitive pressures to maintain its position on healthcare payer formularies allowing patients continued access through their medical plans.

•   international revenues remained unchanged in 2018. international revenues increased in 2017 due to higher demand. we may experience a decline in european revenues in the event that generic datasinib product enters the market.
yervoy (ipilimumab) - a monoclonal antibody for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.
•   u.s. revenues increased in both periods due to higher demand. revenue growth rate in 2018 decreased due to lower demand resulting from other io products being used in the adjuvant treatment of patients with melanoma, including opdivo.

sustiva, an hiv product, had 1.1 months of inventory on hand internationally at direct customers compared to 1.0 months of inventory on hand at june 30, 2018. the level of inventory on hand was attributable to low volume in-market sales in canada.
in the u.s., we generally determine our months on hand estimates using inventory levels of product on hand and the amount of out-movement provided by our three largest wholesalers, which account for approximately 97% of total gross sales of u.s. products. factors that may influence our estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, wholesaler purchases in light of increases in wholesaler list prices, new product launches, new warehouse openings by wholesalers and new customer stockings by wholesalers. in addition, these estimates are calculated using third-party data, which may be impacted by their recordkeeping processes.

our non-u.s. businesses have significantly more direct customers. information on available direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information varies widely. we limit our direct customer sales channel inventory reporting to where we can influence demand. when this information does not exist or is otherwise not available, we have developed a variety of methodologies to estimate such data, including using historical sales made to direct customers and third-party market research data related to prescription trends and end-user demand. given the difficulties inherent in estimating third-party demand information, we evaluate our methodologies to estimate direct customer product level inventory and to calculate months on hand on an ongoing basis and make changes as necessary. factors that may affect our estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, price increases, new product launches, new warehouse openings by direct customers, new customer stockings by direct customers and expected direct customer purchases for governmental bidding situations. as such, all of the information required to estimate months on hand in the direct customer distribution channel for non-u.s. business for the year ended december 31, 2018 is not available prior to the filing of this 2018 form 10-k. we will disclose any product with levels of inventory in excess of one month on hand or expected demand, subject to a de minimis exception, in the next quarterly report on form 10-q.

impact of specified items              -                60.0   %             1.8   %
changes in the effective tax rate was primarily due to new u.s. tax reform legislation known as the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (the act) enacted on december 22, 2017. the act moved from a worldwide tax system to a quasi-territorial tax system and was comprised of broad and complex changes to the u.s. tax code including, but not limited to, (1) reduced the u.s. tax rate from 35% to 21%; (2) added a deemed repatriation transition tax on certain foreign earnings and profits; (3) generally eliminated u.s. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (4) included certain income of controlled foreign companies in u.s. taxable income (gilti); (5) created a new minimum tax referred to as a base erosion anti-abuse income tax; (6) limited certain research-based credits; and (7) eliminated the domestic manufacturing deduction.
although many aspects of the act were not effective until 2018, additional tax expense of $2.9 billion was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017 upon enactment of the act. the additional expense increased the effective tax rate by 56.7% and included a $2.6 billion one-time deemed repatriation transition tax on previously untaxed post-1986 foreign earnings and profits (including related tax reserves). those earnings were effectively taxed at a 15.5% rate to the extent that the specified foreign corporations held cash and certain other assets and an 8.0% rate on the remaining earnings and profits. the remaining $285 million of additional tax expense included an adjustment to measure net deferred tax assets at the new u.s. tax rate of 21%. the accounting for the reduction of deferred tax assets to the 21% tax rate was complete as of december 31, 2017. the provisional tax charge for the deemed repatriation transition tax was reduced by $56 million in 2018 upon completion of the accounting which reduced the effective tax rate by 0.9%.
in addition, the tax impact attributed to specified items, including non-deductible r&d charges, valuation allowances for certain tax assets resulting from equity investment losses and other jurisdiction tax rates increased the effective tax rate by 0.9% in 2018, 3.3% in 2017 and 1.8% in 2016.
after considering the impact of specified items including the transitional impacts of the act discussed above, the effective tax rate decreased by 3.9% in 2018 primarily due to the on-going impact of the act and tax reserve releases partially offset by taxes attributed to internal cash repatriations and earnings mix between high and low tax jurisdictions. after considering the impact of specified items, the effective tax rate decreased by 1.0% in 2017 primarily due to the adoption of amended income tax accounting guidance related to share-based payments and the early adoption of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory partially offset by earnings mix between high and low tax jurisdictions. refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 7. income taxes" for further information.
non-gaap financial measures our non-gaap financial measures, including non-gaap earnings and related eps information, are adjusted to exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items that are evaluated on an individual basis. these items are adjusted after considering their quantitative and qualitative aspects and typically have one or more of the following characteristics, such as being highly variable, difficult to project, unusual in nature, significant to the results of a particular period or not indicative of future operating results. similar charges or gains were recognized in prior periods and will likely reoccur in future periods including restructuring costs, accelerated depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, r&d charges in connection with the acquisition or licensing of third-party intellectual property rights, divestiture gains or losses, pension, legal and other contractual settlement charges and debt redemption gains or losses, among other items. deferred and current income taxes attributed to these items are also adjusted for considering their individual impact to the overall tax expense, deductibility and jurisdictional tax rates.
non-gaap information is intended to portray the results of our baseline performance, supplement or enhance management, analysts and investors' overall understanding of our underlying financial performance and facilitate comparisons among current, past and future periods. for example, non-gaap earnings and eps information is an indication of our baseline performance before items that are considered by us to not be reflective of our ongoing results. in addition, this information is among the primary indicators we use as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets and planning and forecasting for future periods. this information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings or diluted eps prepared in accordance with gaap.

cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held in the u.s. were approximately $9.3 billion at december 31, 2018. most of the remaining $1.4 billion is held primarily in our international affiliates for local operating needs. we are subject to a one-time deemed repatriation transition tax in which $2.1 billion will be payable over the next eight years as a result of u.s. tax reform. we expect to have more flexibility in accessing cash and future cash that may be generated in foreign subsidiaries. we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities together with cash generated from operations and issuance of commercial paper in the u.s. will be sufficient to satisfy our normal cash requirements for at least the next few years, including dividends, capital expenditures, milestone payments, working capital, deemed repatriation transition tax and $1.3 billion of debt maturing in 2019.
management continuously evaluates the company's capital structure to ensure the company is financed efficiently, which may result in the repurchase of common stock and debt securities, termination of interest rate swap contracts prior to maturity and issuance of debt securities. the average amount of commercial paper outstanding was $19 million at a weighted-average rate of 1.27% during 2018. the maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding was $300 million with no outstanding borrowings at december 31, 2018.
dividend payments were $2.6 billion in 2018 and 2017 and $2.5 billion in 2016. dividend decisions are made on a quarterly basis by our board of directors. annual capital expenditures were approximately $1.0 billion in 2018, $1.1 billion in 2017 and $1.2 billion in 2016 and are expected to be approximately $800 million in 2019 and $600 million in 2020. we continue to expand our biologics manufacturing capabilities and other facility-related activities. for example, we constructed a new large-scale biologics manufacturing facility in ireland that will produce multiple therapies for our growing biologics portfolio when approved for commercial use in early 2020. we also paid $1.85 billion to nektar in 2018 for certain collaboration rights and 8.3 million shares of its common stock representing a 4.8% ownership interest.
our investment portfolio includes non-current marketable securities, which are subject to changes in fair value as a result of interest rate fluctuations and other market factors. our investment policy establishes limits on the amount and time to maturity of investments with any institution. the policy also requires that investments are only entered into with corporate and financial institutions that meet high credit quality standards. refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 9. financial instruments and fair value measurements" for further information.
as of december 31, 2018, we had three revolving credit facilities totaling $5.0 billion, which consisted of a 364-day $2.0 billion facility that was scheduled to expire in march 2019 and two five-year $1.5 billion facilities that were extended to september 2022 and july 2023, respectively. all of these facilities provide for customary terms and conditions with no financial covenants and our two $1.5 billion revolving facilities are extendable annually by one year on the anniversary date with the consent of the lenders. no borrowings were outstanding under any of these revolving facilities as of december 31, 2018 or 2017.
in connection with our pending acquisition of celgene, in january 2019 we entered into a bridge commitment letter that provides for up to $33.5 billion in a 364-day senior unsecured bridge loan facility. we also entered into an $8 billion term loan credit agreement consisting of a $1 billion 364-day tranche, a $4 billion three-year tranche and a $3 billion five-year tranche. the term loan reduced the commitments under the bridge facility to $25.5 billion. if we obtain additional funding by issuing securities or obtaining other loans, the amount of the bridge facility will be correspondingly reduced. the bridge loan and the term loan are subject to customary terms and conditions and do not have any financial covenants. no amounts will be borrowed under either the bridge loan or the term loan prior to the closing of the pending acquisition of celgene.
in january 2019, we also entered into two new revolving credit facilities totaling $3.0 billion: a 364-day $2.0 billion facility expiring in january 2020 and a three-year $1.0 billion facility expiring in january 2022. the 364-day $2.0 billion facility replaced our existing 364-day $2.0 billion revolving facility, which was terminated concurrently upon the effectiveness of the new 364-day facility, and supports our commercial paper borrowings, if any. each of these facilities provide for customary terms and conditions with no financial covenants.
43
no borrowings were outstanding under these two revolving facilities or on our two $1.5 billion revolving facilities as of february 25, 2019.
following the announcement of our pending acquisition of celgene, we also entered into forward starting interest rate swap option contracts (swaptions), with a total notional value of $7.6 billion, to hedge future interest rate risk associated with the anticipated issuance of long-term debt to fund the acquisition. the swaptions provide us with the right to enter into forward starting interest rate swap contracts for periods of 10 and 30 years through january 2020.
additional regulations in the u.s. could be passed in the future including additional healthcare reform initiatives, further changes to tax laws, additional pricing laws and potential importation restrictions which may reduce our results of operations, operating cash flow, liquidity and financial flexibility. we continue to monitor the potential impact of the economic conditions in certain european and other countries and the related impact on prescription trends, pricing discounts and creditworthiness of our customers. we believe these economic conditions will not have a material impact on our liquidity, cash flow or financial flexibility.
the uk voted to depart from the eu during june 2016. similar to other companies in our industry, certain regulatory, trade, labor and other aspects of our business will likely be affected over time. however, we currently do not believe that these matters and other related financial effects will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. our sales in the uk represent less than 3% of our consolidated revenues.
credit ratings in january 2019, moody's placed bms under review for downgrade and standard & poor's placed bms on creditwatch with negative implications, each following the announcement to acquire celgene. bms's current long-term and short-term credit ratings assigned by moody's investors service are a2 and prime-1, respectively, and bms's current long-term and short-term credit ratings assigned by standard & poor's are a+ and a-1+, respectively. the long-term ratings reflect the agencies' opinion that we have a low default risk but are somewhat susceptible to adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions. the short-term ratings reflect the agencies' opinion that we have good to extremely strong capacity for timely repayment. any credit rating downgrade may affect the interest rate of any debt we may incur, the fair market value of existing debt and our ability to access the capital markets generally. the current long-term and short-term ratings do not reflect any impact from the proposed acquisition of celgene.
cash flows the following is a discussion of cash flow activities:

investing activities                        (874   )             (66   )           1,480

operating activities cash flow from operating activities represents the cash receipts and disbursements from all of our activities other than investing and financing activities. operating cash flow is derived by adjusting net earnings for noncontrolling interest, non-cash operating items, gains and losses attributed to investing and financing activities and changes in operating assets and liabilities resulting from timing differences between the receipts and payments of cash and when the transactions are recognized in our results of operations. as a result, changes in cash from operating activities reflect the timing of cash collections from customers and alliance partners; payments to suppliers, alliance partners and employees; customer discounts and rebates; and tax payments in the ordinary course of business. for example, annual employee bonuses are typically paid in the first quarter of the subsequent year. in addition, cash collections continue to be impacted by longer payment terms for certain biologic products in the u.s., primarily our newer oncology products including opdivo, yervoy and empliciti (90 days to 120 days). the longer payment terms are used to more closely align with the insurance reimbursement timing for physicians and cancer centers following administration to the patients.
44
the $700 million change in cash flow from operating activities compared to 2017 was primarily attributable to:
•   higher cash collections and timing of payments in the ordinary course of business of approximately $2.2 billion.
partially offset by:
•   higher r&amp;d licensing and collaboration payments of approximately $600 million primarily due to the nektar transaction in 2018;
•   lower litigation settlement proceeds of approximately $500 million primarily due to the merck settlement in 2017; and
•   lower out-license proceeds of approximately $400 million primarily due to the biogen and roche transactions in 2017.
the $2.2 billion change in cash flow from operating activities compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to:
•   higher cash collections and timing of payments in the ordinary course of business of approximately $400 million;
•   lower income tax payments of approximately $1.5 billion;
•   litigation settlement proceeds of approximately $500 million primarily due to the merck settlement; and
•   out-licensing proceeds of $500 million primarily due to the biogen and roche transactions.
partially offset by:
•   higher r&amp;d licensing payments of approximately $400 million primarily due to the cytomx, halozyme and nitto denko transactions; and
•   higher contributions to pension plans of approximately $300 million.
investing activities cash requirements from investing activities include cash used for acquisitions, manufacturing and facility-related capital expenditures and purchases of marketable securities with original maturities greater than 90 days at the time of purchase reduced by proceeds from business divestitures (including royalties) and the sale and maturity of marketable securities.
the $800 million change in cash flow from investing activities compared to 2017 was primarily attributable to:
•   lower net sales and maturities of marketable securities with maturities greater than 90 days of approximately $900 million; and
•   higher net acquisition and other payments of approximately $500 million primarily due to the purchase of 8.3 million shares of nektar common stock in 2018.
partially offset by:
•   higher business divestiture proceeds of approximately $500 million primarily due to the divestiture of manufacturing operations in swords, ireland and certain mature brands.
the $1.5 billion change in cash flow from investing activities compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to:
•   lower net sales of marketable securities with maturities greater than 90 days of approximately $700 million;
•   lower business divestiture proceeds of approximately $600 million primarily due to certain otc brands and investigational hiv medicines businesses in 2016; and
•   higher asset acquisition payments of approximately $300 million primarily due to the acquisition of ifm in 2017.
financing activities cash requirements from financing activities include cash used to pay dividends, repurchase common stock and repay long-term debt and other borrowings reduced by proceeds from the exercise of stock options and issuance of long-term debt and other borrowings.
the $500 million change in cash flow from financing activities compared to 2017 was primarily attributable to:
•   lower repurchases of common stock of $2.1 billion primarily due to the accelerated share repurchase agreements in 2017.
partially offset by:
•   lower net borrowings of $1.5 billion primarily due to the issuance of long-term debt used to repurchase common stock in 2017.
the $1.4 billion change in cash flow from financing activities compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to:
•   higher repurchase of common stock of $2.2 billion primarily due to the accelerated share repurchase agreements.
partially offset by:
•   higher net borrowing activity of $900 million primarily to fund the repurchase of common stock.

in addition to the above, we are committed to an aggregated $14.0 billion of potential future research and development milestone payments to third parties for in-licensing, asset acquisitions and development programs including early-stage milestones of $5.5 billion (milestones achieved through phase iii clinical studies) and late-stage milestones of $8.5 billion (milestones achieved post phase iii clinical studies). payments generally are due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental and regulatory milestones for which the specific timing cannot be predicted. some of these agreements also provide for sales-based milestones aggregating $4.4 billion that we would be obligated to pay to alliance partners upon achievement of certain sales levels in addition to royalties. we also have certain manufacturing, development and commercialization obligations in connection with alliance arrangements. it is not practicable to estimate the amount of these obligations. refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 3. alliances" for further information regarding our alliances. we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our financial condition or results of operations.
sec consent order / fcpa settlement as previously disclosed, on august 4, 2004, we entered into a final settlement with the sec, concluding an investigation concerning certain wholesaler inventory and accounting matters. the settlement was reached through a consent, a copy of which was attached as exhibit 10 to our quarterly report on form 10-q for the period ended september 30, 2004.
under the terms of the consent, we agreed, subject to certain defined exceptions, to limit sales of all products sold to our direct customers (including wholesalers, distributors, hospitals, retail outlets, pharmacies and government purchasers) based on expected demand or on amounts that do not exceed approximately one month of inventory on hand, without making a timely public disclosure of any change in practice. we also agreed in the consent to certain measures that we have implemented including: (a) establishing a formal review and certification process of our annual and quarterly reports filed with the sec; (b) establishing a business risk and disclosure group; (c) retaining an outside consultant to comprehensively study and help re-engineer our accounting and financial reporting processes; (d) publicly disclosing any sales incentives offered to direct customers for the purpose of inducing them to purchase products in excess of expected demand; and (e) ensuring that our budget process gives appropriate weight to inputs that come from the bottom to the top, and not just from the top to the bottom, and adequately documenting that process.
we have established a company-wide policy to limit our sales to direct customers for the purpose of complying with the consent. this policy includes the adoption of various procedures to monitor and limit sales to direct customers in accordance with the terms of the consent. these procedures include a governance process to escalate to appropriate management levels potential questions or concerns regarding compliance with the policy and timely resolution of such questions or concerns. in addition, compliance with the policy is monitored on a regular basis.

we maintain dsas with our u.s. pharmaceutical wholesalers, which account for nearly 100% of our gross u.s. revenues. under the current terms of the dsas, our wholesaler customers provide us with weekly information with respect to months on hand product-level inventories and the amount of out-movement of products. the three largest wholesalers currently account for approximately 97% of our gross u.s. revenues. the inventory information received from our wholesalers, together with our internal information, is used to estimate months on hand product level inventories at these wholesalers. we estimate months on hand product inventory levels for our u.s. business's wholesaler customers other than the three largest wholesalers by extrapolating from the months on hand calculated for the three largest wholesalers. in contrast, our non-u.s. business has significantly more direct customers, limited information on direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information, where available, varies widely. accordingly, we rely on a variety of methods to estimate months on hand product level inventories for these business units.
we believe the above-described procedures provide a reasonable basis to ensure compliance with the consent.
recently issued accounting standards for recently issued accounting standards, refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 1. accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards."
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. our critical accounting policies are those that significantly impact our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. because of this uncertainty, actual results may vary from these estimates.
revenue recognition our accounting policy for revenue recognition has a substantial impact on reported results and relies on certain estimates. revenue is recognized following a five-step model: (1) identify the customer contract; (2) identify the contract's performance obligation; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation; and (5) recognize revenue when or as a performance obligation is satisfied. revenue is also reduced for gtn sales adjustments discussed below, all of which involve significant estimates and judgment after considering legal interpretations of applicable laws and regulations, historical experience, payer channel mix (e.g. medicare or medicaid), current contract prices under applicable programs, unbilled claims and processing time lags and inventory levels in the distribution channel. estimates are assessed each period and adjusted as required to revise information or actual experience.
gtn adjustments the following categories of gtn adjustments involve significant estimates, judgments and information obtained from external sources. refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 2. revenue." for further discussion and analysis of each significant category of gtn sales adjustments.
charge-backs and cash discounts our u.s. business participates in programs with government entities, the most significant of which are the u.s. department of defense and the u.s. department of veterans affairs, and other parties, including covered entities under the 340b drug pricing program, whereby pricing on products is extended below wholesaler list price to participating entities. these entities purchase products through wholesalers at the lower program price and the wholesalers then charge us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower program price. accounts receivable is reduced for the estimated amount of unprocessed charge-back claims attributable to a sale (typically within a two to four week time lag).
in the u.s. and certain other countries, cash discounts are offered as an incentive for prompt payment, generally approximating 2% of the sales price. accounts receivable is reduced for the estimated amount of unprocessed cash discounts (typically within a one month time lag).
medicaid and medicare rebates our u.s. business participates in state government medicaid programs and other qualifying federal and state government programs requiring discounts and rebates to participating state and local government entities. all discounts and rebates provided through these programs are included in our medicaid rebate accrual. medicaid rebates have also been extended to drugs used in managed medicaid plans. the estimated amount of unpaid or unbilled rebates is presented as a liability.
47
rebates and discounts are offered to managed healthcare organizations in the u.s. managing prescription drug programs and medicare advantage prescription drug plans covering the medicare part d drug benefit. we also pay a 50% point of service discount to the cms when the medicare part d beneficiaries are in the coverage gap ("donut hole"). the estimated amount of unpaid or unbilled rebates and discounts is presented as a liability.
other rebates, returns, discounts and adjustments other gtn sales adjustments include sales returns and all other programs based on applicable laws and regulations for individual non-u.s. countries as well as rebates offered to managed healthcare organizations in the u.s. to a lesser extent. the non-u.s. programs include several different pricing schemes such as cost caps, volume discounts, outcome-based pricing schemes and pricing claw-backs that are based on sales of individual companies or an aggregation of all companies participating in a specific market. the estimated amount of unpaid or unbilled rebates and discounts is presented as a liability.
estimated returns for established products are determined after considering historical experience and other factors including levels of inventory in the distribution channel, estimated shelf life, product recalls, product discontinuances, price changes of competitive products, introductions of generic products, introductions of competitive new products and lower demand following the loe. estimated returns for new products are determined after considering historical sales return experience of similar products, such as those within the same product line, similar therapeutic area and/or similar distribution model and estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel and projected demand. the estimated amount for product returns is presented as a liability.
use of information from external sources information from external sources is used to estimate gtn adjustments. our estimate of inventory at the wholesalers are based on the projected prescription demand-based sales for our products and historical inventory experience, as well as our analysis of third-party information, including written and oral information obtained from certain wholesalers with respect to their inventory levels and sell-through to customers and third-party market research data, and our internal information. the inventory information received from wholesalers is a product of their recordkeeping process and excludes inventory held by intermediaries to whom they sell, such as retailers and hospitals.
we have also continued the practice of combining retail and mail prescription volume on a retail-equivalent basis. we use this methodology for internal demand forecasts. we also use information from external sources to identify prescription trends, patient demand and average selling prices. our estimates are subject to inherent limitations of estimates that rely on third-party information, as certain third-party information was itself in the form of estimates, and reflect other limitations including lags between the date as of which third-party information is generated and the date on which we receive third-party information.
pension benefits accounting for pension and postretirement benefit plans requires actuarial valuations based on significant assumptions for discount rates and expected long-term rates of return on plan assets. in consultation with our actuaries, these significant assumptions and others such as salary growth, retirement, turnover, lump sum election rates, healthcare trends and mortality rates are evaluated and selected based on expectations or actual experience during each remeasurement date. pension expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings, projected benefit obligations and future cash funding. actual results in any given year may differ from those estimated because of economic and other factors.
the yield on high quality corporate bonds that coincides with the cash flows of the plans' estimated payouts is used in determining the discount rate. the citi pension discount curve is used for the u.s. plans. the present value of benefit obligations at december 31, 2018 for the u.s. pension plans was determined using a 4.1% discount rate. if the assumed discount rate used in determining the u.s. pension plans' projected benefit obligation at december 31, 2018 was reduced by an additional 1%, the projected benefit obligation would increase by approximately $500 million.
the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is estimated considering expected returns for individual asset classes with input from external advisors. we also consider long-term historical returns including actual performance compared to benchmarks for similar investments. the bristol-myers squibb retirement income plan's pension expense for 2018 was determined using an average 6.6% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. other u.s. plans' pension expense was determined using a 7.8% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. if the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in determining the u.s. plans' pension expense for 2018 was reduced by 1%, such expense would increase by $42 million.

long-lived assets other intangible assets other intangible assets were $1.1 billion at december 31, 2018, including licenses ($192 million of which $84 million is allocated to unapproved products), developed technology rights ($501 million), capitalized software ($366 million) and iprd ($32 million). intangible assets are assessed for impairment whenever current facts or circumstances warrant a review, although iprd is assessed at least annually. intangible assets are highly vulnerable to impairment charges, particularly newly acquired assets for recently launched products or iprd. these assets are initially measured at fair value and therefore any reduction in expectations used in the valuations could potentially lead to impairment. some of the more common potential risks leading to impairment include competition, earlier than expected loe, pricing pressures, adverse regulatory changes or clinical study results, delay or failure to obtain regulatory approval and additional development costs, inability to achieve expected synergies, higher operating costs, changes in tax laws and other macro-economic changes. the complexity in estimating the fair value of intangible assets in connection with an impairment test is similar to the initial valuation.
property, plant and equipment property, plant and equipment is tested for impairment whenever current facts or circumstances require a review including whether it is more likely than not that the asset will be disposed of prior to its estimated remaining useful life. additionally, these long-lived assets are periodically reviewed to determine if any change in facts or circumstances would result in a change to the estimated useful life of the asset, possibly resulting in the acceleration of depreciation. if such circumstances exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists at its lowest level of identifiable cash flows. if an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset's fair value and its carrying value. expectations of future cash flows are subject to change based upon the near and long-term production volumes and margins generated by the asset as well as any potential alternative future use. accelerated depreciation, impairment and other related charges for certain manufacturing and r&d facilities were $137 million in 2018, $533 million in 2017 and $104 million in 2016. additional charges will continue to occur as a result of the company's restructuring actions announced in 2016.
assets held-for-sale the following criteria is considered before concluding assets are classified as held-for-sale; (1) management's commitment to a plan to sell, (2) availability for immediate sale in its present condition, (3) initiation of an active program to identify a buyer, (4) probability of a completed sale within one year, (5) actively marketed for sale at a reasonable price in relation to its current fair value, and (6) likelihood of significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. if all of the criteria is met as of the balance sheet date, the assets and liabilities are presented separately in the balance sheet as held-for-sale at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated or amortized while classified as held-for-sale. we have classified $479 million of assets and $152 million of liabilities as held-for-sale at december 31, 2018 which are related to the planned sale of the upsa consumer health business, a division of bms which manufactures and markets pain treatment and other otc products for domestic sale in france and export sales outside of france.
income taxes valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. the assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment including long-range forecasts of future taxable income and evaluation of tax planning initiatives. adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowances are made to earnings in the period when such assessments are made. our deferred tax assets were $2.1 billion at december 31, 2018 (net of valuation allowances of $3.2 billion) and $2.3 billion at december 31, 2017 (net of valuation allowances of $2.8 billion).
the u.s. federal net operating loss carryforwards were $206 million at december 31, 2018. these carryforwards were acquired as a result of certain acquisitions and are subject to limitations under section 382 of the internal revenue code. the net operating loss carryforwards expire in varying amounts beginning in 2022. the foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards expired in varying amounts beginning in 2018 (certain amounts have unlimited lives).
as discussed more fully in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 7. income taxes", a provisional tax charge of $2.6 billion attributable to the one-time deemed repatriation transition tax on certain foreign earnings was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017. the accounting for the reduction of deferred tax assets to the 21% tax rate was complete as of december 31, 2017, and the tax charge for the deemed repatriation transition tax is complete as of december 31, 2018. the provisional tax charge for the deemed repatriation transition tax was reduced by $56 million in 2018.

prior to the mead johnson split-off in 2009, the following transactions occurred: (i) an internal spin-off of mead johnson shares while still owned by us; (ii) conversion of mead johnson class b shares to class a shares; and (iii) conversion of mead johnson & company to a limited liability company. these transactions as well as the split-off of mead johnson through the exchange offer should qualify as tax-exempt transactions under the internal revenue code based upon a private letter ruling received from the internal revenue service related to the conversion of mead johnson class b shares to class a shares, and outside legal opinions.
certain assumptions, representations and covenants by mead johnson were relied upon regarding the future conduct of its business and other matters which could affect the tax treatment of the exchange. for example, the current tax law generally creates a presumption that the exchange would be taxable to us, if mead johnson or its shareholders were to engage in transactions that result in a 50% or greater change in its stock ownership during a four year period beginning two years before the exchange offer, unless it is established that the exchange offer were not part of a plan or series of related transactions to effect such a change in ownership. if the internal spin-off or exchange offer were determined not to qualify as a tax exempt transaction, the transaction could be subject to tax as if the exchange was a taxable sale by us at market value.
in addition, a negative basis or excess loss account (ela) existed in our investment in stock of mead johnson prior to these transactions. we received an opinion from outside legal counsel to the effect that it is more likely than not that we eliminated the ela as part of these transactions and do not have taxable income with respect to the ela. the tax law in this area is complex and it is possible that even if the internal spin-off and the exchange offer is tax exempt under the internal revenue code, the irs could assert that we have additional taxable income for the period with respect to the ela. we could be exposed to additional taxes if this were to occur. based upon our understanding of the internal revenue code and opinion from outside legal counsel, a tax reserve of $244 million was established reducing the gain on disposal of mead johnson included in discontinued operations in 2009.
we agreed to certain tax related indemnities with mead johnson as set forth in the tax sharing agreement, including certain taxes related to its business prior to the completion of the ipo and created as part of the restructuring to facilitate the ipo. mead johnson has also agreed to indemnify us for potential tax effects resulting from the breach of certain representations discussed above as well as certain transactions related to the acquisition of mead johnson's stock or assets.
liabilities are established for possible assessments by tax authorities resulting from known tax exposures including, but not limited to, transfer pricing matters, tax credits and deductibility of certain expenses. such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid and may need to be adjusted over time as more information becomes known.
for discussions on income taxes, refer to "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data-note 1. accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards-income taxes" and "-note 7. income taxes."
contingencies in the normal course of business, we are subject to contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, that cover a wide range of matters, including, among others, government investigations, shareholder lawsuits, product and environmental liability, contractual claims and tax matters. we recognize accruals for such contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. these estimates are subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict and, as such, actual results could vary from these estimates.

although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions, no assurance can be given that any goal or plan set forth in forward-looking statements can be achieved and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date made. additional risks that we may currently deem immaterial or that are not presently known to us could also cause the forward-looking events discussed in this 2018 form 10-k not to occur. except as otherwise required by federal securities law, we undertake no obligation to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise after the date of this 2018 form 10-k.

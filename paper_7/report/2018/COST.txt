item 7-management's discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations (amounts in millions, except per share, share, membership fee, and warehouse count data)
overview we believe that the most important driver of our profitability is sales growth, particularly comparable warehouse sales (comparable sales) growth. we define comparable sales as sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, as well as online sales related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year. comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations); and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions. the higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage certain of our selling, general and administrative expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long term. another substantial factor in sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the united states. sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations. while we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private label items, and through our online offerings.
our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. we do not focus in the short term on maximizing prices charged, but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our "pricing authority" on quality goods - consistently providing the most competitive values. our investments in merchandise pricing can, from time to time, include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting near-term gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage). we believe that our gasoline business draws members but it generally has a significantly lower gross margin percentage relative to our non-gasoline business. a higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-term net sales growth. generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expenses as a percentage of net sales. a decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect.
we also achieve sales growth by opening new warehouses. as our warehouse base grows, available and desirable potential sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. the negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations. our rate of square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. our e-commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales.
our membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability. this format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. the extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our executive members, and sustain high renewal rates, materially influences our profitability. our paid membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets.
21
our financial performance depends heavily on our ability to control costs. while we believe that we have achieved successes in this area, some significant costs are partially outside our control, most particularly health care and utility expenses. with respect to expenses relating to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. this may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. because our business is operated on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the income statement, particularly merchandise costs and selling, general and administrative expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income.
our operating model is generally the same across our u.s., canada, and other international operating segments (see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report). certain countries in the other international segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth, lower wages and benefits costs as a percentage of country sales, and/or less or no direct membership warehouse competition.
in discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar, which are references to the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into u.s. dollars for financial reporting purposes. this impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current period's currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period. the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current period's average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period.
our fiscal year ends on the sunday closest to august 31. fiscal year 2018 and 2016 were 52-week fiscal years ending on september 2, 2018 and august 28, 2016, respectively, and 2017 was a 53-week fiscal year ending on september 3, 2017. certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to costco.
highlights for fiscal year 2018 included:
•   we opened 25 new warehouses, including 4 relocations, in 2018: 13 net new locations in the u.s., three in canada, and five in our other international segment, compared to 28 new warehouses, including 2 relocations in 2017;
•   net sales increased 10% to 138,434 driven by a 9% increase in comparable sales and sales at new warehouses opened in 2017 and 2018, partially offset by one additional week of sales in 2017;
•   membership fee revenue increased 10% to $3,142, primarily due to the annual fee increase in the u.s. and canada in june 2017, and membership sign-ups at existing and new warehouses;
•   gross margin percentage decreased 29 basis points due to the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales and a shift in sales penetration to certain lower margin warehouse ancillary businesses from our core merchandise categories;
•   selling, general &amp; administrative (sg&amp;a) expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 24 basis points, due to the impact of gasoline price inflation and leveraging increased sales;
•   the effective tax rate in 2018 was 28.4% and was favorably impacted by the 2017 tax act and net tax benefits of $57. the effective tax rate in 2017 was 32.8% and was favorably impacted by net tax benefits of $104;
•   net income increased 17% to $3,134, or $7.09 per diluted share compared to $2,679, or $6.08 per diluted share in 2017; and
•   in april 2018, the board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.50 to $0.57 per share.

2018 vs. 2017
net sales net sales increased $12,262 or 10% during 2018, primarily due to a 9% increase in comparable sales and sales at new warehouses opened in 2017 and 2018, partially offset by the impact of one additional week of sales in 2017.
changes in gasoline prices positively impacted net sales by approximately $2,267, or 180 basis points, due to a 19% increase in the average sales price per gallon. changes in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar positively impacted net sales by approximately $1,156, or 92 basis points, compared to 2017. the positive impact was driven by both our canadian and other international operations.
comparable sales comparable sales increased 9% during 2018 and were positively impacted by increases in both shopping frequency and the average ticket. the average ticket and comparable sales results were positively impacted by an increase in gasoline prices and exchange rates in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar. changes in comparable sales includes the negative impact of cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations).
23
2017 vs. 2016
net sales net sales increased $10,099 or 9% during 2017, primarily due to a 4% increase in comparable sales, new warehouses opened in 2016 and 2017, and the benefit of one additional week of sales in 2017. changes in gasoline prices positively impacted net sales by approximately $785, or 68 basis points, due to an 8% increase in the average sales price per gallon. changes in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately $295, or 25 basis points, compared to 2016. the negative impact was driven by other international operations, partially offset by positive impacts attributable to our canadian operations.
comparable sales comparable sales increased 4% during 2017 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency and, to a lesser extent, an increased average ticket. the average ticket and comparable sales results were positively impacted by an increase in gasoline prices, offset by decreases in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar. changes in comparable sales includes the negative impact of cannibalization.

2018 vs. 2017
the increase in membership fees was primarily due to the annual fee increase and membership sign-ups at existing and new warehouses. these increases were partially offset by the impact of one additional week of membership fees in 2017. at the end of 2018, our member renewal rates were 90% in the u.s. and canada and 88% worldwide.
as reported in fiscal 2017, we increased our annual membership fees in the u.s. and canada and in certain of our other international operations. we account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, recognized ratably over the one-year membership period. these fee increases had a positive impact of approximately $178 in fiscal 2018 and will positively impact fiscal 2019, primarily the first two quarters, by approximately $70.
2017 vs. 2016
the increase in membership fees was primarily due to membership sign-ups at existing and new warehouses, an extra week of membership fee revenue, the annual fee increase, and an increased number of upgrades to our higher-fee executive membership program. fee increases had a positive impact on membership fee revenues during 2017 of approximately $23.

2018 vs. 2017
the gross margin of our core merchandise categories (food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods), when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), increased one basis point primarily due to increases in food and sundries and hardlines partially offset by decreases in fresh foods and softlines. this measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses.
total gross margin percentage decreased 29 basis points compared to 2017. excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales, gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 11.22%, a decrease of 11 basis points. this decrease was primarily due to a shift in sales penetration to certain lower margin warehouse ancillary and other businesses, which contributed to a 13 basis point decrease in our core merchandise categories, except hardlines which was flat. gross margin percentage was also negatively impacted by 10 basis points due to a non-recurring legal settlement benefiting 2017 and costs related to our centralized return centers in the u.s. these decreases were partially offset by a 13 basis point increase in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, predominantly our gasoline business. changes in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar positively impacted gross margin by approximately $124 in 2018.
the segment gross margin percentage, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales (segment gross margin percentage), decreased in our u.s. operations, predominantly in our core merchandise categories, and as a result of the non-recurring legal settlement in 2017, and the costs related to our centralized return centers mentioned above. the segment gross margin percentage in our canadian operations increased, due to warehouse ancillary and other businesses, primarily our gasoline business. the segment gross margin percentage in our other international operations decreased, predominantly in food and sundries and softlines, partially offset by an increase in our gasoline business.
2017 vs. 2016
the gross margin of our core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales, increased eight basis points due to increases in these categories other than fresh foods.
total gross margin percentage decreased two basis points compared to 2016. excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales, gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 11.40%, an increase of five basis points. this increase was primarily due to amounts earned under the co-branded credit card arrangement in the u.s. of 15 basis points and a benefit of three basis points from non-recurring legal settlements and other matters. the improvement in terms in our current co-brand agreement as compared to the prior co-brand arrangement led to substantial year over year benefits in fiscal 2017. these increases were partially offset by a six basis point decrease in our core merchandise categories, primarily due to food and sundries as a result of a decrease in sales penetration. the gross margin percentage was also negatively impacted by five basis points due to a lifo benefit in 2016 and one basis point in warehouse ancillary and other businesses. changes in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar had an immaterial impact on gross margin in 2017.

sg&a expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 24 basis points compared to 2017. excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales, sg&a expenses as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 10.19%, a decrease of seven basis points. operating costs related to warehouses, ancillary, and other businesses, which includes e-commerce and travel, were lower by six basis points, predominantly in our u.s. and other international operations, due to leveraging increased sales. charges related to certain non-recurring legal and other matters in 2017 positively impacted sg&a expense by two basis points. stock compensation expense was also lower by one basis point. central operating costs were higher by two basis points. changes in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar increased our sg&a expenses by approximately $98 in 2018.
effective in june 2018, a portion of the savings generated from the tax cuts and jobs act (the "2017 tax act") were used to increase wages for the majority of our u.s. hourly employees. the impact in fiscal 2018 was two basis points and the estimated annualized pre-tax cost of these increases is approximately $120.
2017 vs. 2016
sg&a expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 14 basis points compared to 2016. excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales, sg&a expenses as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 10.33%, a decrease of seven basis points. operating costs related to warehouses, ancillary, and other businesses, were lower by nine basis points, primarily due to lower costs associated with the co-branded credit card arrangement in the u.s. of 18 basis points. the improvement in terms in our current co-brand agreement as compared to the prior co-brand arrangement led to substantial year over year benefits in fiscal 2017. this was partially offset by higher payroll and employee benefit expenses of 11 basis points, primarily in our u.s. operations. central operating costs were higher by one basis point, primarily due to increased costs associated with our information systems modernization, including increased depreciation for projects placed in service, incurred by our u.s. operations. stock compensation expense was also higher by one basis point.

2018 vs. 2017
the increase in interest income in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to higher interest rates earned on higher average cash and investment balances. foreign-currency transaction gains (losses), net include the revaluation or settlement of monetary assets and liabilities and mark-to-market adjustments for forward foreign-exchange contracts by our canadian and other international operations. in 2018, the increase was primarily due to a strengthening u.s. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies on forward foreign-exchange contracts. see derivatives and foreign currency sections in item 8, note 1 of this report.

provision for income taxes
2018                                                      2017                2016
provision for income taxes      $1,263              $1,325              $1,243
effective tax rate                28.4   %            32.8   %            34.3   %
our effective tax rate for 2018 was favorably impacted by the 2017 tax act, which included a reduction in the u.s. federal corporate rate from 35% to 21%. due to the timing of our fiscal year relative to the effective date of the rate change, our u.s. corporate rate for 2018 resulted in a blended rate of 25.6%. other impacts from the 2017 tax act consisted of tax expense of $142 for the estimated tax on deemed repatriation of unremitted earnings and $43 for the reduction in foreign tax credits and other immaterial items, largely offset by a tax benefit of $166 for the provisional remeasurement of certain deferred tax liabilities. in 2018, we also recognized net tax benefits of $76, which was largely driven by the adoption of an accounting standard related to stock-based compensation and other immaterial net benefits.
in 2017, our provision was favorably impacted by net tax benefits of $104, primarily due to a tax benefit recorded in connection with the may 2017 special dividend paid to employees through our 401(k) retirement plan of $82. this dividend was deductible for u.s. income tax purposes.
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes our significant sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents:
2018                                                        2017                2016
net cash provided by operating activities      $5,774              $6,726              $3,292
net cash used in investing activities          (2,947   )          (2,366   )          (2,345   )
net cash used in financing activities          (1,281   )          (3,218   )          (2,419   )
our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations, cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $7,259 and $5,779 at the end of 2018 and 2017, respectively. of these balances, approximately $1,348 and $1,255 represented unsettled credit and debit card receivables, respectively. these receivables generally settle within four days. cash and cash equivalents were negatively impacted by a change in exchange rates of $37 in 2018 and positively impacted by $25 and $50 in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
management believes that our cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. while we believe that our u.s. current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet our u.s. liquidity requirements, beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we no longer consider current fiscal year and future earnings of our non-u.s. consolidated subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested. we recorded the estimated incremental foreign withholding (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable on current fiscal year earnings assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the u.s. we continue to consider undistributed earnings of certain non-u.s. consolidated subsidiaries prior to fiscal 2018 to be indefinitely reinvested and have not provided for withholding or state taxes.
in fiscal 2018, we recorded a one-time charge of $142 for the estimated tax on deemed repatriation of unremitted earnings under the 2017 tax act. the 2017 tax act provides for the payment of the federal tax over an eight-year period. because of the availability of foreign tax credits, the amount payable is $97, of which $89 is classified as long-term and included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.
cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities totaled $5,774 in 2018, compared to $6,726 in 2017. our cash flow provided by operations is primarily derived from net sales and membership fees. cash flow used in operations
28
generally consists of payments to our merchandise vendors, warehouse operating costs including payroll and employee benefits, utilities, and credit and debit card processing fees. cash used in operations also includes payments for income taxes. the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for 2018 when compared to 2017 was primarily due to accelerated vendor payments of approximately $1,700 made in the last week of fiscal 2016, which positively impacted cash flows in 2017.
cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities totaled $2,947 in 2018, compared to $2,366 in 2017, and primarily related to capital expenditures. net cash flows from investing activities also includes maturities and purchases of short-term investments.
capital expenditures we opened 21 net new warehouses and relocated 4 warehouses in 2018 and plan to open approximately 20 net new warehouses and relocate up to 4 warehouses in 2019. our primary requirement for capital is acquiring land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses. capital is also required for information systems, manufacturing and distribution facilities, initial warehouse operations and working capital. in 2018, we spent $2,969 on capital expenditures, and it is our current intention to spend approximately $2,800 to $3,100 during fiscal 2019. these expenditures are expected to be financed with cash from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs.
cash flows from financing activities net cash used in financing activities totaled $1,281 in 2018, compared to $3,218 in 2017. the primary uses of cash in 2018 were related to dividend payments and repurchases of common stock. net cash used in financing activities in 2017 primarily related to dividend payments, predominantly the special dividend paid in may 2017, and the repayments of debt totaling $2,200 representing the aggregate principal balances of the 5.5% and 1.125% senior notes.
in may 2017, we issued $3,800 in aggregate principal amount of senior notes. the proceeds received were net of a discount and used to pay the special dividend and a portion of the redemption of the 1.125% senior notes.
stock repurchase programs during 2018 and 2017, we repurchased 1,756,000 and 2,998,000 shares of common stock, at average prices of $183.13 and $157.87, totaling approximately $322 and $473, respectively. the remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $2,427 at the end of 2018. these amounts may differ from the stock repurchase balances in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchases at the end of each fiscal year. purchases are made from time-to-time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under sec rule 10b5-1. repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the washington business corporation act.
dividends cash dividends declared in 2018 totaled $2.14 per share, as compared to $8.90 per share in 2017, which included a special cash dividend of $7.00 per share. in april 2018, our board of directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.50 to $0.57 per share. subsequent to the end of 2018, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.57 per share, which is payable on november 23, 2018.
29
bank credit facilities and commercial paper programs we maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. at september 2, 2018, we had borrowing capacity under these facilities of $857, including a $400 revolving line of credit renewed by the u.s., which expires in june 2019. the company currently has no plans to draw upon this facility. our international operations maintain $344 of the total borrowing capacity under bank credit facilities, of which $163 is guaranteed by the company. there were no outstanding short-term borrowings under the bank credit facilities at the end of 2018 and 2017.
the company has letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $220. the outstanding standby letters of credit under these facilities at the end of 2018 totaled $149 and expire within one year. the bank credit facilities and commercial paper programs have various expiration dates, all within one year, and we generally intend to renew these facilities. the amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit then outstanding.
contractual obligations at september 2, 2018, our commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows:
payments due by fiscal year contractual obligations                                            2019             2020 to 2021             2022 to 2023            2024 and thereafter               total purchase obligations (merchandise)(1)                        $9,029                    $2                       $-                           $-                   $9,031

off-balance sheet arrangements in the opinion of management, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or financial statements other than operating leases, included in the table above and discussed in note 1 and note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report.

critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap) requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, and we continue to review and evaluate these estimates. for further information on significant accounting policies, see discussion in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report.
insurance/self-insurance liabilities the company is predominantly self-insured for employee health-care benefits, workers' compensation, general liability, property damage, directors' and officers' liability, vehicle liability, and inventory loss. insurance coverage is maintained in certain instances to limit the exposure arising from catastrophic events. we use different mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and participate in a reinsurance program. liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated by using historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. the costs of claims are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate as a result of inflation rates, regulatory or legal changes, and unforeseen developments in claims of an extended nature. while we believe our estimates are reasonable and provide for a certain degree of coverage to account for these variables, actual claims and costs could differ significantly from recorded liabilities. historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material.
income taxes the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. significant judgment also is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. the benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. when facts and circumstances change, we reassess these positions and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. in december 2017, the 2017 tax act was signed into law and our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 reflects the provisional impact (see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements).

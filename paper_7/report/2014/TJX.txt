item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion that follows relates to our 52-week fiscal years ended january 31, 2015 (fiscal 2015) and february 1, 2014 (fiscal 2014) and our 53-week fiscal year ended february 2, 2013 (fiscal 2013).
overview we are the leading off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in the u.s. and worldwide. we sell a rapidly changing assortment of apparel, home fashions and other merchandise at prices generally 20% to 60% below department and specialty store regular prices on comparable merchandise, every day. we operate over 3,300 stores through our four main segments: in the u.s., marmaxx (which operates t.j. maxx, marshalls and tjmaxx.com) and homegoods; tjx canada (which operates winners, homesense and marshalls in canada); and tjx europe (which operates t.k. maxx, homesense and tkmaxx.com in europe). we also operate sierra trading post (stp), a leading off-price internet retailer that we acquired in late fiscal 2013, which operates sierratradingpost.com and six stores in the u.s. the results of stp have been reported with the marmaxx segment.
fiscal 2015 was another successful year for tjx as we posted solid gains in net sales and earnings per share on top of strong increases in both fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013. we continued to generate strong cash flows, allowing us to return value to our shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, while continuing to reinvest in our business by adding new stores, remodeling existing ones and strengthening our infrastructure to support our next level of growth. in fiscal 2016, we announced an initiative to raise wages for our u.s. full- and part-time hourly store associates to at least $9.00 per hour beginning in june 2015.
highlights of our financial performance for fiscal 2015 include the following:
   same store sales increased 2% in fiscal 2015 over an increase of 3% in fiscal 2014 and an increase of 7% in fiscal 2013. the fiscal 2015 increase was driven by increases in the value of the average transaction and in customer traffic.
    net sales increased to $29.1 billion for fiscal 2015, up 6% over the same period last year. net sales increased to $27.4 billion for fiscal 2014, up 6% over the
53-week fiscal period in fiscal 2013. at january 31, 2015, the number of stores in operation and selling square footage increased 5% over the end of fiscal 2014.
                         earnings per share for fiscal 2015 were $3.15 per diluted share compared to $2.94 per diluted share in fiscal 2014. fiscal 2015 earnings per share reflect a charge of $0.01 from a loss on early extinguishment of debt. diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2014 included an $0.11 per share benefit resulting from tax benefits recognized in the third quarter.
   our fiscal 2015 pre-tax margin (the ratio of pre-tax income to net sales) was 12.2%, a 0.1 percentage point increase compared to our fiscal 2014 pre-tax margin.
the loss on early extinguishment of debt reduced pre-tax margin by 0.1 percentage point in fiscal 2015.
   our cost of sales ratio for fiscal 2015 was 71.5%, flat compared to the fiscal 2014 ratio. merchandise margins were slightly up in fiscal 2015.
   our selling, general and administrative expense ratio for fiscal 2015 decreased 0.2 percentage points from 16.3% in fiscal 2014 to 16.1%.
   our consolidated average per store inventories, including inventory on hand at our distribution centers (which excludes inventory in transit) and excluding our e-commerce businesses, were up 3% at the end of fiscal 2015.
   during fiscal 2015, we repurchased 27.7 million shares of our common stock for $1.7 billion. earnings per share reflect the benefit of the stock repurchase program. in january 2015, our board of directors authorized our 16th stock repurchase program for an additional $2 billion.

the following is a discussion of our consolidated operating results, followed by a discussion of our segment operating results.
net sales: consolidated net sales for fiscal 2015 totaled $29.1 billion, a 6% increase over $27.4 billion in fiscal 2014. the increase reflected a 4% increase from new stores and a 2% increase from same store sales. foreign currency exchange rates and e-commerce sales had an immaterial impact on fiscal 2015 net sales growth. consolidated net sales for fiscal 2014 totaled $27.4 billion, a 6% increase over $25.9 billion in fiscal 2013. the increase reflected a 4% increase from new stores, a 3% increase from same store sales and a 1% increase from stp, offset by a 2% decrease attributable to the 53rd week included in fiscal 2013. foreign currency exchange rates had an immaterial impact on fiscal 2014 net sales.
same store sales increases in the u.s. for fiscal 2015 were driven by increases in the value of the average transaction and customer traffic. in fiscal 2015, within apparel, sales from jewelry and accessories and activewear performed particularly well, as did home fashions. geographically, in the u.s., sales were strongest in the southeast and southwest. same store sales increases at tjx europe and tjx canada were above the consolidated average.
same store sales increases in the u.s. for fiscal 2014 were driven by an increase in average ticket as well as a slight increase in customer traffic. we believe unfavorable weather in many regions where we operate had a negative impact on sales during the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2014. sales from jewelry and accessories, and home fashions performed particularly well in fiscal 2014. geographically, same store sales increases in the u.s. were strongest in the west coast and florida. same store sales increases at tjx europe were above the consolidated average while tjx canada was below the consolidated average.
we define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years, or in other words, stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation. the sales of sierra trading post, tjmaxx.com and tkmaxx.com are not included in same store sales. we classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store sales criteria. we determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year, unless a store is closed. we calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned. relocated stores and stores that have increased in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store, and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated same store percentage is immaterial. same store sales of our foreign segments are calculated on a constant currency basis, meaning we translate the current year's same store sales of our foreign segments at the same exchange rates used in the prior year. this removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, which we believe is a more accurate measure of segment operating performance. we define customer traffic to be the number of transactions in stores included in the same store sales calculation and define average ticket to be the average retail price of the units sold. we define average transaction or average basket to be the average dollar value of transactions included in the same store sales calculation.

impact of foreign currency exchange rates: our operating results are affected by foreign currency exchange rates as a result of changes in the value of the u.s. dollar in relation to other currencies. two ways in which foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results are as follows:
                                                    translation of foreign operating results into u.s. dollars: in our financial statements, we translate the operations of tjx canada and tjx europe from local currencies into u.s. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time. significant changes in foreign exchange rates between comparable prior periods can result in meaningful variations in consolidated net sales, net income and earnings per share growth as well as the net sales and operating results of these segments. currency translation generally does not affect operating margins as a percentage of net sales, or affects them only slightly, as sales and expenses of the foreign operations are translated at essentially the same rates within a given period.
                                                   inventory-related derivatives: we routinely enter into inventory-related hedging instruments to mitigate the impact on earnings of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise purchases denominated in currencies other than the local currencies of our divisions, principally tjx canada and tjx europe. as we have not elected "hedge accounting" for these instruments as defined by u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap), we record a mark-to-market gain or loss on the derivative instruments in our results of operations at the end of each reporting period. in subsequent periods, the income statement impact of the mark-to-market adjustment is effectively offset when the inventory being hedged is received and paid for. while these effects occur every reporting period, they are of much greater magnitude when there are sudden and significant changes in currency exchange rates during a short period of time. the mark-to-market adjustment on these derivatives does not affect net sales, but it does affect the cost of sales, operating margins and earnings we report.
we discuss the effect of these foreign currency issues on our actual results throughout this discussion. as a result of the strengthening of the u.s. dollar and resulting change in foreign currency exchange rates in late fiscal 2015, if rates were to stay at or near those levels in the coming year, we expect fiscal 2016 results would be negatively impacted to a much greater extent than historically experienced.
cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs: cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, as a percentage of net sales remained flat at 71.5% in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014, and was 71.6% in fiscal 2013. there was a slight increase in merchandise margins in fiscal 2015.
the 53rd week in fiscal 2013, which benefitted that year's expense ratio by approximately 0.2 percentage points, impacts year-over-year comparisons. the 0.1 percentage point improvement in this ratio for fiscal 2014 was primarily due to slight expense leverage in buying and occupancy costs, as merchandise margins were comparable to the prior year.
26
selling, general and administrative expenses: selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 16.1% in fiscal 2015, 16.3% in fiscal 2014 and 16.4% in fiscal 2013. the reduction in this ratio is largely due to a reduction in our reserves for former operations in fiscal 2015, as well as costs incurred in fiscal 2014 relating to our home office relocations.
the improvement in this ratio for fiscal 2014 was primarily due to year-over-year favorability from a combination of items that negatively impacted the fiscal 2013 expense ratio. fiscal 2013 included a non-cash charge for the cumulative impact of a correction to our pension accrual, a non-operating charge due to the adjustment in our reserve for former operations relating to closed stores and contributions to the tjx foundation.
loss on early extinguishment of debt: on july 8, 2014, we redeemed our $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.20% notes due august 2015 and recorded a pre-tax loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $16.8 million.
interest expense, net: the components of interest expense, net for the last three fiscal years are summarized below:

interest expense, net   $39,787                   $31,081                   $29,175
the increase in net interest expense for fiscal 2015 reflected the interest cost from the date of issuance (june 5, 2014) on the $750 million 2.75% seven-year notes. in addition, fiscal 2015 included 12 months of interest expense on the $500 million 2.50% ten-year notes, compared to fiscal 2014, which only reflected nine months of interest expense. these costs were partially offset by interest savings due to the redemption of the $400 million 4.20% notes. the reduction in capitalized interest on ongoing capital projects is partially offset by an increase in interest income driven by higher cash balances.
income taxes: our effective annual income tax rate was 37.6% in fiscal 2015, 35.6% in fiscal 2014 and 38.0% in fiscal 2013. the increase in the fiscal 2015 effective income tax rate, as compared to fiscal 2014, was primarily due to the impact on the fiscal 2014 income tax rate from tax benefits in fiscal 2014 of approximately $80 million, which were primarily due to a reduction in our reserve for uncertain tax positions as a result of settlements with state taxing authorities and the reversal of valuation allowances against foreign net operating loss carryforwards. these benefits reduced the fiscal 2014 effective income tax rate by 1.4 percentage points and 0.8 percentage points, respectively. the decrease in the fiscal 2014 effective income tax rate as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to the tax benefits described above. see note l to the consolidated financial statements for more information relating to income taxes.
net income and diluted earnings per share: net income was $2.2 billion in fiscal 2015, a 4% increase over $2.1 billion in fiscal 2014, which in turn was a 12% increase over $1.9 billion in fiscal 2013. diluted earnings per share were $3.15 in fiscal 2015, $2.94 in fiscal 2014 and $2.55 in fiscal 2013. the after-tax cost for the loss on the early extinguishment of debt in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 reduced earnings per share for fiscal 2015 by $0.01 per share. the tax benefits referred to above added $0.11 per share to net income for fiscal 2014, while the 53rd week benefited fiscal 2013 earnings per share by $0.08 per share. foreign currency exchange rates also affected the comparability of our results. foreign currency exchange rates had a $0.01 negative impact on earnings per share for both fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013.
our stock repurchase programs, which reduce our weighted average diluted shares outstanding, benefited our earnings per share growth in fiscal 2015 by 4%. we repurchased 27.7 million shares of our stock at a cost of $1.7 billion in fiscal 2015, 27.0 million shares of our stock at a cost of $1.5 billion in fiscal 2014 and 30.6 million shares of our stock at a cost of $1.3 billion in fiscal 2013.

segment information: we operate four main business segments. our marmaxx (t.j. maxx, marshalls and tjmaxx.com) and homegoods segments both operate in the united states. our tjx canada segment operates winners, homesense and marshalls in canada, and our tjx europe segment operates t.k. maxx, homesense and tkmaxx.com in europe. we also operate stp, an off-price internet retailer with a small number of stores in the u.s. the results of stp have been included with our marmaxx segment. we evaluate the performance of our segments based on "segment profit or loss," which we define as pre-tax income or loss before general corporate expense, loss on early extinguishment of debt and interest expense. "segment profit or loss," as we define the term, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. the terms "segment margin" or "segment profit margin" are used to describe segment profit or loss as a percentage of net sales. these measures of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity.

at january 31, 2015, stp operated six stores with a selling square footage of 122,000. at february 1, 2014 and february 2, 2013, stp operated four stores with a selling square footage of 83,000.
net sales at marmaxx increased 4% in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. the increase reflected a 3% increase from new stores and a 1% increase from same store sales. the same store sales increase of 1% in fiscal 2015 is on top of a 3% increase in the prior year. same store sales growth at marmaxx for fiscal 2015 was driven by an increase in the average transaction with a slight increase in customer traffic. same store sales increases for home fashions were above the chain average while apparel overall was below the chain average. within apparel, jewelry and accessories and activewear were well above the average. geographically, same store sales increases were strongest in the southeast and southwest.
same store sales for marmaxx were up 3% in fiscal 2014, on top of a 6% increase in the prior year. same store sales growth at marmaxx for fiscal 2014 was driven by an increase in average ticket. we believe severe winter weather in many regions of the country, particularly in the fourth quarter, impacted our sales in fiscal 2014. same store sales were above the chain average for home fashions, and while apparel overall was below the chain average, within apparel, jewelry and accessories were well above the average. geographically, same store sales were strongest in the west coast and florida. in addition, in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 we launched our e-commerce site, tjmaxx.com.
segment margin in fiscal 2015 was 14.6%, flat compared to fiscal 2014. improvements in merchandise margin as well as a reduction in administrative costs and insurance costs as a percentage of sales were offset by the impact of our e-commerce businesses and expense deleverage, primarily occupancy costs, on the 1% same store sales growth.
28
segment margin in fiscal 2014 was 14.6%, flat compared to fiscal 2013. the 53rd week increased the fiscal 2013 segment margin by approximately 0.2 percentage points. excluding the extra week in fiscal 2013, the improvement in segment margin was primarily due to an increase in merchandise margin for fiscal 2014, despite higher markdowns taken in the fourth quarter. fiscal 2014 segment margin was reduced by 0.2 percentage points due to the impact of our e-commerce businesses but this decline in margin was largely offset by the benefit of some expense leverage and reduced incentive compensation costs as compared to the prior year.
in fiscal 2016, we expect to open approximately 70 new marmaxx stores (net of closings) and increase selling square footage by approximately 3%.

homegoods' net sales increased 14% in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014, on top of a 13% increase in fiscal 2014 when compared to fiscal 2013. the increase in fiscal 2015 reflected a 7% increase from new stores and a 7% increase from same store sales. the same store sales increase of 7% in fiscal 2015 is on top of a same store sales increase of 7% in fiscal 2014. same store sales growth in both fiscal 2015 and 2014 was driven by an increase in the value of the average transaction along with an increase in customer traffic.
segment profit margin for fiscal 2015 was 13.6%, up from 12.9% for fiscal 2014. the increase was driven by expense leverage on the 7% same store sales increase, (primarily buying and occupancy costs, and administrative costs,) as well as an increase in merchandise margins. segment profit margin for fiscal 2014 was 12.9%, up from 12.2% for fiscal 2013. the increase in fiscal 2014 was driven by expense leverage on the 7% same store sales increase, particularly buying and occupancy costs. the 53rd week increased the fiscal 2013 segment margin by approximately 0.2 percentage points.
in fiscal 2016, we plan a net increase of 40 homegoods stores and plan to increase selling square footage by approximately 8%.

net sales for tjx canada in fiscal 2015 were essentially flat compared to fiscal 2014. while net sales reflected a 4% increase from new stores and a 3% increase from same store sales, these were offset by currency translation that negatively impacted sales growth by 7%. the same store sales increase of 3% in fiscal 2015 was driven by an increase in the value of the average transaction along with an increase in customer traffic. same store sales were flat in fiscal 2014. net sales for tjx canada decreased 2% in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. currency translation negatively impacted sales growth by 4 percentage points in fiscal 2014, as compared to the same period in the prior year. same store sales increased 5% in fiscal 2013.
segment profit margin decreased 0.5 percentage points to 13.6% in fiscal 2015. the decrease in segment margin was due to a decrease in merchandise margins and the unfavorable impact of mark-to-market adjustment on inventory-related derivatives, which collectively reduced segment margin by 0.8 percentage points. the decrease in merchandise margin was driven by changes in currency exchange rates which increased tjx canada's cost of merchandise purchased in u.s. dollars. we expect this increase in the cost of merchandise purchased with u.s. dollars will likely continue into fiscal 2016 based on the recent trend in currency exchange rates. the decline in the fiscal 2015 segment margin was partially offset by expense leverage on same store sales, particularly buying and occupancy costs, along with a reduction in advertising costs as a percentage of sales.
segment profit margin decreased 0.1 percentage points to 14.1% in fiscal 2014. the decrease in segment margin was due to expense deleverage on the flat same store sales, particularly occupancy and administrative costs and the absence of the 53rd week which benefited fiscal 2013 segment margin by 0.2 percentage points. these factors more than offset the year-over-year favorable impact of the mark-to-market adjustment on inventory-related derivatives of $14 million and an increase in merchandise margin.
in fiscal 2016, we plan a net increase of approximately 20 stores in canada and plan to increase selling square footage by approximately 4%.

net sales for tjx europe increased 13% in fiscal 2015 to $4.1 billion compared to $3.6 billion in fiscal 2014 on top of a 10% increase in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. the increase in fiscal 2015 reflected an 8% increase from new store sales, 3% from same store sales and a 2% favorable impact from currency translation. the fiscal 2015 same store sales increase of 3% compares to an increase of 6% in fiscal 2014 and a 10% increase in fiscal 2013. the increase in same store sales for fiscal 2015 was driven by an increase in the value of the average transaction along with an increase in customer traffic. net sales for tjx europe increased 10% in fiscal 2014 to $3.6 billion compared to $3.3 billion in fiscal 2013. currency translation had an immaterial impact on fiscal 2014 sales growth.
segment profit increased 22% to $337.4 million for fiscal 2015, and segment profit margin increased to 8.2% compared to 7.6% in fiscal 2014. the improvement in segment margin was primarily due to an increase in merchandise margins and expense leverage on same store sales, particularly buying and occupancy costs. the increase in segment margin was also largely due to the positive impact of the mark-to-market adjustment on inventory-related derivatives. these margin improvements were partially offset by an increase in store payroll costs as a percentage of sales as well as investments in talent and research to open stores in two new countries in fiscal 2016.
segment profit increased 28% to $275.5 million for fiscal 2014, and segment margin increased to 7.6%. the improvement in segment margin was due primarily to expense leverage on strong same store sales, particularly buying and occupancy costs and a lower incentive compensation accrual. the mark-to-market adjustment on inventory-related derivatives had a negative impact of 0.3 percentage points and the 53rd week in fiscal 2013 had a negative impact of 0.2 percentage points on the year-over-year comparison of segment margin for fiscal 2014.
we expect to add approximately 50 stores (net of closings) in europe in fiscal 2015 and plan to increase selling square footage by approximately 10%.

general corporate expense   $324.4                  $329.5                  $335.0
general corporate expense for segment reporting purposes represents those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments. virtually all general corporate expenses are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. overall general corporate expense in fiscal 2015 decreased slightly from the prior year. this decrease reflects a favorable adjustment to our reserve for former operations in fiscal 2015 as well as
31
costs incurred in fiscal 2014 relating to our home office relocations. these reductions in general corporate expense were partially offset by an increase in stock compensation expense and higher contributions to the tjx foundation.
general corporate expense for fiscal 2014 decreased slightly from the prior year primarily due to the absence in fiscal 2014 of approximately $56 million of costs incurred in fiscal 2013. fiscal 2013 included contributions to the tjx foundation, an adjustment to our reserve for former operations and the acquisition costs of stp. this decline in general corporate expense was largely offset by increases in systems and technology costs, stock compensation and costs relating to our home office relocations.
liquidity and capital resources operating activities: net cash provided by operating activities was $3,008 million in fiscal 2015, $2,600 million in fiscal 2014 and $3,056 million in fiscal 2013. the cash generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal years was largely due to operating earnings.
operating cash flows for fiscal 2015 increased $408 million compared to fiscal 2014. net income plus the non-cash impact of depreciation provided cash of $2,804 million in fiscal 2015 compared to $2,686 million in fiscal 2014, an increase of $118 million. the change in the deferred income tax provision, which was driven by the tax treatment of the voluntary contributions to our funded pension plan of $150 million in fiscal 2015, favorably impacted fiscal 2015 operating cash flows by $50 million. the change in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable, resulted in a use of cash of $47 million in fiscal 2015, compared to a use of cash of $117 million in fiscal 2014, favorably impacting year-over-year cash flows by $70 million. the cash flow impact of the change in inventory and accounts payable was driven by the timing of receipt and payment of merchandise purchases. the improvement in operating cash flows in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 reflects an increase in the receipt of merchandise later in the fourth quarter that will be paid for in the following fiscal year. the change in accrued expenses and other liabilities favorably impacted cash flows by $21 million in fiscal 2015 versus an unfavorable impact of $30 million in fiscal 2014. this favorable impact of $51 million in year-over-year cash flows from operations was driven by last year's payment of approximately $80 million for settlements with tax authorities reducing our fiscal 2014 reserve for uncertain tax positions. additionally, operating cash flows increased by $122 million year-over-year due to the change in income taxes payable and recoverable which is largely driven by the increase in the current tax provision.
operating cash flows for fiscal 2014 decreased $456 million compared to fiscal 2013. net income plus the non-cash impact of depreciation provided cash of $2,686 million in fiscal 2014 compared to $2,416 million in fiscal 2013, an increase of $270 million. the change in merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable, resulted in a use of cash of $117 million in fiscal 2014, compared to a source of cash of $239 million in fiscal 2013. this unfavorable impact of $356 million in year-over-year cash flow from operations was primarily due to the timing of the receipt and payment of year-end inventory. the change in accrued expenses and other liabilities unfavorably impacted operating cash flows by $30 million in fiscal 2014 versus a favorable impact of $269 million in fiscal 2013. this unfavorable impact of $299 million in year-over-year cash flow from operations reflects the change in accrued incentive compensation and a reduction in our reserve for uncertain tax positions as the result of a settlement with tax authorities. additionally, operating cash flows decreased by $165 million year-over-year due to the change in income taxes payable, which was partially offset by an increase in operating cash flows of $81 million from the change in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets.
we have a reserve for the remaining future obligations of operations we have closed, sold or otherwise disposed of including, among others, bob's stores and a.j. wright. the majority of these obligations relate to real estate leases associated with these operations. the reserve balance was $14.6 million at january 31, 2015 and $31.4 million at february 1, 2014. the cash flows required to satisfy obligations of former operations are classified as a reduction in cash provided by operating activities. see note c to the consolidated financial statements for more information.

we expect that we will spend approximately $975 million on capital expenditures in fiscal 2016, including approximately $487 million for our offices and distribution centers (including buying and merchandising systems and information systems) to support growth, $277 million for store renovations and $211 million for new stores. we plan to fund these expenditures through internally generated funds.
in fiscal 2015, we purchased $431 million of investments, compared to $497 million in fiscal 2014. additionally, $388 million of such investments were sold or matured during fiscal 2015 compared to $395 million last year. this activity primarily relates to short-term investments which had initial maturities in excess of 90 days and, per our policy, are not classified as cash on the consolidated balance sheets presented.
we have entered into a lease agreement for the construction and occupancy of a new home office facility in canada. we are deemed the owner of the construction project for accounting purposes and therefore the construction costs incurred to date by the lessor of $60.7 million are included as a construction in progress asset along with a related liability of the same amount on our balance sheet. the asset is included in "land and buildings" and the liability is included in "other long-term liabilities." see note m to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
financing activities: cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $1,560 million in fiscal 2015, $1,144 million in fiscal 2014 and $1,476 million in fiscal 2013.
in june 2014, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 2.75% seven-year notes generating proceeds, net of debt issuance expenses and fees, of $743 million. in july 2014, we used a portion of the proceeds from the 2.75% seven-year notes to redeem the $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.20% notes paying $416 million to the note holders for the present value of principal and future remaining interest payments due on the notes. in fiscal 2014, we issued $500 million of 2.5% ten-year notes generating proceeds, net of debt issuance expenses and fees, of $495 million. see note k to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
tjx repurchased and retired 27.7 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $1.7 billion during fiscal 2015, on a "trade date basis." tjx reflects stock repurchases in its financial statements on a "settlement date" or cash basis. under our stock repurchase programs, we spent $1,651 million to repurchase 27.6 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2015, $1,471 million to repurchase 27.3 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2014 and $1,345 million to repurchase 32.0 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2013. see note e to the consolidated financial statements for more information. in february 2015, we announced that our board of directors authorized an additional repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to an additional $2.0 billion of tjx stock. we currently plan to repurchase approximately $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion of stock under our stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2016. we determine the timing and amount of repurchases based on our assessment of various factors including excess cash flow, liquidity, economic and market conditions, our assessment of prospects for our business, legal requirements and other factors. the timing and amount of these purchases may change.
we declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled $0.70 per share in fiscal 2015, $0.58 per share in fiscal 2014 and $0.46 per share in fiscal 2013. cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled $466 million in fiscal 2015, $394 million in fiscal 2014 and $324 million in fiscal 2013. we also received proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $143 million in fiscal 2015, $146 million in fiscal 2014 and $134 million in fiscal 2013. we expect to pay quarterly dividends for fiscal 2016 of $0.21 per share, or an annual dividend of $0.84 per share, subject to the declaration and approval of our board of directors. this would represent a 20% increase over the per share dividends declared and paid for fiscal 2015.

we traditionally have funded our working capital requirements, including for seasonal merchandise, primarily through cash generated from operations, supplemented, as needed, by short-term bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper. as of january 31, 2015, our cash and cash equivalents held outside the u.s. were $1.2 billion, of which $413.9 million was held in countries where we have the intention to reinvest any undistributed earnings indefinitely. we have provided for deferred u.s. taxes on all undistributed earnings of our subsidiaries in canada, puerto rico, italy, india, hong kong and australia. if we repatriate cash from such subsidiaries, we should not incur additional tax expense, but our cash would be reduced by the amount of taxes paid. for all other foreign subsidiaries, no income taxes have been provided on the undistributed earnings because such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the business. we have no current plans to repatriate cash balances held by such foreign subsidiaries. we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, internally generated funds and our credit facilities, described in note k to the consolidated financial statements, are more than adequate to meet our operating needs over the next fiscal year.
contractual obligations: as of january 31, 2015, we had known contractual obligations (including current installments) under long-term debt arrangements, operating leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations as follows (in thousands):

(1)   includes estimated interest costs and financing lease obligation.
(2)   reflects minimum rent. does not include costs for insurance, real estate taxes, other operating expenses and, in some cases, rentals based on a percentage of sales; these items totaled approximately one-third of the total minimum rent for fiscal 2015. does not include leases reflected in our reserve for former operations.
(3)   includes estimated obligations under purchase orders for merchandise and under agreements for capital items, products and services used in our business, including executive employment and other agreements. excludes agreements that can be cancelled without penalty.
we also have long-term liabilities for which it is not reasonably possible for us to predict when they may be paid which include $460.1 million for employee compensation and benefits and $28.1 million for uncertain tax positions.
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america (gaap) which require us to make certain estimates and judgments that impact our reported results. these judgments and estimates are based on historical experience and other factors which we continually review and believe are reasonable. we consider our most critical accounting policies, involving management estimates and judgments, to be those relating to the areas described below.
inventory valuation: we use the retail method for valuing inventory for all our businesses except stp. under the retail method, the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a cost-to-retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory. it involves management estimates with regard to markdowns and inventory shrinkage. under the retail method, permanent markdowns are reflected in inventory valuation when the price of an item is reduced. typically, a significant area of judgment in the retail method is the amount and timing of permanent markdowns. however, as a normal business practice, we have a specific policy as to when and how markdowns are to be taken, greatly reducing management's discretion and the need for management estimates as to markdowns. inventory shrinkage requires estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods, but we take a full physical inventory near the fiscal year end to determine shrinkage at year end. historically, the variance between estimated shrinkage and actual shrinkage has not been material to our annual financial results. we do not generally enter into arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances that could ultimately affect the value of inventory.

impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and tradenames: we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our long-lived assets, goodwill and tradenames at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur that would indicate that the carrying amounts of those assets are not recoverable. significant judgment is involved in projecting the cash flows of individual stores, as well as of our business units, which involve a number of factors including historical trends, recent performance and general economic assumptions. if we determine that an impairment of long-lived assets has occurred, we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of those assets over the estimated fair value of the assets.
retirement obligations: retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent, in the aggregate, obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and are therefore subject to estimates. we are required to make economic, demographic and other assumptions regarding variables, such as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations, the long-term rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets and assumptions about mortality, all of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period. these assumptions, including the discount rate, which we determine annually based on market interest rates, and our estimated long-term rate of return, which can differ considerably from actual returns, can have a significant impact on the annual cost of retirement benefits and the funded status of our qualified pension plan. if our discount rate were decreased 0.25 percentage points, our fiscal 2015 pension cost for our funded plan would have increased by approximately $6 million. similarly, an increase in the discount of rate of 0.25 percentage points would result in a reduction of pension cost of a similar amount. a change of 0.25 percentage points in our long-term rate of return would increase or decrease our fiscal 2015 pension cost by approximately $2 million. during fiscal 2015, we adjusted our assumptions relating to mortality (the expected lives of our pension participants) in light of new mortality tables issued by the society of actuaries which project longer life expectancies. the change in our mortality assumptions added $59 million to the projected benefit obligation for the funded plan as of january 31, 2015 and will add approximately $7 million to our fiscal 2016 pension cost. when the discount rate, market performance of our plan assets, changes in laws, regulations, actuarial standards or other factors have a negative impact on the funded status of our plan, our required contributions may increase. we also consider these factors in determining the amount of voluntary contributions we may make to the plan in excess of mandatory funding requirements. in fiscal 2015, we funded our qualified pension plan with a voluntary contribution of $150 million.
share-based compensation: in accordance with gaap, we estimate the fair value of stock awards issued to employees and directors under our stock incentive plan. the fair value of the awards is amortized as "share-based compensation" over the vesting periods during which the recipients are required to provide service. we use the black-scholes option pricing model for determining the fair value of stock options granted, which requires management to make significant judgments and estimates such as participant activity and market results. the use of different assumptions and estimates could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of stock option grants and the related compensation cost. a 5% increase in expected volatility would increase the per-option value of our most recent option award by 4% while a decrease of the same amount would decrease the per-option value of our most recent option award by 5%.
casualty insurance: in fiscal 2013, our casualty insurance program was changed from a fixed premium program to a self-insured program. a self-insured casualty insurance program requires us to estimate the total claims we would incur as a component of our annual insurance cost. the estimated claims are developed, with the assistance of an actuary, based on historical experience and other factors. these estimates involve significant judgments and assumptions, and actual results could differ from these estimates. if our estimate for the claims component of our casualty insurance for fiscal 2015 were to change by 5%, the fiscal 2015 pre-tax cost would increase or decrease by approximately $4 million. a large portion of these claims is funded with a non-refundable payment during the policy year, offsetting our estimated claims accrual. we had a net accrual of $14.3 million for the unfunded portion of our casualty insurance program as of january 31, 2015.
reserves for uncertain tax positions: like many large corporations, our income and other tax returns and reports are regularly audited by federal, state and local tax authorities in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions where we operate and such authorities may challenge positions we take. we are engaged in various administrative and judicial proceedings in multiple jurisdictions with respect to assessments, claims, deficiencies and refunds and other tax matters, which proceedings are in various stages of negotiation, assessment, examination, litigation and settlement. the outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain. in accordance with gaap, we evaluate our uncertain
35
tax positions based on our understanding of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date, and we accrue for exposure when we believe that it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the positions we have taken will not be sustained. however, in the next twelve months and in future periods, the amounts we accrue for uncertain tax positions from time to time or ultimately pay, as the result of the final resolutions of examinations, judicial or administrative proceedings, changes in facts, law, or legal interpretations, expirations of applicable statute of limitations or other resolutions of, or changes in, tax positions may differ either positively or negatively from the amounts we have accrued, and may result in reductions to or additions to accruals, refund claims or payments for periods not currently under examination or for which no claims have been made. final resolutions of our tax positions or changes in accruals for uncertain tax positions could result in additional tax expense or benefit and could have a material impact on our results of operations of the period in which an examination or proceeding is resolved or in the period in which a changed outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.
reserves for former operations: as discussed in note c to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in the management's discussion and analysis, we have reserves for probable losses arising for future obligations of former operations, primarily real estate leases. we must make estimates and assumptions about the costs and expenses we will incur in connection with the future obligations of our former operations. the leases relating to a.j. wright and other former operations are long-term obligations, and the estimated cost to us involves numerous estimates and assumptions including when and on what terms we will assign the leases, or sublease the leased properties, whether and for how long we remain obligated with respect to particular leases, the extent to which assignees or subtenants will fulfill our financial and other obligations under the leases, how particular obligations may ultimately be settled and what mitigating factors, including indemnification, may exist to any liability we may have. we develop these assumptions based on past experience and evaluation of various potential outcomes and the circumstances surrounding each situation and location. actual results may differ from our current estimates, and we may decrease or increase the amount of our reserves to adjust for future developments relating to the underlying assumptions and other factors, although we do not expect any such differences to be material to our results of operations.
loss contingencies: certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to us but will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur. our management, with the assistance of our legal counsel, assesses such contingent liabilities. such assessments inherently involve the exercise of judgment. in assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or claims that may result in such proceedings, our legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein.
if the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, we will accrue for the estimated liability in the financial statements. if the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be reasonably estimated, we will disclose the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not reasonably estimable.

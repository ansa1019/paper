item 7: management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction and overview we are a global media and technology company with two primary businesses, comcast cable and nbcuniversal. we present our operations for comcast cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as cable communications, and our operations for nbcuniversal in four reportable business segments. on february 12, 2014, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the "merger agreement") with time warner cable inc. ("time warner cable") whereby time warner cable will become our wholly owned subsidiary (the "time warner cable merger"). on april 25, 2014, in connection with the merger agreement, we entered into an agreement with charter communications, inc. ("charter") that, among other things, would result in a net disposition of approximately 3.7 million video subscribers. additional information about these transactions is presented below.
in 2014, our consolidated revenue and operating income were $68.8 billion and $14.9 billion, respectively.
cable communications segment comcast cable is the nation's largest provider of video, high-speed internet and voice services ("cable services") to residential customers under the xfinity brand, and we also provide similar and other services to small and medium-sized businesses. as of december 31, 2014, our cable systems served 22.4 million video customers, 22.0 million high-speed internet customers and 11.2 million voice customers, with 27.0 million total customer relationships, and passed more than 54 million homes and businesses. our cable communications segment generates revenue primarily from subscriptions to our cable services, which we market individually and in bundled service packages, and from the sale of advertising. in 2014, our cable communications segment generated 64% of our consolidated revenue and 79% of our operating income before depreciation and amortization.
our cable communications segment offers a broad variety of video services with access to hundreds of channels, including premium networks, such as hbo, showtime, starz and cinemax, pay-per-view channels, on demand, our video on demand service that allows customers to watch certain programs when they choose and provides the option to purchase or rent select movies and television shows electronically, and an interactive, on-screen program guide. our video customers may also subscribe to a higher level of video service, including our high-definition video ("hd") and digital video recorder ("dvr") advanced services. our video customers have the ability to use our xfinity online portal or our mobile apps to view certain live television programming and on demand content, browse program listings, and schedule, manage and watch dvr recordings.

we offer a variety of high-speed internet services with downstream speeds of up to 105 mbps, and we also have introduced downstream speeds of up to 505 mbps in limited markets. these services also include our xfinity online portal and mobile apps, which provide access to email, contacts and calendars, as well as online security features. in addition, we are actively deploying wireless gateways, which combine a customer's wireless router, cable modem and voice adapter, to improve the performance of multiple internet-enabled devices used at the same time within the home, provide faster internet speeds and create an in-home wi-fi network. we are continuing to expand our network of outdoor, business and in-home wi-fi hotspots for most of our high-speed internet customers to access our high-speed internet services inside and outside the home, and there are currently 8.3 million hotspots accessible to most of our customers.
our voice services provide local and long-distance calling and other related features.
we offer our cable services to small (up to 20 employees) and medium-sized (up to 500 employees) businesses ("business services"). in addition to the features we provide to our residential customers, our services for business customers include an interactive tool that allows customers to share, coordinate and store documents online, hosted voice services that use cloud network servers, a business directory listing, and the added capacity for multiple phone lines. we also offer to our medium-sized business customers advanced voice services and ethernet network services that connect multiple locations and provide higher downstream speed options, and we provide cellular backhaul services to mobile network operators to help those customers manage network bandwidth.
customers are typically billed in advance on a monthly basis based on the services and features they receive and the type of equipment they use. residential cable services customers may generally discontinue service at any time, while business customers may only discontinue service in accordance with the terms of their contracts, which typically have 2 to 5 year terms.
our cable communications segment also sells advertising through our spotlight business. as part of our distribution agreements with cable networks, we generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time on cable networks that we sell to local, regional and national advertisers.
the most significant operating cost for our cable communications segment is the programming expenses we incur to provide content to our video customers. we anticipate that our programming expenses will continue to increase. we have and will continue to attempt to maintain a consistent operating margin in our cable communications segment through rate adjustments, the sale of additional cable services, including advanced services, and the continued growth of business services, as well as by achieving operating efficiencies.

time warner cable merger on february 12, 2014, we entered into the merger agreement with time warner cable. time warner cable is among the largest providers of video, high-speed internet and voice services in the united states, located mainly in five geographic areas: new york state (including new york city), the carolinas, the midwest (including ohio, kentucky and wisconsin), southern california (including los angeles) and texas. as of december 31, 2014, time warner cable had 11.0 million video customers, 12.3 million high-speed internet customers and 5.6 million voice customers. as a result of the time warner cable merger, time warner cable stockholders will receive, in exchange for each share of time warner cable common stock owned immediately prior to the time warner cable merger, 2.875 shares of our class a common stock. we estimate that at the time of closing, time warner cable stockholders will own approximately 24% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. because the exchange ratio was fixed at the time of the merger agreement and the market value of our class a common stock will continue to fluctuate, the number of shares of class a common stock to be issued and the total value of the consideration exchanged will not be determinable until
49      comcast 2014 annual report on form 10-k the closing date. the time warner cable merger was approved by both comcast shareholders and time warner cable stockholders in october 2014. the time warner cable merger remains subject to regulatory approval and other customary conditions and is expected to close in early 2015.
divestiture transactions the terms of the merger agreement contemplated that we would divest systems serving up to approximately 3 million of our video customers following the time warner cable merger in order to obtain applicable regulatory approvals. as a result of this commitment, on april 25, 2014, we entered into an agreement with charter that, if consummated, would satisfy the divestiture undertaking. under this agreement, following the close of the time warner cable merger and subject to various conditions, we agreed to divest cable systems which would result in a net disposition of approximately 3.7 million video customers through three transactions: (1) a spin-off of certain of our existing cable systems serving approximately 2.5 million of our video customers (the "spin-off transaction") into a newly formed public entity ("spinco"), (2) an exchange of certain former time warner cable cable systems serving approximately 1.5 million video customers for charter cable systems serving approximately 1.6 million video customers, and (3) a sale to charter of certain former time warner cable cable systems serving approximately 1.4 million video customers for cash (collectively, the "divestiture transactions").
in connection with and prior to the spin-off transaction, it is expected that spinco would incur new debt. the debt would consist of credit facilities to fund cash distributions to us and notes which spinco would issue to us. these notes would enable us to complete a debt-for-debt exchange where financial institutions would exchange a portion of our debt securities for the new spinco notes, which would effectively retire a portion of our debt. in the spin-off transaction, we would distribute the common stock of spinco pro rata to the holders of all of our outstanding common stock as of the record date, which would occur following the close of the time warner cable merger. after the spin-off transaction, a newly formed, wholly owned indirect subsidiary of charter would merge with and into charter, with the effect that all shares of charter would be converted into shares of a new holding company, which would survive as the publicly traded parent company of charter ("new charter"). new charter would then acquire an interest in spinco by issuing new charter stock in exchange for a portion of the outstanding spinco stock, following which it is expected that comcast shareholders would own approximately 67% of spinco and new charter would own approximately 33% of spinco. in addition, comcast shareholders would own new charter stock as a result of the exchange of outstanding spinco stock with new charter, although the actual number of shares would depend on a number of factors, some of which would not be determinable until the completion of the divestiture transactions. following the close of the divestiture transactions, we would no longer have any ownership interest in spinco.
the close of the divestiture transactions is subject to the completion of the time warner cable merger, the spinco financing transactions, approval by charter's stockholders, regulatory approvals and other customary conditions. the time warner cable merger and the divestiture transactions are subject to separate conditions, and the time warner cable merger can be completed regardless of whether the divestiture transactions are ultimately completed. the closing of the divestiture transactions is expected to occur 30 to 60 days following the close of the time warner cable merger.
competition the results of operations of our reportable business segments are affected by competition, as all of our businesses operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment, news and information content to consumers.
competition for our bundled cable services that include video, high-speed internet and/or voices services consists primarily of direct broadcast satellite ("dbs") providers, which have a national footprint and compete comcast 2014 annual report on form 10-k   50
in all of our service areas, and phone companies with fiber-based networks, which overlap approximately 55% of our service areas and are continuing to expand their fiber-based networks. our high-speed internet services primarily compete with phone companies with fiber-based networks, which overlap approximately 60% of our service areas and also are continuing to expand their fiber-based networks. many of these competitors offer features, pricing and packaging for these services, individually and in bundles, comparable to what we offer. in may 2014, at&t, our largest phone company competitor, announced its intention to acquire directv, the nation's largest dbs provider. if completed, this transaction will create an even larger competitor for our cable services that will have the ability to expand its cable service offerings to include bundled wireless offerings.
there also continue to be new companies, some with significant financial resources, that potentially may compete on a larger scale with some or all of our cable services. for example, companies continue to emerge that provide internet streaming and downloading of video programming, some of which charge a nominal or no fee, and google is providing high-speed internet and video services in a limited number of areas in which we operate and recently announced plans to expand into additional geographical areas. moreover, wireless technology, such as 3g and 4g wireless broadband services and wi-fi networks, may compete with our video and high-speed internet services, and our voice services are facing increased competition as customers replace landline phones with mobile phones and internet-based phone services such as skype.
each of nbcuniversal's businesses also faces substantial and increasing competition from providers of similar types of content, as well as from other forms of entertainment and recreational activities. nbcuniversal also must compete to obtain talent, programming and other resources required in operating these businesses.
technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape for all of our businesses by challenging existing business models and affecting consumer behavior. services and devices that enable online digital distribution of movies, television shows, and other cable and broadcast video programming continue to gain consumer acceptance and evolve, including some services that charge a nominal or no fee for such programming. a number of companies have announced plans to launch online video services that will reportedly involve both linear and on-demand programming, and one traditional provider of cable services has begun to offer smaller packages of programming networks directly to customers over the internet at prices lower than our traditional cable service package offerings. these services and devices may negatively affect demand for our video services, as well as demand for content from our cable networks, broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses, as the number of entertainment choices available to consumers increases and the challenges posed by audience fragmentation intensify and audience ratings are pressured. in addition, delayed viewing and advertising skipping have become more common as the penetration of dvrs and similar products has increased and as content has become increasingly available via video on demand services and internet sources, which may have a negative impact on our advertising revenue.
in our cable communications segment, we believe that adding more content and delivering it through an increasing variety of platforms will assist in attracting and retaining customers for our cable services. to further enhance our video and high-speed internet services, we continue to develop and launch new technology initiatives, such as our x1 platform and cloud dvr technology, and deploy wireless gateway devices. in our nbcuniversal segments, to compete for consumers of our content and for customers at our theme parks, we have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial amounts in acquiring content and producing original content for our cable and broadcast television networks and our owned local broadcast television stations, including the acquisition of sports rights. we will also continue to invest in our film productions and in the development of new theme park attractions.
51      comcast 2014 annual report on form 10-k for additional information on the competition facing our businesses, see item 1, business and refer to the "competition" discussion within that section.
seasonality and cyclicality each of our businesses is subject to seasonal and cyclical variations. in our cable communications segment, our results are impacted by the seasonal nature of customers receiving our cable services in college and vacation markets. this generally results in a reduction in net customer additions in the second quarter and an increase in net customer additions in the third and fourth quarters of each year.
revenue in our cable communications, cable networks and broadcast television segments is subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. our u.s. advertising revenue is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of each year, due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season. u.s. advertising revenue is also cyclical, with a benefit in even-numbered years due to advertising related to candidates running for political office and issue-oriented advertising. revenue in our cable networks and broadcast television segments fluctuates depending on the timing of when our programming is aired on television, which typically results in higher advertising revenue in the second and fourth quarters of each year. our revenue and operating costs and expenses are cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of major sporting events such as the olympic games, which affects our cable networks and broadcast television segments, and the super bowl, which affects our broadcast television segment. our advertising revenue generally increases in the period of these broadcasts due to increased demand for advertising time, and our operating costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs and the amortization of the related rights fees.
revenue in our filmed entertainment segment fluctuates due to the timing of the release of our films in movie theaters, on dvd and electronically through digital distributors. release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. as a result, revenue tends to be seasonal, with increases experienced each year during the summer months and around the holidays. revenue in our cable networks, broadcast television and filmed entertainment segments also fluctuates due to the timing of when our owned content is made available to licensees.
revenue in our theme parks segment fluctuates with changes in theme park attendance that result from the seasonal nature of vacation travel, local entertainment offerings and seasonal weather variations. our theme parks generally experience peak attendance during the summer months when schools are closed and during early winter and spring holiday periods.

consolidated depreciation and amortization increased slightly in 2014 primarily due to increases in capital spending in our cable communications and nbcuniversal segments, as well as increases related to our acquisitions in 2013 of our corporate headquarters and real estate properties by nbcuniversal. consolidated depreciation and amortization increased slightly in 2013 primarily due to increases in capital spending in our cable communications and theme parks segments, as well as depreciation associated with the acquisition of real estate properties by nbcuniversal in 2013.
segment operating results our segment operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information. we use operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, excluding impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses from the sale of assets, if any, as the measure of profit or loss for our operating segments. this measure eliminates the significant level of noncash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of certain of our businesses and from intangible assets recognized in business combinations. additionally, it is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities. we use this measure to evaluate our consolidated operating performance and the operating performance of our operating segments and to allocate resources and capital to our operating segments. it is also a significant performance measure in our annual incentive compensation programs. we believe that this measure is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing
55      comcast 2014 annual report on form 10-k our operating performance with that of other companies in our industries, although our measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies. because we use operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization to measure our segment profit or loss, we reconcile it to operating income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states ("gaap"), in the business segment footnote to our consolidated financial statements (see note 18 to comcast's consolidated financial statements and note 17 to nbcuniversal's consolidated financial statements). this measure should not be considered a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss) attributable to comcast corporation or nbcuniversal, net cash provided by operating activities, or other measures of performance or liquidity we have reported in accordance with gaap.

beginning in 2014, our cable communications segment revised the methodology it uses for counting and reporting customers who reside in multiple dwelling units ("mdus") and are billed under bulk contracts (the "billable customers method"). for mdus whose residents have the ability to receive additional cable services, such as additional programming choices or our hd or dvr advanced services, we now count and report customers based on the number of potential billable relationships within each mdu. for mdus whose residents are not able to receive additional cable services, the mdu is now counted as a single customer. previously, we had counted and reported these customers on an equivalent billing unit basis by dividing monthly revenue received under an mdu's bulk contract by the standard monthly residential rate where the mdu was located (the "ebu method"). we believe the billable customers method is consistent with the methodology used by other companies in our industry to count and report customers.

cable communications segment  revenue our cable communications segment leverages our existing cable distribution system to grow revenue by, among other things, adding new customers, encouraging existing cable customers to add new or higher-tier services, and expanding our other services such as our business services offerings and our home security and automation services. we offer our cable services in bundles and often provide promotional incentives. we seek to balance promotional offers and rate increases with their expected effects on the number of customers and overall revenue.
video video revenue increased 1.2% and 2.9% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. the increases in revenue in both years were due to increases in the number of customers receiving additional and higher levels of video service and rate adjustments, partially offset by decreases in the number of residential video customers. the increases in customers receiving additional and higher levels of video service accounted for increases in revenue of 2.7% and 4.7% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. as of december 31, 2014, 13.0 million customers subscribed to at least one of our hd or dvr advanced services compared to 12.5 million customers and 11.8 million customers as of december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. while we had rate adjustments in both 2014 and 2013, rate adjustments were not as significant in 2014 compared to 2013. the decrease in the number of residential video customers in 2014 and 2013 was primarily due to competitive pressures in our service areas from phone and dbs competitors, and the impact of rate adjustments.
as of december 31, 2014, 40.9% of the homes and businesses in the areas we serve subscribed to our video services, compared to 41.9% and 43.0% as of december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. we may experience further declines in the number of residential video customers.
high-speed internet high-speed internet revenue increased 9.5% and 8.3% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. increases in the number of residential customers receiving our high-speed internet services accounted for increases in revenue of 5.9% and 6.0% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. the remaining increases in revenue in 2014 and 2013 were primarily due to higher rates from customers receiving higher levels of service and from rate adjustments.
as of december 31, 2014, 40.2% of the homes and businesses in the areas we serve subscribed to our high-speed internet services, compared to 38.4% and 36.4% as of december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. our customer base continues to grow as consumers continue to choose our high-speed internet services and seek higher-speed offerings.
voice voice revenue increased 0.4% and 2.8% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. while the growth rate of residential customer additions slowed in 2014, the increase in the number of residential customers receiving our voice services through our discounted bundled offerings accounted for increases in revenue of 5.1% and 6.0% in comcast 2014 annual report on form 10-k   58
2014 and 2013, respectively. the increases in revenue were partially offset in both years by the impact of the allocation of voice revenue for our bundled customers. the amounts allocated to voice revenue in the bundled rate decreased in 2014 and 2013 because video and high-speed internet rates increased, while voice rates remained relatively flat.
as of december 31, 2014, 20.5% of the homes and businesses in the areas we serve subscribed to our voice services, compared to 19.9% and 18.7% as of december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
business services business services revenue increased 21.9% and 26.4% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. the increases in 2014 and 2013 were primarily due to a higher number of small business customers receiving our high-speed internet and voice services. the remaining increases in both years were primarily due to continued growth in the number of customers receiving our ethernet network and cellular backhaul services.
in 2014, our medium-sized business customers represented 22% of total business services revenue, compared to 19% and 15% in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
we believe the increases in the number of business customers are primarily the result of our efforts to gain market share from competitors by offering competitive services and pricing.
advertising as part of our distribution agreements with cable networks, we generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time on cable networks that our spotlight business sells to local, regional and national advertisers. in most cases, the available advertising units are sold by our sales force. in some cases, we work with representation firms as an extension of our sales force to sell a portion of the advertising time allocated to us. we also represent the advertising sales efforts of other multichannel video providers in some markets. in addition, we generate revenue from the sale of advertising online and on our on demand service. advertising revenue is affected by the strength of the advertising market and general economic conditions.
advertising revenue increased 11.5% in 2014 primarily due to an increase in political advertising revenue of 8.0%, as well as an increase in revenue in our national and local advertising markets. excluding the impact of political advertising revenue, advertising revenue increased 3.5% in 2014. advertising revenue decreased 4.2% in 2013 primarily due to lower political advertising revenue. excluding the impact of political advertising revenue, advertising revenue increased 4.8% in 2013 primarily due to increases in our national and regional advertising markets.
other we receive revenue related to cable franchise and other regulatory fees. we also receive revenue related to our digital media center, commissions from electronic retailing networks, and fees from other services, such as our home security and automation services. cable franchise and other regulatory fees represent the fees we are required to pay to federal, state and local authorities that we pass through to our customers. under the terms of our cable franchise agreements, we are generally required to pay to the cable franchising authority an amount based on our gross video revenue. the changes in franchise and other regulatory fees collected from our cable services customers are generally due to changes in the revenue on which the fees apply.
other revenue increased 4.9% and 10.5% in 2014 and 2013, respectively, primarily due to increases in revenue from our home security and automation services, as well as increases in cable franchise and other regulatory fees.
59      comcast 2014 annual report on form 10-k cable communications segment  operating costs and expenses we continue to focus on controlling the growth of expenses. our operating margin, which is our operating income before depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue, for 2014, 2013 and 2012 was 41.0%, 41.1% and 41.0%, respectively.
programming expenses programming expenses, which represent our largest operating expense, are the fees we pay to license the programming we distribute to our video customers. these expenses are affected by the programming license fees charged by cable networks, the fees charged for retransmission of the signals from local broadcast television stations, the number of video customers we serve and the amount of content we provide. programming expenses increased in 2014 and 2013 primarily due to increases in programming license fees, including retransmission consent fees and sports programming costs, and fees to secure rights for additional programming for our customers across an increasing number of platforms.
we anticipate that our programming expenses will continue to increase as we provide additional content, including in hd, to our video customers; as we deliver this content through an increasing number of platforms, including on demand, online and through our mobile apps; and as the fees we pay increase, primarily retransmission consent fees and sports programming costs. we believe that adding more content and delivering it on various platforms will help us to attract and retain video customers.
technical and product support expenses technical and product support expenses include costs to complete service call and installation activities, as well as costs for network operations, product development, fulfillment and provisioning. technical and product support expenses increased in 2014 and 2013 primarily due to expenses related to the development, delivery and support of our enhanced devices and services, including our x1 platform, cloud dvr technology and wireless gateways, and the continued growth in business services. the increase in 2014 was also due to expenses related to our home security and automation services and the increase in 2013 was also due to customer fulfillment activities.
customer service expenses customer service expenses include the personnel and other costs associated with handling the sale of services to customers and customer service activity. customer service expenses increased in 2014 and 2013 primarily due to increases in total labor costs associated with increases in customer service activity. the increases in customer service activity were primarily due to sales and related support activities associated with the continued deployment of enhanced devices and services, which include our x1 platform, cloud dvr technology, wireless gateways, and home security and automation services, and the continued growth in business services.
franchise and other regulatory fees franchise and other regulatory fees increased in 2014 and 2013 primarily due to increases in revenue from residential cable services and business services related to the fees we are required to pay to federal, state and local authorities.
advertising, marketing and promotion expenses advertising, marketing and promotion expenses increased in 2014 and 2013 primarily due to increases in spending associated with attracting new residential and business services customers and encouraging existing customers to add additional or higher-tier services.
other costs and expenses other costs and expenses increased in 2014 and 2013 primarily due to increases in costs to support our advertising sales business, as well as increases in other administrative costs.

consolidated income tax expense income tax expense reflects federal and state income taxes, adjustments associated with uncertain tax positions and, until we acquired general electric company's ("ge") 49% common equity interest in nbcuniversal holdings that we did not already own in march 2013 (the "nbcuniversal redemption transaction"), the partnership structure of nbcuniversal holdings whereby income tax expense was not recorded on the portion of its consolidated income that was attributable to ge's noncontrolling interest. our effective income tax rate in 2014, 2013 and 2012 was 31.1%, 35.8% and 32.3%, respectively.
in september 2014, we reduced our accruals for uncertain tax positions and the related accrued interest on these tax positions and, as a result, our income tax expense decreased by $724 million. see note 15 to comcast's consolidated financial statements for additional information on the changes in our accruals for uncertain tax positions and related interest on these tax positions. in 2013, our effective income tax rate increased compared to 2012 due to the nbcuniversal redemption transaction, following which we recorded income tax expense on all of nbcuniversal's consolidated income. in addition, our 2013 income tax expense was reduced by $158 million due to the nontaxable portion of the increase in tax basis associated with the redemption of liberty media series a common stock in october 2013.
our income tax expense in the future may continue to be impacted by adjustments to uncertain tax positions and related interest, and changes in tax laws. we expect our 2015 annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 37% to 39%, absent changes in tax laws or significant changes in uncertain tax positions. in addition, the time warner cable merger and the divestiture transactions may result in changes to our existing deferred income tax liabilities due to changes in the apportionment factors related to state income taxes. any such changes will be reflected in income tax expense as of the respective closing dates.
consolidated net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock the decreases in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock in 2014 and 2013 were primarily due to the nbcuniversal redemption transaction.

cable communications capital expenditures increased in 2014 and 2013 primarily due to an increase in customer premise equipment purchases, including purchases related to our x1 platform and cloud dvr technology, as well as purchases related to our wireless gateways in 2013, and increased investment in business services and network infrastructure to increase network capacity.

share repurchases and dividends in january 2014, our board of directors increased our share repurchase program authorization to $7.5 billion. the authorization allows us to repurchase shares in the open market or in private transactions and does not have an expiration date. in 2014, we repurchased a total of 81 million shares of our class a special and class a common stock for $4.25 billion, which includes $1.25 billion of the additional $2.5 billion of shares we committed to repurchase following the shareholder approvals for the time warner cable merger. in addition, because we and time warner cable have received shareholder approval for the merger, we intend to repurchase an additional $1.25 billion of shares through the close of the time warner cable merger in early 2015, subject to market conditions. as of december 31, 2014, we had $3.25 billion remaining under the board's authorization.
in february 2015, our board of directors increased our share repurchase program authorization to $10 billion, which does not have an expiration date. under this authorization, we may repurchase shares in the open market or in private transactions. we expect to repurchase $4.25 billion of shares during 2015, including the remaining $1.25 billion of additional shares we committed to repurchase in connection with the time warner cable merger, subject to market conditions. additional share repurchases above the $4.25 billion commitment in 2015 will be determined following the close of the time warner cable merger and the related divestiture transactions with charter.
our board of directors declared quarterly dividends totaling $2.3 billion in 2014. we paid dividends of $2.3 billion in 2014. in february 2015, our board of directors approved an 11.1% increase in our dividend to $1.00 per share on an annualized basis and approved our first quarter dividend of $0.25 per share to be paid in april 2015. we expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, although each dividend is subject to approval by our board of directors.

recent accounting pronouncements see note 3 to each of comcast's and nbcuniversal's consolidated financial statements for additional information related to recent accounting pronouncements.
critical accounting judgments and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. we base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
we believe our judgments and related estimates associated with the valuation and impairment testing of our cable franchise rights, the accounting for film and television costs, and the accounting for income taxes are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgments and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors, and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them, which are presented below. see notes 9, 6 and 15 to comcast's consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies with respect to these items.
valuation and impairment testing of cable franchise rights our largest asset, our cable franchise rights, results from agreements we have with state and local governments that allow us to construct and operate a cable business within a specified geographic area. the value of a franchise is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market new services, such as advanced video services and high-speed internet and voice services, in a particular service area. the amounts we record for cable franchise rights are primarily a result of cable system acquisitions. typically when we acquire a cable system, the most significant asset we record is the value of the cable franchise rights. often these cable system acquisitions include multiple franchise areas. we currently serve approximately 6,400 franchise areas in the united states.
we have concluded that our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors which limit the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows. accordingly, we do not amortize our cable franchise rights but assess the carrying value of our cable franchise rights annually, or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed the fair value ("impairment testing").
for the purpose of our impairment testing, we have grouped the recorded values of our various cable franchise rights into our three cable communications divisions or units of account. we evaluate the unit of account periodically to ensure our impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level.
the annual impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles allows for the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible is less than its carrying amount. an entity may choose to perform the qualitative assessment or an entity may comcast 2014 annual report on form 10-k   76
bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. if it is determined, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible is, more likely than not, less than its carrying value, the quantitative impairment test is required. when performing a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair value of our cable franchise rights primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment. when analyzing the fair values indicated under the discounted cash flow models, we also consider multiples of operating income before depreciation and amortization generated by the underlying assets, current market transactions and profitability information.
in 2014, we performed a quantitative assessment of our cable franchise rights. based on our quantitative analysis, the estimated fair values of our franchise rights exceeded the carrying value of the northeast, central and west divisions by 26%, 50% and 42%, respectively.
since the adoption of the accounting guidance related to goodwill and intangible assets in 2002, we have not recorded any significant impairment charges to cable franchise rights as a result of our impairment testing. a future change in the unit of account could result in the recognition of an impairment charge.
we could also record impairment charges in the future if there are changes in long-term market conditions, in expected future operating results, or in federal or state regulations that prevent us from recovering the carrying value of these cable franchise rights. assumptions made about increased competition and economic conditions could also impact the results of any qualitative assessment and the valuations used in future annual quantitative impairment testing and result in a reduction in the fair values of our cable franchise rights.
film and television costs we capitalize film and television production costs, including direct costs, production overhead, print costs, development costs and interest. we amortize capitalized film and television production costs, including acquired libraries, and accrue costs associated with participation and residual payments to programming and production expense. we generally record the amortization and the accrued costs using the individual film forecast computation method, which amortizes such costs using the ratio of the current period's revenue to estimated total remaining gross revenue from all sources ("ultimate revenue"). estimates of ultimate revenue have a significant impact on how quickly capitalized costs are amortized and, therefore, are updated regularly.
our estimates of ultimate revenue for films generally include revenue from all sources that are expected to be earned within 10 years from the date of a film's initial release. these estimates are based on the historical performance of similar content, as well as factors unique to the content itself. the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue for a film intended for theatrical release is the film's theatrical performance, as subsequent revenue from the licensing and sale of a film has historically exhibited a high correlation to its theatrical performance. upon a film's release, our estimates of revenue from succeeding markets, including home entertainment and other distribution platforms, are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends.
with respect to television series or other owned television programming, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue is whether the series can be successfully licensed beyond its initial license. initial estimates of ultimate revenue are limited to the amount of revenue contracted for each episode under the initial license. once it is determined that a television series or other owned television programming can be licensed for subsequent platforms, revenue estimates for these platforms, such as u.s. and international syndication, home entertainment, and other distribution platforms, are included in ultimate revenue. revenue estimates for produced episodes include revenue expected to be earned within 10 years of delivery of the initial episode or, if still in production, 5 years from the delivery of the most recent episode, if later.
77      comcast 2014 annual report on form 10-k capitalized film and television costs, as well as stage play production costs, are subject to impairment testing when certain triggering events are identified. if the fair value of a production were to fall below its unamortized cost, we would record an adjustment for the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs exceed the production's fair value. the fair value assessment is generally based on estimated future discounted cash flows, which are supported by our internal forecasts. adjustments to capitalized film and stage play production costs of $26 million, $167 million and $161 million were recorded in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
income taxes we base our provision for income taxes on our current period income, changes in our deferred income tax assets and liabilities, income tax rates, changes in estimates of our uncertain tax positions, and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which we operate. we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations, and we record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations.
from time to time, we engage in transactions in which the tax consequences may be subject to uncertainty. in these cases, we evaluate our tax positions using the recognition threshold and the measurement attribute in accordance with the accounting guidance related to uncertain tax positions. examples of these transactions include business acquisitions and dispositions, including consideration paid or received in connection with these transactions, certain financing transactions, and the allocation of income among state and local taxing jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the tax consequences of these transactions. we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in our financial statements. the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized when the position is ultimately resolved.
we adjust our estimates periodically to reflect changes in circumstances in ongoing examinations by and settlements with the various taxing authorities, as well as changes in tax laws, regulations and precedent. we believe that adequate accruals have been made for income taxes. when uncertain tax positions are ultimately resolved, either individually or in the aggregate, differences between our estimated amounts and the actual amounts are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flow for any one period. in september 2014, we reduced our accruals for uncertain tax positions and the related accrued interest on these tax positions. the reduction resulted in a decrease of $724 million in income tax expense, which excludes the benefits of uncertain tax positions for which we have been indemnified. as of december 31, 2014, our uncertain tax positions and related accrued interest were $1.2 billion and $452 million, respectively.

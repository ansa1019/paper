item 7
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) includes the following sections:
•   executive overview that discusses at a high level our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business.
•   critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments underlying our financial statements.
•   results of operations that includes a more detailed discussion of our revenue and expenses.
•   liquidity and capital resources which discusses key aspects of our statements of cash flows, changes in our balance sheets and our financial commitments.
you should note that this md&a discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. please see the section entitled "forward-looking statements and risk factors" at the beginning of item 1a for important information to consider when evaluating such statements.
you should read this md&a in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes in item 8 of this annual report. in fiscal 2014 we acquired check inc. and in fiscal 2012 we acquired demandforce, inc. we have included their results of operations in our consolidated results of operations from the dates of acquisition.
in fiscal 2013 we completed the sale of our intuit websites business and in fiscal 2014 we completed the sales of our intuit financial services (ifs) and intuit health businesses. we accounted for all of these businesses as discontinued operations and have therefore reclassified our statements of operations for all periods presented to reflect them as such. we have also reclassified our balance sheets for all periods presented to reflect ifs as discontinued operations. the net assets of intuit websites and intuit health were not significant, so we have not reclassified our balance sheets for any period presented to reflect them as discontinued operations. because the cash flows of our intuit websites, ifs, and intuit health discontinued operations were not material for any period presented, we have not segregated the cash flows of those businesses from continuing operations on our statements of cash flows. see "results of operations - non-operating income and expense - discontinued operations" later in this item 7 for more information. unless otherwise noted, the following discussion pertains to our continuing operations.
executive overview this overview provides a high level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business. we believe that an understanding of these trends is important in order to understand our financial results for fiscal 2014 as well as our future prospects. this summary is not intended to be exhaustive, nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.

tables of contents industry trends and seasonality the industry in which we operate is dynamic and highly competitive, and we expect it to remain so in the future. the markets for software and related services, especially highly-available connected services, are characterized by rapid technological change, shifting customer needs, and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. competitive interest and expertise in many of the markets we serve have grown markedly over the past few years and we expect this trend to continue. there are also large, cloud-based service companies who innovate quickly and serve small businesses and consumers. while today our competition with such companies may be limited, as we and those companies grow, our competition with them may increase. in recent years the widespread availability of the internet, the emergence of mobile devices, and the explosion of social media have accelerated the pace of change and revolutionized the way that people throughout the world manage important financial tasks. the result is a global market that is shifting from traditional services that are paper-based, human-produced, and brick-and-mortar bound, to one where people understand, demand, and embrace the benefits of connected services. this trend toward connected services is the primary driver of the strategies in all of our businesses.
historically, our quickbooks, consumer tax, and professional tax offerings have been highly seasonal. revenue from our quickbooks software products have tended to be highest during our second and third fiscal quarters. sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated from november through april. in our consumer tax business, a greater proportion of our revenue has shifted to later in this seasonal period due in part to the growth in sales of turbotax online, for which we recognize revenue when tax returns are printed or electronically filed. the seasonality of our consumer tax and professional tax revenue is also affected by the timing of the availability of tax forms from taxing agencies and the ability of those agencies to receive electronic tax return submissions. delays in the availability of tax forms or the ability of taxing agencies to receive submissions can cause revenue to shift between our fiscal quarters. these seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second quarter ending january 31 and third quarter ending april 30. we typically report losses in our first quarter ending october 31 and fourth quarter ending july 31. during these quarters, revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while core operating expenses such as research and development continue at relatively consistent levels.
in august 2014 we announced that we will begin delivering ongoing releases for our future desktop offerings in order to improve the product experience, accommodate operating system updates, and provide access to connected services. we believe that providing more frequent releases will create a better experience for customers who choose our desktop offerings, as well as a more seamless transition to our online offerings in the future. this decision will affect the timing of revenue recognition for future sales of our quickbooks and quicken desktop products, where revenue will be recognized over approximately three years, and our professional tax solutions, where more revenue will be recognized later in the tax year. as a result of this decision, in fiscal 2015 we expect to defer approximately $400 million in revenue to future periods. we expect the seasonality of our small business and professional tax offerings to be partially mitigated by this change beginning in fiscal 2015.
key challenges and risks our growth strategy depends upon our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new markets, and to drive broad adoption of the products and services we develop and market. our future growth also increasingly depends on the strength of our third-party business relationships and our ability to continue to develop, maintain and strengthen new and existing relationships. to remain competitive and continue to grow, we are investing significant resources in our product development, marketing, and sales capabilities, and we expect to continue to do so in the future.
as we continue transitioning to offer more connected services, the ongoing operation and availability of our information technology and communication systems and those of our external service providers is becoming increasingly important. because we help customers manage their financial lives, we face risks associated with the hosting, collection, use and retention of personal customer information and data. we are investing significant management attention and resources in our information technology infrastructure and in our privacy and security capabilities, and we expect to continue to do so in the future.
for a complete discussion of the most significant risks and uncertainties affecting our business, please see "forward-looking statements and risk factors" in item 1a of this report.
overview of financial results the most important financial indicators that we use to assess our business are revenue growth for the company as a whole, for each reportable segment, and for product lines within each reportable segment; operating income growth and operating income margins for the company as a whole and for each reportable segment; earnings per share; and cash flow from operations. we also track certain non-financial drivers of revenue growth and, when material, identify them in the applicable discussions of segment results below. these non-financial drivers include, for example, customer growth and retention for all of our
32
tables of contents businesses, annualized recurring revenue (arr) for our small business online ecosystem, and transaction volume for our payment processing business. we define arr as four times the most recent fiscal quarter revenue for our online small business offerings, including quickbooks online, online payroll, online payments, demandforce, and quickbase. total credit and debit card transaction volume correlates strongly with the macroeconomic environment and is one of the key drivers of revenue growth in our payment processing business. customers for our connected services offerings have generally grown faster than those for our traditional desktop software offerings, reflecting our strategic focus on connected services over the past few years. connected services generated $3.0 billion or 66% of our total revenue in fiscal 2014, compared with 50% of our total revenue six years ago. we expect connected services revenue as a percentage of our total revenue to continue to grow in the future.
total net revenue for fiscal 2014 was $4.5 billion, an increase of 8% compared with fiscal 2013. our small business and consumer segments were the key drivers of revenue growth. revenue in our small business segment increased 10% compared with fiscal 2013 due to growth in connected services offerings. revenue in our consumer segment increased 7% compared with fiscal 2013 due to 10% growth in paid federal turbotax units, partially offset by changes in product mix.
operating income from continuing operations increased 7% in fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 due to higher revenue partially offset by higher costs and expenses. operating expenses were higher due to increases in staffing expenses and, to a lesser extent, to increases in expenses for marketing programs and share-based compensation. net income from continuing operations increased 5% in fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 due to the increase in operating income and a gain on the sale of an equity investment, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate in the fiscal 2014 period. diluted net income per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2014 increased 9% to $2.96 as a result of the increase in net income and the decline in weighted average diluted common shares compared with fiscal 2013.
we ended fiscal 2014 with cash, cash equivalents and investments totaling $1.9 billion. in fiscal 2014 we generated cash from operations, from the sale of our intuit financial services business and, to a lesser extent, from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans. during the same period we used cash for the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, acquisitions of businesses, the payment of cash dividends, and capital expenditures. at july 31, 2014, we had authorization from our board of directors to expend up to an additional $1.9 billion for stock repurchases through august 19, 2017.
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap), we are required to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue, operating income or loss and net income or loss, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet. we believe that the estimates, assumptions, and judgments involved in the following accounting policies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies:
•   revenue recognition
•   business combinations
•   goodwill, acquired intangible assets, and other long-lived assets - impairment assessments
•   accounting for share-based compensation plans
•   legal contingencies
•   accounting for income taxes - estimates of deferred taxes, valuation allowances, and uncertain tax positions our senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this annual report on form 10-k with the audit and risk committee of our board of directors.
revenue recognition we derive revenue from the sale of software subscriptions, hosted services, packaged software products, financial supplies, technical support plans, transaction fees, merchant services hardware, and multiple element arrangements that may include a combination of these items. we follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue. for additional information, see "revenue recognition" in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report. we generally recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable. however, determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves exercising judgment and using estimates that can have a significant impact on the timing and
33
tables of contents amount of revenue we report. for example, for multiple element arrangements containing only software and software-related elements, we must exercise judgment and use estimates in order to (1) allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver; (2) determine whether undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services; (3) determine whether vendor-specific evidence of fair value exists for each undelivered element; and (4) determine whether and when each element has been delivered. for multiple element arrangements containing non-software elements, we must exercise judgment and use estimates in order to (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of vendor-specific evidence (vsoe) of fair value if available, third-party evidence (tpe) if vsoe is not available, and estimated selling price (esp) if neither vsoe nor tpe is available; and (3) allocate the total price among the various elements based on the relative selling price method. if we were to change any of these judgments or estimates, it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period. amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied.
in connection with the sale of certain products, we provide a limited amount of free technical support assistance to customers. we do not defer the recognition of any revenue associated with sales of these products since the cost of providing this free technical support is insignificant. the technical support is generally provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized and free product enhancements are minimal and infrequent. we accrue the estimated cost of providing this free support upon product shipment.
business combinations as described in "description of business and summary of significant accounting policies - business combinations," in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report, under the acquisition method of accounting we generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree at their fair values as of the date of acquisition. we measure goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred, which we also measure at fair value, over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. the acquisition method of accounting requires us to exercise judgment and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition, including the fair values of identifiable intangible assets, deferred tax asset valuation allowances, liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, and contingencies. this method also requires us to refine these estimates over a one-year measurement period to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. if we are required to retroactively adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions, these adjustments could materially decrease our operating income and net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet.
significant estimates and assumptions that we must make in estimating the fair value of acquired technology, customer lists, and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could record impairment charges. in addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. if our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed.
goodwill, acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets - impairment assessments we estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets that have finite useful lives whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. we test for potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or whenever indicators of impairment arise. the timing of the annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods.
as described in "description of business and summary of significant accounting policies - goodwill, acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets," in note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report, in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill we use a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow model (known as the income approach) and comparisons to publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses (known as the market approach). the income approach requires us to use a number of assumptions, including market factors specific to the business, the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time, long-term growth rates for the business, and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. we evaluate cash flows at the reporting unit level. although the assumptions we use in our discounted cash flow model are
34
tables of contents consistent with the assumptions we use to generate our internal strategic plans and forecasts, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows from each reporting unit and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows. when using the market approach, we make judgments about the comparability of publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses. we base our judgments on factors such as size, growth rates, profitability, risk, and return on investment. we also make judgments when adjusting market multiples of revenue, operating income, and earnings for these companies to reflect their relative similarity to our own businesses. we had a total of $1.6 billion in goodwill on our balance sheet at july 31, 2014. see note 5 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for a summary of goodwill by reportable segment.
we estimate the recoverability of acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets that have finite useful lives by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that we expect the asset to generate. in order to estimate the fair value of those assets, we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets. the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows. we also make judgments about the remaining useful lives of acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets that have finite lives. we had a total of $199 million in net acquired intangible assets on our balance sheet at july 31, 2014.
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective. they can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. for example, if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of one or more of our reporting units, we may be required to record future impairment charges for goodwill and acquired intangible assets. impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet.
during the fourth quarters of fiscal 2014, fiscal 2013, and fiscal 2012 we performed our annual goodwill impairment tests. using the methodology described in "description of business and summary of significant accounting policies - goodwill, acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets," in note 1 to the financial statements in part 8 of this annual report, we determined that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and that they were not impaired. in addition, during this analysis we concluded that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values.
in march 2013 the largest customer for our intuit health business acquired a company that offered similar solutions and competed with us directly in that market space. as a result, we performed an interim impairment test of goodwill and acquired intangible assets during the third quarter of fiscal 2013. we concluded that the carrying amounts of goodwill and certain definite-lived acquired intangible assets associated with our intuit health business were impaired and recorded an impairment charge of approximately $46 million that reduced the carrying value of those assets to zero. see "fair value measurements - assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis," in note 2 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 management approved a plan to sell our intuit health business and we accounted for it as discontinued operations. in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 we completed the sale for cash consideration that was not significant. intuit health was part of our former other businesses reportable segment.
accounting for share-based compensation plans at july 31, 2014, there was $455 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans which we will amortize to expense in the future. total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures. we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average vesting period of 2.4 years.
we use a lattice binomial model and the assumptions described in note 11 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report to estimate the fair value of stock options granted. we estimate the expected term of options granted based on implied exercise patterns using a binomial model. we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of publicly traded one-year and two-year options on our common stock. our decision to use implied volatility is based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. we base the risk-free interest rate that we use in our option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on constant maturity u.s. treasury issues with equivalent remaining terms. we use an annualized expected dividend yield in our option valuation model. we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
35
tables of contents we use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. we amortize the fair value of options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods. we may elect to use different assumptions under our option valuation model in the future, which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share.
restricted stock units (rsus) granted typically vest based on continued service. we value these time-based rsus at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method, adjusted for estimated forfeitures. we amortize the fair value of time-based rsus on a straight-line basis adjusted for estimated forfeitures over the service period. certain rsus granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of pre-established performance or market goals. we estimate the fair value of performance-based rsus at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method and the probability that the specified performance criteria will be met, adjusted for estimated forfeitures. each quarter we update our assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved and adjust our estimate of the fair value of the performance-based rsus if necessary. we amortize the fair values of performance-based rsus over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. we estimate the fair value of market-based rsus at the date of grant using a monte carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. the monte carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of market-based rsus at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. provided that the requisite service is rendered, the total fair value of the market-based rsus at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved. however, the number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria. all of the rsus we grant have dividend rights that are subject to the same vesting requirements as the underlying equity awards, so we do not adjust the intrinsic (market) value of our rsus for dividends. see note 11 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information.
legal contingencies we are subject to certain legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business. we review the status of each significant matter quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure. if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss. if we determine that a loss is possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined, then we disclose the range of the possible loss. significant judgment is required in the determination of whether a potential loss is probable, reasonably possible, or remote as well as in the determination of whether a potential exposure is reasonably estimable. our accruals are based on the best information available at the time. as additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.
accounting for income taxes - estimates of deferred taxes, valuation allowances, and uncertain tax positions we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the united states internal revenue service or other taxing jurisdictions. we estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which we show on our balance sheet. we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. to the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period, we record a corresponding tax expense in our statement of operations.
at july 31, 2014, we had net deferred tax assets of $72 million which included a valuation allowance of $24 million for loss and tax credit carryforwards related to state tax credits, state capital and operating losses, and foreign losses. we recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire. while we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient, we could in the future be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize. we assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. the assessment is based on our estimates of future sources of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable. see note 10 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information.
36
tables of contents we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. we evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. our evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues. changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change, which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results.

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013
total net revenue increased $335 million or 8% in fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013, driven by revenue growth in our small business and consumer segments. revenue in our small business segment was up 10%. continued growth in revenue for quickbooks online, quickbooks enterprise solutions, and quickbooks plus subscription offerings was partially offset by lower quickbooks desktop license revenue. revenue growth for our small business payroll solutions was driven by 25% growth in online payroll subscribers and price increases for desktop payroll customers. revenue in our consumer segment increased 7% due to 10% growth in paid federal turbotax units, partially offset by changes in product mix. revenue in our professional tax segment revenue increased 4% due to price increases and new customer growth for our higher-priced offerings.
operating income from continuing operations increased 7% in fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 due to the increase in revenue described above partially offset by higher costs and operating expenses. total operating expenses were $163 million higher in the fiscal 2014 period, including about $134 million for higher staffing expenses, about $22 million for higher marketing program expenses, and about $18 million for higher share-based compensation expenses. see "cost of revenue" and "operating expenses" later in this item 7 for more information.
net income from continuing operations increased 5% in fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 due to the increase in operating income and a $21 million gain on the sale of an equity investment, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate in the fiscal 2014 period. see "non-operating income and expenses - income taxes" later in this item 7 for more information. diluted net income per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2014 increased 9% to $2.96 as a result of the increase in net income and the decline in weighted average diluted common shares compared with fiscal 2013.
fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012
total net revenue increased $363 million or 10% in fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012, driven by revenue growth in our small business and consumer segments. revenue in our small business segment was up 16%, or 12% excluding revenue from demandforce, which we acquired in may 2012. higher organic revenue in this segment was driven by continuing growth in quickbooks online, small business payroll, and small business payments revenue. in our consumer segment, revenue increased 4% due to 4% growth in paid federal turbotax units. revenue in our professional tax segment increased 5% due to customer growth and price increases.
operating income from continuing operations increased 6% in fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 due to the increase in revenue described above partially offset by higher costs and operating expenses. total operating expenses were $306 million
37
tables of contents higher in the fiscal 2013 period, including about $100 million for higher staffing expenses, about $60 million for higher advertising and other marketing program expenses, and about $23 million for higher share-based compensation expenses. see "cost of revenue" and "operating expenses" later in this item 7 for more information.
net income from continuing operations increased 8% in fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 due to higher operating income and lower interest expense due to the repayment of debt in march 2012. diluted net income per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2013 increased 8% to $2.72, in line with the increase in net income compared with fiscal 2012.
segment results the information below is organized in accordance with our three reportable segments. all of our segments operate primarily in the united states and sell primarily to customers in the united states. international total net revenue was approximately 5% of consolidated total net revenue for all periods presented.
segment operating income is segment net revenue less segment cost of revenue and operating expenses. segment expenses do not include certain costs, such as corporate selling and marketing, product development, and general and administrative expenses and share-based compensation expenses, which are not allocated to specific segments. these unallocated costs totaled $890 million in fiscal 2014, $809 million in fiscal 2013, and $724 million in fiscal 2012. unallocated costs increased in fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 and in fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 due to increases in corporate product development and selling and marketing expenses in support of the growth of our businesses and to a lesser extent due to increases in share-based compensation expenses. segment expenses also do not include amortization of acquired technology, amortization of other acquired intangible assets, and goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges. see note 14 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for reconciliations of total segment operating income to consolidated operating income from continuing operations for each fiscal year presented.

service and other revenue in our small business segment is derived primarily from quickbooks online and quickbooks online accountant, our hosted financial and business management offerings; quickbooks pro plus, quickbooks premier plus, and quickbooks accountant plus, our subscription offerings; quickbooks technical support plans; small business payroll services, including quickbooks online payroll, intuit online payroll, intuit full service payroll, and quickbooks assisted payroll; payment processing services for small businesses; demandforce; and quickbase. product revenue in our small business segment is derived primarily from quickbooks desktop software products, including quickbooks pro, quickbooks premier, quickbooks accountant, and quickbooks enterprise solutions; quickbooks basic payroll and quickbooks enhanced payroll; quickbooks point of sale solutions; proadvisor program subscriptions for the accounting professionals who serve small businesses; and financial supplies.
as part of our connected services strategy, over the past several quarters we have been focusing small business segment resources on the enhancement and marketing of our quickbooks online and quickbooks desktop subscription offerings. as a result, quickbooks desktop license units and revenue have been declining as more customers choose our hosted and subscription offerings and we expect this trend to continue. in our payments business we have recently begun focusing resources on core offerings for quickbooks merchants in support of our small business ecosystem approach. over the next few quarters we anticipate declining revenue for certain non-quickbooks payments offerings that may slow overall revenue growth in our payments business.

tables of contents fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013
consumer segment total net revenue increased $123 million or 7% in fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 due to 10% growth in paid federal turbotax units, partially offset by changes in product mix. online federal units represented approximately 80% of total federal turbotax units for the 2013 tax season, up from approximately 78% for the 2012 tax season.
consumer segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue increased slightly in fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 due to the higher revenue described above and lower expenses for advertising and other marketing programs in fiscal 2014.
fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012
consumer segment total net revenue increased $67 million or 4% in fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 due to 4% growth in paid federal turbotax units. online federal units represented approximately 78% of total federal turbotax units for the 2012 tax season, up slightly from approximately 77% for the 2011 tax season.
consumer segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue increased in fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 due to the higher revenue described above partially offset by slightly higher costs and expenses. higher expenses for advertising and other marketing programs were nearly offset by lower costs for refund debit card processing and data center hosting costs in our consumer tax business. debit card processing costs were lower because we offered that program through a partner in fiscal 2013 rather than managing it internally, as we did in fiscal 2012.

tables of contents fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012
total operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenue increased to 57% in fiscal 2013 from 54% in fiscal 2012. revenue grew $363 million and total operating expenses increased $306 million in fiscal 2013. the increase in operating expenses included the addition of operating expenses for demandforce, which we acquired in may 2012. operating expenses increased about $100 million for staffing expenses associated with higher headcount, about $60 million for advertising and other marketing programs in our quickbooks and consumer tax businesses, and about $23 million for higher share-based compensation expenses. share-based compensation expenses have been increasing over time because the market price of our common stock has generally been increasing and because our grants have been transitioning away from stock options and toward restricted stock units, which have a higher grant date fair value than stock options.
non-operating income and expenses interest expense in march 2007 we issued five-year and ten-year senior unsecured notes totaling $1 billion. in march 2012 we repaid $500 million of those senior notes when they became due using cash from operations. interest expense of $31 million in fiscal 2014, $30 million in fiscal 2013, and $50 million in fiscal 2012 consisted primarily of interest on these senior notes. see note 9 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information.

interest and other income, net consists primarily of interest income and net gains and losses on executive deferred compensation plan assets. higher average invested balances and slightly higher average interest rates resulted in higher interest income in fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013. lower average interest rates and stable average invested balances resulted in lower interest income in fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012. in accordance with authoritative guidance, we record gains and losses associated with executive deferred compensation plan assets in interest and other income and gains and losses associated with the related liabilities in operating expenses. the total amounts recorded in operating expenses for each period are approximately equal to the total amounts recorded in interest and other income in those periods.
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we sold our available-for-sale equity security for $26 million and recorded the gain of $21 million in interest and other income on our statement of operations. see note 3 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information.
in connection with our acquisition of digital insight corporation in fiscal 2007, we acquired stock warrants for a privately held company. during fiscal 2012 that company was acquired and we recorded a gain of approximately $10 million on the disposition of the warrants in interest and other income on our statement of operations.
income taxes effective tax rate our effective tax rates for fiscal 2014, fiscal 2013, and fiscal 2012 were approximately 34%, 32%, and 33%. the differences between these rates and the federal statutory rate of 35% were primarily related to the tax benefit received from the domestic production activities deduction and the federal research and experimentation credit, partially offset by state income taxes. see note 10 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information about our effective tax rates.

tables of contents net deferred tax assets at july 31, 2014, we had net deferred tax assets of $72 million which included a valuation allowance of $24 million for loss and tax credit carryforwards related state tax credits, state capital and operating losses, and foreign losses. we recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire. while we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient, we could in the future be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize. we assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. the assessment is based on our estimates of future sources of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable. see note 10 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for more information.
we provide u.s. federal income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries' earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in our international operations. to the extent that foreign earnings previously treated as indefinitely reinvested are repatriated, the related u.s. tax liability may, subject to certain limitations, be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings. at july 31, 2014, the cumulative amount of earnings upon which u.s. income taxes had not been provided was approximately $48 million. the unrecognized deferred tax liability for these earnings was approximately $7 million.
discontinued operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 we completed the sale of our intuit websites business for approximately $60 million in cash and recorded a gain on disposal of approximately $32 million, net of income taxes. we completed the sale of our intuit financial services business in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 for approximately $1.025 billion in cash and recorded a gain on disposal of approximately $36 million, net of income taxes. in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 we also completed the sale of our intuit health business for cash consideration that was not significant and recorded a $4 million pre-tax loss on disposal that was more than offset by a related income tax benefit of approximately $14 million, resulting in a net gain on disposal of approximately $10 million. we have reclassified our statements of operations for all periods presented to reflect these three businesses as discontinued operations. see note 7 to the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for a more complete description of these discontinued operations and the impact that they have had on our statements of operations for the fiscal periods presented.
liquidity and capital resources overview at july 31, 2014, our cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $1.9 billion, an increase of $253 million from july 31, 2013 due to the factors described in "statements of cash flows" below. our primary source of liquidity has been cash from operations, which entails the collection of accounts receivable for products and services. our primary uses of cash have been for research and development programs, selling and marketing activities, capital projects, acquisitions of businesses, debt service costs, repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, and the payment of cash dividends. as discussed in "executive overview - industry trends and seasonality" earlier in this item 7, our business is subject to significant seasonality. the balance of our cash, cash equivalents and investments generally fluctuates with that seasonal pattern. we believe the seasonality of our business is likely to continue in the future.

tables of contents we have historically generated significant cash from operations and we expect to continue to do so during fiscal 2015. since our operations are primarily domestic, approximately 90% of our cash, cash equivalents and investments at july 31, 2014 were located in the u.s. and none of those funds were restricted. our only significant debt consists of $500 million in senior unsecured notes due in march 2017. we also have an unused $500 million unsecured revolving line of credit facility available to us for general corporate purposes, including future acquisitions.
we evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the merits of acquiring technology or businesses, or establishing strategic relationships with and investing in other companies. our strong liquidity profile enables us to respond nimbly to these kinds of opportunities.
based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, contractual obligations, commitments, debt service requirements, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next 12 months. we expect to return excess cash generated by operations to our stockholders through repurchases of our common stock and payment of cash dividends, after taking into account our operating and strategic cash needs.
statements of cash flows the following table summarizes selected items from our statements of cash flows for fiscal 2014, fiscal 2013, and fiscal 2012. see the financial statements in item 8 of this annual report for complete statements of cash flows for those periods.

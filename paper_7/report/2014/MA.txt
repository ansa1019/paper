item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes of mastercard incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including mastercard international incorporated ("mastercard international") (together, "mastercard" or the "company"), included elsewhere in this report. certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2014 presentation. percentage changes provided throughout "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" were calculated on amounts rounded to the nearest thousand.
non-gaap financial information non-gaap financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a company's performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("gaap").  pursuant to the requirements of regulation s-k, portions of this "management's
28
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" include a reconciliation of certain non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures.  the presentation of non-gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company's related financial results prepared in accordance with gaap.
mastercard presents non-gaap financial measures to enhance an investor's evaluation of mastercard's ongoing operating results and to facilitate meaningful comparison of its results between periods. mastercard's management uses these non-gaap financial measures to, among other things, evaluate its ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation.  more specifically, the following non-gaap financial measures are presented in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations:
•   total operating expenses and operating expense growth excluding the provision recorded in 2013 ($95 million) and 2012 ($20 million) for settlements relating to u.s. merchant litigations (collectively referred to as the "mdl provision"). mastercard excluded these items because mastercard's management monitors provisions for material litigation settlements separately from ongoing operations and evaluates ongoing performance without these amounts. see "operating expenses" for the table that provides a reconciliation of operating expenses and operating expense growth excluding the mdl provisions to the most directly comparable gaap measure.
•   effective income tax rate excluding the 2013 mdl provision. mastercard excluded this item because mastercard's management monitors provisions for material litigation settlements separately from ongoing operations and evaluates ongoing performance without these amounts. see "income taxes" for the table that provides a reconciliation of the effective income tax rate excluding the 2013 mdl provision to the most directly comparable gaap measure.
overview we recorded net income of $3.6 billion, or $3.10 per diluted share in 2014 versus net income of $3.1 billion, or $2.56 per diluted share in 2013, and net income of $2.8 billion, or $2.19 per diluted share in 2012. during 2014, net income growth of 16% was driven by higher net revenue and an improved effective tax rate, partially offset by increased operating expenses.
our 2014 results were positively impacted by a tax benefit resulting from a repatriation of foreign earnings, which was offset by restructuring expenses and the impact of acquisitions. in 2013 and 2012, net income was impacted by the increased mdl provisions of $95 million ($61 million after tax) and $20 million ($13 million after tax), respectively.
our net revenue increased 14% and 13% in 2014 and 2013 versus the comparable periods in the prior years, respectively, primarily driven by increases across our revenue categories, partially offset by higher rebates and incentives. acquisitions contributed 2 percentage points to net revenue growth in 2014. in 2014 and 2013, our processed transactions increased 12% and 13% versus the comparable periods in the prior years, respectively. in 2014 and 2013, our volumes increased 13% and 14%, on a local currency basis, versus the comparable periods in the prior years, respectively.
operating expenses in 2014 increased $524 million, or 14%, from 2013 and increased $389 million, or 11%, in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to higher general and administrative expenses as a result of investments to support strategic initiatives. acquisitions contributed 6 percentage points to operating expense growth in 2014.
we generated net cash flows from operations of $3.4 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to $4.1 billion and $2.9 billion for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

business environment we process transactions from more than 210 countries and territories and in more than 150 currencies. net revenue generated in the united states was 39% of total revenue in each of 2014, 2013 and 2012. no individual country, other than the united states, generated more than 10% of total revenue in any such period, but differences in market growth, economic health and foreign exchange fluctuations in certain countries can have an impact on the proportion of revenue generated outside the united states over time. while the global nature of our business helps protect our operating results from adverse economic conditions in a single or a few countries, the significant concentration of our revenue generated in the united states makes our business particularly susceptible to adverse economic conditions in the united states.
the competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides both challenges to and opportunities for the continued growth of our business. adverse economic trends (including distress in financial markets, turmoil in specific economies around the world and additional government intervention) have impacted the environment in which we operate. certain of our customers, merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands, have been directly impacted by these adverse economic conditions.
mastercard's financial results may be negatively impacted by actions taken by individual financial institutions or by governmental or regulatory bodies. in addition, further political instability or a decline in economic conditions in the countries in which the company operates may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance. as a result, our revenue may be negatively impacted, or the company may be impacted in several ways. mastercard continues to monitor political and economic conditions around the world to identify opportunities for the continued growth of our business and to evaluate the evolution of the global payments industry. notwithstanding recent encouraging trends, the extent and pace of economic recovery in various regions remains uncertain and the overall business environment may present challenges for mastercard to grow its business. for a full discussion see "risk factors - business risk" in part i, item 1a of this report.
in addition, our business and our customers' businesses are subject to regulation in many countries. regulatory bodies may seek to impose rules and price controls on certain aspects of our business and the payments industry. for further discussion, see note 18 (legal and regulatory proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 and our risk factor in "risk factors - legal and regulatory risks" in part i, item 1a of this report. further, information security risks for global payments and technology companies such as mastercard have significantly increased in recent years. although to date we have not experienced any material impacts relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, there can be no assurance that we will be immune to these risks and not suffer such losses in the future. see our risk factor in "risk factors - business risks" in part i, item 1a of this report related to a failure or breach of our security systems or infrastructure as a result of cyber-attacks.
impact of foreign currency rates our overall operating results can be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, especially the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar versus the euro and brazilian real. the functional currency of mastercard europe, our principal
30
european operating subsidiary, is the euro, and the functional currency of our brazilian subsidiary is the brazilian real. accordingly, the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar versus the euro and brazilian real impacts the translation of our european and brazilian subsidiaries' operating results into the u.s. dollar. for 2014 as compared to 2013 and for 2013 compared to 2012, the u.s. dollar strengthened against the brazilian real but weakened against the euro. the net foreign currency impact of changes in the u.s. dollar average exchange rates against the euro and brazilian real negatively impacted net income in 2014 by less than 1 percentage point as compared to 2013. conversely, net income in 2013 was positively impacted by approximately 1 percentage point as compared to 2012.
in addition, changes in foreign currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume ("gdv") and gross euro volume ("gev"), which are used in the calculation of our domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees and volume related rebates and incentives. in most non-european regions, gdv is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to u.s. dollars using average exchange rates for the period. in europe, gev is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to euros using average exchange rates for the period. as a result, our domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees and volume related rebates and incentives are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar versus primarily non-european local currencies and the strengthening or weakening of the euro versus primarily european local currencies. the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar is evident when gdv growth on a u.s. dollar converted basis is compared to gdv growth on a local currency basis. in 2014, gdv on a u.s. dollar converted basis increased 9%, versus gdv growth on a local currency basis of 13%. in 2013, gdv on a u.s. dollar converted basis increased 13%, versus gdv growth on a local currency basis of 14%. the company attempts to manage these foreign currency exposures through its foreign exchange risk management activities, which are discussed further in note 20 (foreign exchange risk management) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report.
the company generates revenue and has financial assets in countries at risk for currency devaluation. while these revenues and financial assets are not material to mastercard on a consolidated basis, they could be negatively impacted if a devaluation of local currencies occurs relative to the u.s. dollar.
financial results revenue revenue description mastercard's business model involves four participants in addition to us: cardholders, merchants, issuers (the cardholders' financial institutions) and acquirers (the merchants' financial institutions). our gross revenue is generated by assessing our customers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity on the cards and other devices that carry our brands and from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other payment-related products and services. our revenue is based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers. our primary revenue billing currencies are the u.s. dollar, euro and brazilian real.
the price structure for our products and services is complex and is dependent on the nature of volumes, types of transactions and type of products and services we offer to our customers. our net revenue can be significantly impacted by the following:
•   domestic or cross-border transactions;
•   signature-based or pin-based transactions;
•   geographic region or country in which the transaction occurs;
•   volumes/transactions subject to tiered rates;
•   processed or not processed by mastercard;
•   amount of usage of our other products or services; and
•   amount of rebates and incentives provided to customers.
the company classifies its net revenue into the following five categories:
1.   domestic assessments: domestic assessments are fees charged to issuers and acquirers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity on cards and other devices that carry our brands where the merchant country and the issuer country are the same. domestic assessments include items such as card assessments, which are fees charged on the number
31
of cards issued or assessments for specific purposes, such as acceptance development or market development programs.
2.   cross-border volume fees: cross-border volume fees are charged to issuers and acquirers based on the dollar volume of activity on cards and other devices that carry our brands where the merchant country and the issuer country are different. in general, a cross-border transaction generates higher revenue than a domestic transaction since cross-border fees are higher than domestic fees, and in most cases also include fees for currency conversion.
3.   transaction processing fees: transaction processing fees are charged for both domestic and cross-border transactions and are primarily based on the number of transactions. transaction processing fees include charges to issuers for the following:
•   transaction switching fees for the following products and services:
◦   authorization is the process by which a transaction is routed to the issuer for approval. in certain circumstances such as when the issuer's systems are unavailable or cannot be contacted, mastercard or others, on behalf of the issuer approve in accordance with either the issuer's instructions or applicable rules (also known as "stand-in").
◦   clearing is the exchange of financial transaction information between issuers and acquirers after a transaction has been successfully conducted at the point of interaction. mastercard clears transactions among customers through our central and regional processing systems.
◦   settlement is facilitating the exchange of funds between parties.
•   connectivity fees are charged to issuers and acquirers for network access, equipment and the transmission of authorization and settlement messages. these fees are based on the size of the data being transmitted through and the number of connections to the company's network.
4.   other revenues: other revenues consist of other payment-related products and services and are primarily associated with the following:
•   consulting and research fees are primarily generated by mastercard advisors, the company's professional advisory services group.
•   fraud products and services used to prevent or detect fraudulent transactions. this includes fees for warning bulletins provided to issuers and acquirers either electronically or in paper form.
•   loyalty and rewards solutions fees are charged to issuers for benefits provided directly to consumers with mastercard-branded cards, such as insurance, assistance for lost cards, locating atms and rewards programs.
•   program management services provided to prepaid card issuers consist of foreign exchange margin, commissions, load fees, and atm withdrawal fees paid by cardholders on the sale and encashment of prepaid cards.
•   the company also charges for a variety of other payment-related products and services, including account and transaction enhancement services, rules compliance and publications.
5.   rebates and incentives (contra-revenue): rebates and incentives are provided to certain mastercard customers and are recorded as contra-revenue.
revenue analysis gross revenue in 2014 and 2013 increased $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion, or 13% versus 2013 and 2012, respectively, driven by an increase in dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands, transactions, other payment-related products and services and the impact of acquisitions. rebates and incentives in 2014 and 2013 increased $329 million and $325 million, or 11% and 12%, versus 2013 and 2012, respectively, due to the impact from new and renewed agreements and increased volumes. our net revenue in 2014 and 2013 increased 14% and 13% versus 2013 and 2012, respectively. acquisitions contributed 2 percentage points to net revenue growth in 2014. in 2014 and 2013, our gdv increased 13% and 14% on a local currency basis while our processed transactions increased 12% and 13%, respectively.

1 excludes volume generated by maestro and cirrus cards.
a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers. in 2014, the net revenue from these customers was approximately $2.2 billion, or 24%, of total net revenue. the loss of any of these customers or their significant card programs could adversely impact our revenue. in addition, as part of our business strategy, mastercard, among other efforts, enters into business agreements with customers. these agreements can be terminated in a variety of circumstances. see our risk factor in "risk factor - business risks" in part i, item 1a of this report for further discussion.
the significant components of our net revenue for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were as follows:

operating expenses our operating expenses are comprised of general and administrative, advertising and marketing, depreciation and amortization expenses and the respective amounts recorded for the mdl provision. operating expenses increased in 2014 by $524 million, or 14%, primarily due to higher general and administrative expenses. acquisitions contributed 6 percentage points to operating expense growth in 2014. operating expenses increased in 2013 by $389 million, or 11% compared to 2012, primarily due to higher general and administrative expenses and the $95 million portion of the mdl provision recorded in 2013. excluding the impact of the mdl provision, operating expenses increased 17% in 2014 compared to 2013 and increased 9% in 2013 compared to 2012.
the following table compares and reconciles operating expenses, excluding the mdl provision, which is a non-gaap financial measure, to the operating expenses including the mdl provision, which is the most directly comparable gaap measurement. management believes this analysis facilitates understanding of our ongoing operating expenses and allows for a more meaningful comparison between periods.

•   personnel expense increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to an increase in the number of employees from both our acquired businesses and to support the company's strategic initiatives. additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2014, the company recorded a restructuring charge of $87 million. the increase in personnel expenses in 2013 compared to 2012 was due to an increase in the number of employees to support our strategic initiatives.
•   professional fees consist primarily of third-party services, legal costs to defend our outstanding litigation and the evaluation of regulatory developments that impact our industry and brand. professional fees increased in both 2014 and 2013, primarily due to higher third-party service expenses.
•   data processing and telecommunication expense consists of expenses to support our global payments network infrastructure, expenses to operate and maintain our computer and telecommunication system. these expenses increased in both 2014 and 2013 due to capacity growth of our business.
•   foreign exchange activity includes gains and losses on foreign exchange derivative contracts and the impact of remeasurement of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. see note 20 (foreign exchange risk management) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report for further discussion. since the company does not designate foreign currency derivatives as hedging instruments pursuant to the accounting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities, it records gains and losses on foreign exchange derivatives on a current basis, with the associated offset being recognized as the exposures materialize.
•   other expenses include loyalty and rewards solutions, travel and entertainment, rental expense for our facilities, litigation settlements not related to the u.s. merchant class litigation, investment related expenses and other miscellaneous operating expenses. the change in other expenses in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to the impact of our current year acquisitions and expenses incurred to support strategic development efforts. the 2013 increase in other expenses versus 2012 was primarily due to increased costs associated with loyalty and rewards programs, investment related expenses and increased meeting and travel expenses.
advertising and marketing our brands, principally mastercard, are valuable strategic assets that drive acceptance and usage of our products and facilitate our ability to successfully introduce new service offerings and access new markets globally. our advertising and marketing strategy is to increase global mastercard brand awareness, preference and usage through integrated advertising, sponsorship, promotions, interactive media and public relations programs on a global scale. we will continue to invest in marketing programs at the regional and local levels and sponsor diverse events aimed at multiple target audiences. in 2014, advertising and marketing expenses increased $21 million, or 3%, mainly due to new and renewed sponsorships and increased support of our strategic initiatives. advertising and marketing expenses increased $66 million, or 8%, in 2013 mainly due to new and renewed sponsorships and increased media spend to support our strategic initiatives.
35
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses increased $63 million, or 24%, in 2014 and $28 million, or 12%, in 2013. the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2014 was primarily due to higher amortization of capitalized software costs and acquisition-related intangible assets. the increase in 2013 was primarily due to higher amortization of capitalized software costs.
provision for litigation settlement as of december 31, 2014, the accrued litigation related to the mdl provision was $771 million versus $886 million as of december 31, 2013. the accrued litigation item includes $68 million as of december 31, 2013 related to the timing of mastercard's administration of the short-term reduction in default credit interchange from u.s. issuers, which expired in april 2014. during 2014, mastercard executed settlement agreements with a number of opt-out merchants and no adjustments to the amount reserved was deemed necessary. in the fourth quarter of 2013, mastercard recorded an incremental net pre-tax charge of $95 million related to the opt-out merchants. see note 18 (legal and regulatory proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report for further discussion.
other income (expense)
other income (expense) is comprised primarily of investment income, interest expense, our share of income (losses) from equity method investments and other gains and losses. total other expense increased $24 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to higher interest expense related to our debt issuance in march 2014. total other expense decreased $1 million in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily related to an adjustment in interest expense due to the reversal of tax reserves, partially offset by increased expenses from investments in joint ventures.
income taxes the effective income tax rates for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were 28.8%, 30.8% and 29.9%, respectively. the effective tax rate for 2014 was lower than the effective tax rate for 2013 primarily due to the recognition of a larger repatriation benefit and an increase in the company's domestic production activity deduction in the u.s. related to the company's authorization revenue, partially offset by an unfavorable mix of taxable earnings in 2014. the effective tax rate for 2013 was higher than the effective tax rate for 2012 primarily due to the recognition of a discrete benefit relating to additional export incentives in 2012 and a lower benefit related to foreign repatriations in 2013, partially offset by a more favorable mix of earnings in 2013.
during the fourth quarter of 2014, we implemented an initiative to better align our legal entity and tax structure with our operational footprint outside of the u.s. this initiative resulted in a one-time taxable gain in belgium relating to the transfer of intellectual property to a related foreign entity in the united kingdom. we believe this improved alignment will result in greater flexibility and efficiency with regard to the global deployment of cash, as well as ongoing benefits in our effective income tax rate. see note 17 (income taxes) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report for further discussion.

during 2014, the company's unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken during the current and prior periods increased by $44 million. the increase in the company's unrecognized tax benefits for 2014 was primarily due to judgments related to current year tax positions. as of december 31, 2014, the company's unrecognized tax benefits related to positions taken during the current and prior period were $364 million, all of which would reduce the company's effective tax rate if recognized.
in 2010, in connection with the expansion of the company's operations in the asia pacific, middle east and africa region, the company's subsidiary in singapore, mastercard asia pacific pte. ltd. ("mappl"), received an incentive grant from the singapore ministry of finance. see note 17 (income taxes) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report for further discussion.
liquidity and capital resources we need liquidity and access to capital to fund our global operations, credit and settlement exposure, capital expenditures, investments in our business and current and potential obligations. the company generates the cash required to meet these needs through operations. the following table summarizes the cash, cash equivalents, time deposits and investment securities balances and credit available to the company at december 31:

2 the company did not use any funds from the line of credit during the periods presented, except for business continuity planning and related purposes.
cash, cash equivalents, time deposits and available-for-sale investment securities held by our foreign subsidiaries (i.e., any entities where earnings would be subject to u.s. tax upon repatriation) was $2.6 billion and $3.6 billion at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, or 42% and 57% of our total cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investment securities as of such dates. the decrease in cash, cash equivalents, time deposits and available-for-sale investment securities held by our foreign subsidiaries during 2014 was primarily driven by prepaid tax in belgium as well as a repatriation of foreign earnings in conjunction with a reorganization undertaken to better align our tax and legal entity structure with our business footprint outside of the u.s. the reorganization occurred in the fourth quarter of 2014.  it is our present intention to permanently reinvest the undistributed earnings associated with our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31, 2014 outside of the united states (as disclosed in note 17 (income taxes) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report), and our current plans do not require repatriation of these earnings. if these earnings are needed for u.s operations or can no longer be permanently reinvested outside of the united states, the company would be subject to u.s. tax upon repatriation.
our liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by global credit market conditions. the company guarantees the settlement of many mastercard, cirrus and maestro-branded transactions between our issuers and acquirers. see note 19 (settlement and other risk management) to the consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this report for a description of these guarantees. historically, payments under these guarantees have not been significant; however, historical trends may not be an indication of the future. the risk of loss on these guarantees is specific to individual customers, but may also be driven
37
significantly by regional or global economic conditions, including, but not limited to the health of the financial institutions in a country or region.
our liquidity and access to capital could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. see our risk factor in "risk factors - legal and regulatory risks" in part i, item 1a and note 18 (legal and regulatory proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report; and part ii, item 7 (business environment) of this report for additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business.

the company believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents and investment securities balances, its cash flow generating capabilities, its borrowing capacity and its access to capital resources are sufficient to satisfy its future operating cash needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations and potential obligations.
debt and credit availability in march 2014, mastercard incorporated issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.000% notes due april 1, 2019 (the "2019 notes") and $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.375% notes due april 1, 2024 (the "2024 notes") (collectively the "notes"). the effective interest rates were 2.081% and 3.426% on the 2019 notes and 2024 notes, respectively. the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses, were $1,484 million. the company is not subject to any financial covenants under the notes. interest on the notes is payable semi-annually on april 1 and october 1, commencing on october 1, 2014. the notes may be redeemed in whole, or in part, at our option at any time for a specified make-whole amount. the notes are senior unsecured obligations and would rank equally with any future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. the proceeds of the notes are to be used for general corporate purposes.

on november 16, 2014, the company extended its committed unsecured revolving credit facility, dated as of november 16, 2012 (the "credit facility"), for an additional year.  the expiration date of the credit facility is november 14, 2019.  the available funding under the credit facility will remain at $3 billion through november 16, 2017 and then decrease to $2.95 billion during the final two years of the credit facility agreement.  other than immaterial changes to certain representations and warranties, the terms and conditions of the credit facility remain unchanged.  the option to request that each lender under the credit facility extend its commitment was provided pursuant to the terms of the credit facility agreement. borrowings under the credit facility are available to provide liquidity for general corporate purposes, including providing liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by the company's customers. in addition, for business continuity planning and related purposes, the company may borrow and repay amounts under the credit facility from time to time. the facility fee and borrowing cost under the credit facility are contingent upon the company's credit rating. at december 31, 2014, the applicable facility fee was 8 basis points on the average daily commitment (whether or not utilized). in addition to the facility fee, interest on borrowings under the credit facility would be charged at the london interbank offered rate (libor) plus an applicable margin of 79.5 basis points, or an alternative base rate. mastercard had no borrowings under the credit facility at december 31, 2014 and 2013.
the credit facility contains customary representations, warranties, events of default and affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant limiting the maximum level of consolidated debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. mastercard was in compliance in all material respects with the covenants of the credit facility at december 31, 2014 and 2013. the majority of credit facility lenders are customers or affiliates of customers of mastercard.
on august 2, 2012, the company filed a universal shelf registration statement to provide additional access to capital, if needed. pursuant to the shelf registration statement, the company may from time to time offer to sell debt securities, preferred stock, class a common stock, depository shares, purchase contracts, units or warrants in one or more offerings.
dividends and share repurchases mastercard has historically paid quarterly dividends on its outstanding class a common stock and class b common stock. subject to legally available funds, we intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend. however, the declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, available cash and current and anticipated cash needs. the following table summarizes the annual, per share dividends paid in the years reflected:

shares in the company's common stock that are repurchased are considered treasury stock. the timing and actual number of additional shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the operating needs of the business, legal requirements, price and economic and market conditions. in december 2014, the company's board of directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the company to repurchase up to $3.75 billion of its class a common stock.  as of january 23, 2015, the repurchases by the company under the december 2013 share repurchase program in 2015 totaled approximately 2.5 million shares of class a common stock for an aggregate cost of approximately $215 million, at an average price of $84.45 per share of class a common stock.  as of january 23, 2015, the company had approximately $3.8 billion remaining under the december 2013 share repurchase program and the december 2014 share repurchase program.

off-balance sheet arrangements mastercard has no off-balance sheet debt, other than lease arrangements and other commitments as presented in the future obligations table that follows.
future obligations the following table summarizes our obligations as of december 31, 2014 that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods. we believe we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and our cash balances.

1 the table does not include the $771 million provision as of december 31, 2014 related to the merchant opt outs and the u.s. merchant class litigation since the opt outs are not fixed and determinable and the company has made a payment into escrow to fund the u.s. merchant class litigation. see note 18 (legal and regulatory proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report for further discussion.
2 amounts primarily relate to sponsorships to promote the mastercard brand. future cash payments that will become due to our customers under agreements which provide pricing rebates on our standard fees and other incentives in exchange for transaction volumes are not included in the table because the amounts due are contingent on future performance. mastercard has accrued $1.7 billion as of december 31, 2014 related to customer and merchant agreements.
3 amounts relate to committed severance, minimum funding requirements for defined benefit plans and unfunded postemployment benefits. u.s. employees hired before july 1, 2007 participate in a non-contributory, qualified, defined benefit pension plan (the "qualified plan") with a cash balance feature. in 2014, the company began to evaluate whether to terminate the qualified plan. we continue to account for the qualified plan on an ongoing basis in our financial statements. if we terminate the plan, we would be obligated to pay the underfunded status of the plan and take a settlement charge for the portion of the liability that has not been recognized in our statement of operations.
4 the company has recorded a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $364 million at december 31, 2014 and estimates that approximately $1 million of this liability is expected to be settled within the next 12 months. these amounts have been excluded from the table since the settlement period for the non-current portion of this liability cannot be reasonably estimated. the timing of these payments will ultimately depend on the progress of tax examinations with the various authorities.
seasonality the company does not experience meaningful seasonality. no individual quarter in 2014, 2013 or 2012 accounted for more than 30% of net revenue.

critical accounting estimates the application of u.s. gaap requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect the company's reported financial condition. we have established detailed policies and control procedures to provide reasonable assurance that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period. the accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that the company considers to be the most critical to its financial statements. an accounting estimate is considered critical if both (a) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (b) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to the company's financial condition. senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of the company's board of directors. the company's significant accounting policies, including recent accounting pronouncements, are described in note 1 (summary of significant accounting policies) to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this report.
a quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where that information is reasonably available, can be reliably estimated and provides material information to investors. the amounts used to assess sensitivity (e.g., 10 percent) are included to allow users of this report to understand a general direction cause and effect of changes in the estimates and do not represent management's predictions of variability. for all of these estimates, it should be noted that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and estimates require regular review and adjustment.
revenue recognition application of the various accounting principles in u.s. gaap related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires the company to make judgments and estimates.  specifically, complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting. domestic assessment revenue requires an estimate of our customers' performance in order to recognize this revenue. rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue based on these estimates. we consider various factors in estimating customer performance, including a review of specific transactions, historical experience with that customer and market and economic conditions. differences between actual results and the company's estimates are adjusted in the period the customer reports actual performance. if our customers' actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance, net revenue may be materially different.
loss contingencies the company is currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. the company regularly reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses its potential financial exposure. if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the company accrues a liability for the estimated loss. significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. as additional information becomes available, the company reassesses the potential liability related to its pending claims and litigation and may revise its estimates. due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes. see note 18 (legal and regulatory proceedings) for further discussion.
income taxes in calculating our effective tax rate, we need to make estimates regarding the timing and amount of taxable and deductible items which will adjust the pretax income earned in various tax jurisdictions. through our interpretation of local tax regulations, adjustments to pretax income for income earned in various tax jurisdictions are reflected within various tax filings. although we believe that our estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable, actual results may be materially different than the estimated amounts.
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. significant judgment is required in determining the valuation allowance. we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. if it is determined that we are able to realize deferred tax assets in excess of the net carrying value or to the extent we are unable to realize a deferred tax asset, we would adjust the valuation allowance in the period in which such a determination is made, with a corresponding increase or decrease to earnings.
we record tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, which may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. we consider all relevant facts and current authorities in the tax law in assessing whether any benefit resulting from an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and,
41
if so, how current law impacts the amount reflected within these financial statements. if upon examination, we realize a tax benefit which is not fully sustained or is more favorably sustained, this would decrease or increase earnings in the period. in certain situations, the company will have offsetting tax credits or taxes in other jurisdictions.
we do not record u.s. income tax expense for foreign earnings which we intend to reinvest indefinitely to expand our international operations. we consider business plans, planning opportunities, and expected future outcomes in assessing the needs for future expansion and support of our international operations. if our business plans change or our future outcomes differ from our expectations, u.s. income tax expense and our effective tax rate could increase or decrease in that period.
valuation of assets the valuation of assets acquired in a business combination and asset impairment reviews require the use of significant estimates and assumptions. the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires the company to estimate the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill. impairment testing for assets, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, requires the allocation of cash flows to those assets or group of assets and if required, an estimate of fair value for the assets or group of assets. the company's estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. these valuations require the use of management's assumptions, which would not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur.
we evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of impairment exist. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. the impairment evaluation utilizes a quantitative assessment using a two-step impairment test. the first step is to compare the reporting unit's carrying value, including goodwill, to the fair value. the company uses a market approach for estimating the fair value of its reporting unit. if the fair value exceeds the carrying value, then no potential impairment is considered to exist. if the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the second step is performed to determine if the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit. an impairment charge would be recorded if the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value. the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a qualitative assessment to evaluate all relevant events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets.  in performing the qualitative assessment, we consider relevant events and conditions, including but not limited to, macroeconomic trends, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, cost factors, company-specific events, and legal and regulatory factors. if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than their carrying amounts, the company must perform a quantitative impairment test.

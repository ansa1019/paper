item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview open surgery remains the predominant form of surgery and is used in almost every area of the body. however, the large incisions required for open surgery create trauma to the patient, typically resulting in longer hospitalization and recovery times, increased hospitalization costs, and additional pain and suffering relative to minimally invasive surgery ("mis"), where mis is available. for over two decades, mis has reduced trauma to the patient by allowing selected surgeries to be performed through small ports rather than large incisions. mis has been widely adopted for certain surgical procedures, but has not yet been widely adopted for reconstructive surgeries.
da vinci surgical systems enable surgeons to extend the benefits of mis to many patients who would otherwise undergo a more invasive surgery by using computational, robotic and imaging technologies to overcome many of the limitations of conventional mis. surgeons using a da vinci surgical system operate while seated comfortably at a console viewing a three dimensional ("3-d") representation of a high definition ("hd") image of the surgical field. this immersive visualization connects surgeons to the surgical field and their instruments. while seated at the console, the surgeon manipulates instrument controls in a natural manner, similar to the open surgery technique. our multi-port technology is designed to provide surgeons with a range of motion of mis instruments in the surgical field analogous to the motions of a human wrist, while filtering out the tremor inherent in a surgeon's hand. in designing our products, we focus on making our technology easy and safe to use.
our products fall into four broad categories - the da vinci surgical systems, insite and firefly fluorescence imaging systems ("firefly"), instruments and accessories (e.g., endowrist, endowrist one vessel sealer, da vinci single-site and endowrist stapler 45) and training technologies. we have commercialized four generations of da vinci surgical systems: the first is our da vinci standard surgical system, commercialized in 1999, the second is our da vinci s surgical system, commercialized in 2006, the third is our da vinci si surgical system, commercialized in 2009, and the fourth is our da vinci xi surgical system, launched in the second quarter of 2014 (see further description in new product introductions section below). systems include a surgeon's console (or consoles), imaging electronics, a patient-side cart, and computational hardware and software.
we offer over 65 different da vinci instruments enabling surgeons flexibility in choosing the types of tools needed in a particular surgery. in the fourth quarter of 2011, we introduced our single-site instruments in the u.s. for use with the da vinci si surgical system and for use in cholecystectomy procedures. during the first quarter of 2013, single-site instruments were cleared by the u.s. food and drug administration (the "fda") in the u.s. for use in benign hysterectomies and salpingo-oophorectomies. single-site instruments enable surgeons to also perform surgery through a single port via the patient's belly button, resulting in the potential for virtually scarless results. the initial instrumentation set for single site surgery was not wristed. however, in september 2014, the fda cleared our wristed needle driver, designed for single-site surgeries. we believe that the wristed needle driver will better enable single site surgeries requiring significant reconstruction, like hysterectomies.
training technologies include our recently developed da vinci connect remote case observation and mentoring tool, our da vinci skills simulator, and our dual console for use in surgeon proctoring and collaborative surgery.
procedures we model patient value as equal to procedure efficacy / invasiveness. in this equation procedure efficacy is defined as a measure of the success of the surgery in resolving the underlying disease and invasiveness is defined as a measure of patient pain and disruption of regular activities. when the patient value of a da vinci procedure is greater than that of alternative treatment options, patients may benefit from seeking out surgeons and hospitals that offer da vinci surgery, which potentially could result in a local market share shift. adoption occurs procedure by procedure, and is driven by the relative patient value of da vinci procedures compared to alternative treatment options for the same disease state or condition.
worldwide procedures da vinci systems and instruments are regulated independently in various countries and regions of the world. the discussion of indications for use and representative or target procedures is intended solely to provide an understanding of the market for da vinci products but is not intended to promote for sale or use any intuitive surgical product outside of its licensed or cleared labeling and indications for use.
the adoption of da vinci surgery has the potential to grow for those procedures that offer greater patient value than non da vinci alternatives, while providing economic return to health care providers. we focus our organization and investments on developing, marketing and training for those products and procedures where da vinci can bring significant patient value relative to alternative treatment options. da vinci surgical systems are used primarily in gynecologic surgery, urologic surgery, general surgery, cardiothoracic surgery, and head and neck surgery. principal target procedures in gynecology include da vinci hysterectomy ("dvh") and sacrocolpopexy. target procedures in urology include da vinci prostatectomy ("dvp") and partial nephrectomy. target procedures in general surgery include colorectal procedures, hernia repair, single-site cholecystectomy, and a broad base
36
of other general surgery procedures. in cardiothoracic surgery, target procedures include da vinci lobectomy and da vinci mitral valve repair. in head and neck surgery, target procedures include certain procedures resecting benign and malignant tumors classified as t1 and t2. not all the indications, procedures or products described may be available in a given country or region or on all generations of da vinci surgical systems. please consult the product labeling in a specific country and for each product in order to determine the actual authorized uses, as well as important limitations, restrictions or contraindications.
in 2014, approximately 570,000 surgical procedures were performed with the da vinci surgical system, compared to approximately 523,000 and 450,000 procedures performed in 2013 and 2012, respectively. the growth in our overall procedure volume in 2014 was driven by the growth in u.s. general surgery procedures and worldwide urologic procedures.
u.s. procedures overall u.s. procedure volume grew to approximately 449,000 in 2014, compared to approximately 422,000 in 2013, and 367,000 in 2012.
gynecology is our largest u.s. surgical specialty. overall u.s. gynecology procedure volume was approximately 235,000 2014 compared to 240,000 in 2013 and 222,000 in 2012. our growth through 2013 was driven by adoption of dvh, our highest volume procedure, and other gynecologic procedures, including sacrocolpopexy and myomectomy largely resulting from capturing market share from open surgery techniques for these procedures. in 2014, our 2% u.s. gynecology procedure decline was driven primarily by fewer benign dvh procedures. as of 2014, we estimate that approximately 80% of total benign hysterectomies were performed via minimally invasive approaches, including robotic, endoscopic, and vaginal techniques. given this high level of mis penetration, we believe our benign hysterectomy volume largely declined with the overall market, which reflected payor trends encouraging more conservative non-surgical disease management approaches for certain uterine conditions. our benign dvh procedure volumes were approximately 148,000, 150,000, and 138,000 in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. we now consider robotic surgery to be the standard of care for hysterectomies for cancer. dvh for cancer procedure volumes were approximately 43,000, 41,000, and 38,000 in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
general surgery is our second largest and fastest growing specialty in the u.s. overall u.s. general surgery procedure volume grew from approximately 42,000 cases in 2012 to approximately 81,000 in 2013 and to approximately 107,000 in 2014. growth through 2013 was driven by rapid adoption of da vinci cholecystectomies, the first procedure to be fda-cleared for single-site surgery, and earlier stage growth in colorectal and several other general surgery procedures. in 2014, cholecystectomy growth moderated, and general surgery growth was driven by growth across a broad set of procedures, including ventral and inguinal hernia repair, colorectal, bariatric, cholecystectomy, foregut, and other procedures.
u.s. urology procedure volume was approximately 91,000 in 2014, compared to approximately 85,000 in 2013, and 88,000 in 2012. we consider dvp to be the standard of care for the surgical treatment of prostate cancer in the u.s. about 60,000 dvps were performed in 2014, compared to 58,000 in 2013, and 62,000 in 2012.
international procedures overall international procedure volume grew to approximately 121,000 in 2014, compared to approximately 101,000 in 2013 and 83,000 in 2012. international procedure growth was driven largely by dvp volume, which grew from approximately 47,000 in 2012, to 56,000 in 2013, to 65,000 in 2014. partial nephrectomy, general surgery, and gynecologic oncology procedures also contributed to international procedure growth.
business model we generate revenue from both the initial capital sales of da vinci surgical systems as well as recurring revenue, derived from sales of instruments, accessories and service. the da vinci surgical system generally sells for approximately between $0.6 million and $2.5 million, depending upon configuration and geography, and represents a significant capital equipment investment for our customers. we generate recurring revenue as our customers consume our endowrist and single-site instrument and accessory products used in performing procedures with the da vinci surgical system. our instruments and accessories have a limited life and will either expire or wear out as they are used in surgery, at which point they are replaced. also, we generate recurring revenue from ongoing system service. we typically enter into service contracts at the time systems are sold at an annual rate of approximately $100,000 to $170,000 per year, depending upon the configuration of the underlying system. these service contracts have generally been renewed at the end of the initial contractual service periods.
recurring revenue has generally grown at a faster rate than system revenue in the last few fiscal years. recurring revenue increased from $1.2 billion, or 57% of total revenue in 2012 to $1.4 billion, or 63% of total revenue in 2013 to $1.5 billion, or 70% of total revenue in 2014. the increase in recurring revenue relative to system revenue reflects lower 2014 system sales and continuing adoption of procedures on a growing base of installed da vinci surgical systems. the installed base of da vinci surgical systems has grown to 3,266 at december 31, 2014, compared with 2,966 at december 31, 2013, and 2,585 at december 31, 2012.
we provide our products through direct sales organizations in the u.s., japan, korea, and europe, excluding spain, portugal, italy, greece and eastern european countries. in june 2014, we terminated our distribution relationship with adachi co., ltd.
37
("adachi"), a japanese distributor and now market, sell, and service our products directly in japan. in the remainder of our world markets, we provide our products through distributors.
regulatory activities clearances and approvals we have obtained the clearances required to market our multiport products associated with the first three generations of our da vinci surgical systems (standard, s, and si systems) for our targeted surgical specialties within the u.s. and most of europe. as we expand indications and introduce new products, we will continue to seek necessary clearances. in february 2013, we received fda clearance to market our single-site instruments for benign hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy procedures. in september 2014, we received fda clearance to market the wristed version of our single-site needle driver product for use in benign hysterectomy, cholecystectomy, and salpingo-oophorectomy procedures.
in march 2014, we received fda clearance to market our da vinci xi system in the u.s. this is our fourth generation da vinci surgical system and is now available to u.s. customers (see the complete description of the da vinci xi surgical system in the new product introductions section). in june 2014, we received ce mark clearance for our da vinci xi surgical system in europe. in october 2014, we received regulatory clearance for our da vinci xi surgical system in korea. regulatory submissions have been made for the da vinci xi surgical system in japan with the status currently pending. the regulatory status of the da vinci xi surgical system in other international markets varies by country.
in april 2014, we received fda clearance to market our da vinci single port surgical system in the u.s. for single-port urologic surgeries. however, we do not plan to commercialize the da vinci single port surgical system until it is further developed and cleared as an extension of the da vinci xi surgical system dedicated to single port surgeries. we will seek additional fda clearance(s) for the da vinci single port surgical system for procedure(s) in which a single small entry point to the body and parallel delivery of instruments is important.  such surgeries could include those performed through a natural orifice like the mouth for head and neck procedures or those performed through a single incision like prostate removal. we are in the process of modifying the da vinci single port surgical system to be compatible with the da vinci xi surgical system and ready for commercialization.
in september 2013, we received fda clearance to expand the indication for use of firefly to include visual assessment of at least one of the major extra-hepatic bile ducts (cystic duct, common bile duct and common hepatic duct), using near infrared imaging. fluorescence imaging of biliary ducts with firefly is intended for use with standard of care white light and, when indicated, intraoperative cholangiography. the device is not intended for standalone use for biliary duct visualization. we believe that the use of firefly during cholecystectomy procedures will enhance the ability of surgeons to identify key anatomical structures during the surgery.
in october 2012, we obtained from the japanese ministry of health, labor, and welfare ("mhlw") approval in japan for our da vinci si surgical systems. effective april 2012, we obtained national reimbursement for dvp procedures in japan, our only broadly reimbursed procedure to date. we are currently seeking reimbursement for additional procedures through the mhlw's senshin iryo process as well as other alternative reimbursement processes. such approvals require in-country clinical data and are considered for reimbursed status in april of even numbered years. no additional procedures were granted in the april 2014 cycle. japanese surgeons have begun registering patients to gather clinical data for partial nephrectomy and gastrectomy surgeries. we also are continuing our discussions with the mhlw and surgical societies concerning the pathway to obtain reimbursement for several other procedures. the next cycle for mhlw reimbursement consideration is april 2016 and there can be no assurance that we will gain additional reimbursements at that time. if we are not successful in obtaining additional regulatory clearances, importation licenses, and adequate procedure reimbursements for future products and procedures, then the demand for our products in japan could be limited. in june 2014 we terminated the distribution relationship with our japanese distributor, adachi, and now market, sell, and service our products directly in japan. prior to the acquisition, these functions were performed through adachi. if we are unable to effectively transition the sales, marketing, regulatory and other operational functions from adachi, our japanese business could be disrupted.
fda inspection an fda inspection of our facilities occurred in april-may 2013 and the fda issued a form fda 483 listing four observations relating to the reporting of field corrections, information which is to be included on reports of field corrections, written procedures for changes to certain product labeling, and design input documentation. we responded to each observation with corrective actions during the course of the inspection and provided additional evidence of corrective actions to the fda in response to the form fda 483. the fda issued a warning letter, dated july 16, 2013, related to two of the four form fda 483 observations asking for additional corrective actions and indicated its intent to perform a follow-up inspection. in addition, the fda collected electronic samples of all our advertising and promotional material for review, and to date has taken no action in connection therewith. we responded to the warning letter, communicating corrective actions taken. the fda re-inspected our facilities during february-march of 2014 to complete a general quality system audit as well as a review of the status of the warning letter and 483 remediation activities. at the end of the inspection, the fda issued a form fda 483 listing five observations related to quality management
38
system improvement opportunities. we responded to the fda with a corrective action plan for those observations. on april 25, 2014, the company received a closure letter from the fda stating that the observations in the july 16, 2013 warning letter have been addressed.
medical device reporting in september of 2012 we contacted the office of surveillance and biometrics ("osb") in the fda center for devices and radiological health ("cdrh") regarding proposed changes to our reporting practices for non-injury malfunction medical device reports ("mdrs"). in addition we discussed summary reporting for well characterized events. as a result of the proposed changes, we have increased our reports of device malfunction mdrs, the vast majority of which are related to instruments and not to systems. by definition, none of these device malfunction mdrs involve reportable injuries or deaths. these mdrs are posted on the fda manufacturer and user facility device experience ("maude") database.
in addition, claims brought to our attention by plaintiffs' attorneys that contain allegations of patient injury are required to be investigated as complaints. in those cases in which da vinci was used and the system cannot yet be ruled out as a cause or contributor of the alleged injury, these cases are reported to the fda as mdrs. this has led to increases in mdrs. during the first quarter 2014, as agreed to by the fda, mdr policy branch, we reported a summary level mdr for 1,406 events related to these claims. 1,387 of these events relate to allegations of injuries that had not previously been reported to us and, subsequently, we had not reported them to the fda; the remaining 19 events are supplemental reports to events previously reported to the fda. in the second quarter of 2014, we filed a second summary level mdr for 455 events related to legal claims. 219 of these events related to allegations of injuries that had not previously been reported to us and, subsequently, we had not reported them to the fda; the remaining 236 events are supplemental reports to events previously reported to the fda.
recalls and corrections medical device companies have regulatory obligations to correct or remove medical devices in the field that could pose a risk to health. the definition of "recalls and corrections" is expansive and includes repair, replacement, inspections, re-labeling and issuance of new, added or reinforcement of instructions for use and training when such actions are taken for specific reasons of safety or compliance. these field actions require stringent documentation, reporting and monitoring worldwide. there are other actions which a medical device manufacturer may take in the field without reporting, including routine servicing, the introduction of new products, and new indications for use and stock rotations.
as we determine whether a field action is reportable in any regulatory jurisdiction, we prepare and submit notifications to the appropriate regulatory agency for the particular jurisdiction. in general, upon submitting required notifications to regulators regarding a field action which is a recall or correction, we will notify customers regarding the field action, provide any additional documentation required in their national language, and arrange, as required, return or replacement of the affected product or a field service visit to perform the correction. in addition, regulators can require the expansion, reclassification, or change in scope and language of the field action. field actions can result in adverse effects on our business, including damage to reputation, delays by customers of purchase decisions, reduction or stoppage of use of installed systems, and reduced revenue as well as increased expenses to complete field actions.
in september 2014, we stopped shipping the endowrist stapler 45 for the da vinci si surgical system and advised our customers to suspend use.  while the observed failure rate in the field was low at 0.023%, based on the total number of staple fires, we believe that immediately suspending use was the best course of action in the interest of patients. our investigation of the three failed endowrist staplers uncovered two separate failure modes in the clamp mechanism: 1) a component failure in two instruments and 2) an assembly error in one instrument. based on these findings, in december 2014, we voluntarily initiated a field recall related to the endowrist stapler 45 instrument for the da vinci si surgical system. we have refined the relevant design elements and manufacturing processes to address these failure modes and have begun shipping replacement instruments in early 2015.
certain outcomes from any of the above regulatory activities may result in material adverse effects on the business, including damage to reputation, delays by customers of purchase decisions, reduction or stoppage of use of installed systems, and reduced revenue as well as increased expenses.

2014 business events and trends procedures overall. during the year ended december 31, 2014, total da vinci procedures grew approximately 9% compared with 16% for the year ended december 31, 2013. procedure growth during the year ended december 31, 2014 was driven by growth in general surgery in the u.s. and worldwide urologic procedures. the lower 2014 procedure growth rate was driven by continued pressure on u.s. benign gynecologic procedures and slowing growth in u.s. cholecystectomy procedures partially offset by growth in several multi-port general surgery procedures, including hernia repair, colorectal, and bariatric procedures and worldwide growth in urologic procedures.
dvp. we believe the u.s. preventive services task force recommendation against psa screening, as well as changes in treatment patterns for low risk prostate cancer away from definitive treatment, contributed to a 15% decline in our dvp business in 2012 and a 6% decline in 2013. u.s. dvp procedures grew 2% for the full year 2014. treatment patterns impacting the u.s. dvp market have likely also impacted our european dvp procedure volumes. as dvp is at earlier market penetration stages in the european markets, we are unable to precisely estimate the extent to which these recommendations and treatment pattern changes may have been adopted by governments or clinicians within non-u.s. jurisdictions.
benign gynecology procedure adoption trends.  during the year ended december 31, 2014, we experienced continued pressure on the category of u.s. benign gynecologic procedures. for the year ended 2014, u.s. benign gynecologic procedures reflected an approximately 3% decline compared to 2013. the pressure on u.s. benign gynecologic procedures reflected a macro trend of fewer benign gynecologic procedures caused by a number of factors including, but not limited to, apparent pressure on benign gynecology hospital admissions, larger patient deductibles and co-pays associated with the affordable care act, a trend by payers toward encouraging conservative disease management, and fda actions regarding the use of power morcellation in uterine surgeries which mostly impacted da vinci myomectomy procedures (see more detailed description of the fda actions concerning morcellation below). minimally invasive surgery is presently approaching 80% penetration of the u.s. benign hysterectomy market, causing the rate of migration from open surgeries to minimally invasive surgeries to slow. combined with the dispersion of the remaining open procedures among hospitals and surgeons, we believe the number of da vinci hysterectomies performed for benign conditions has moved roughly in-line with the gradually decreasing surgical market in 2014.
cholecystectomy.  in december 2011, we received fda clearance for single-site cholecystectomy, our first procedure cleared for single-site instruments.  since then, da vinci cholecystectomy has grown into our third largest procedure, after hysterectomy and prostatectomy.  da vinci cholecystectomies are performed with either single-site instruments or multiport instruments. in many cases, surgeons performing multiport cholecystectomies are using that approach as a training pathway towards single-site cholecystectomy or other more complex procedures.  cholecystectomy is a lower complexity procedure which can generally be executed in a minimally invasive manner via multiport laparoscopy and has lower reimbursement rates than more complex procedures.  for these reasons, it is difficult to estimate to what degree we may capture these procedures.  during 2014, total u.s. cholecystectomies grew at a lower percentage than in previous periods.
procedure seasonality. more than half of da vinci procedures performed are for benign conditions, most notably benign hysterectomies and cholecystectomies. the proportion of these benign procedures has grown over time in relation to the total number of procedures performed. hysterectomies for benign conditions, cholecystectomies, hernia repairs, and other short-term elective procedures tend to be more seasonal than cancer operations and surgeries for other life threatening conditions. seasonality for these benign procedures results in higher fourth quarter procedure volume when more patients have met annual deductibles and lower first quarter procedure volume when deductibles are reset. we experienced lower seasonality in 2014 which could be reflective of higher deductible insurance plans required by ppaca. it is possible that in the first quarter 2015, benign procedures will decline at a similar or greater rate than first quarter 2014 procedures declined from the fourth quarter of 2013 procedures. third quarter activity has historically been seasonally lower due to summer vacations, particularly in europe.
procedure mix. our procedure business is now comprised of: (1) cancer and other highly complex procedures and (2) less complex benign procedures. cancer and other highly complex procedures tend to be reimbursed at higher rates than less complex benign procedures. thus, hospitals are more sensitive to the costs associated with treating less complex benign conditions. our strategy is to provide hospitals with attractive clinical and economic solutions in each of these procedure categories. more fully featured products, including 4-arm, dual console, firefly enabled systems, and advanced instruments including vessel sealing and stapler are targeted towards more complex procedures. lower priced products, including the three-arm da vinci si-e system and lower priced single-site instruments are targeted towards less complex procedures.
40
fda actions concerning morcellation. in april 2014, the fda announced that it discourages the use of power morcellators in the surgical removal of assumed benign fibroids. this statement was followed in july 2014 by an fda panel discussion on the topic. in november 2014, the fda issued specific contraindications for the use of laparoscopic power morcellation and required specific patient warning prior to its use in surgery. we do not manufacture or sell power morcellation products and power morcellators do not attach to da vinci surgical systems. minimally invasive da vinci gynecologic surgeries are routinely performed without the use of power morcellators. however, we believe that these fda actions likely created some uncertainty for surgeons and patients when choosing among minimally invasive surgical methods for removing fibroids that may have adversely impacted the number of da vinci procedures performed. during the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2014 we experienced a decline in myomectomies that likely reflected the impact of the fda actions. myomectomies are not a significant portion of our business. it is difficult to gauge what impact the fda actions may have had on benign dvh procedures.
system demand future demand for da vinci surgical systems will be impacted by factors including procedure growth rates, market response to our recently launched da vinci xi surgical system, economic pressure and uncertainty at hospitals associated with the affordable care act, evolving system utilization and point of care dynamics, likely variability in the timing of japanese systems sales given that additional da vinci procedures are considered for reimbursement only in even numbered years and the possible approval of the xi system, the timing of when we receive regulatory clearance in our other international markets for our xi system and related instruments, as well as other economic and geopolitical factors.
recent media and lawsuits prior to and during the twelve months ended december 31, 2014, various print, television, and internet media have released pieces questioning the patient safety and efficacy associated with da vinci surgery, the cost of da vinci surgery relative to other disease management methods, and the adequacy of surgeon training and our sales and marketing practices. in addition, as further described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8, we are currently named as a defendant in approximately 102 individual product liability lawsuits and a multi-plaintiff product liability lawsuit filed on behalf of 20 patients who underwent da vinci surgery. plaintiffs' attorneys have been engaged in well-funded national advertising campaigns soliciting clients who have undergone da vinci surgery and claim to have suffered an injury, and we have seen a substantial increase in these claims. we believe that da vinci surgery continues to be a safe and effective surgical method, as supported by a substantial and growing number of scientific studies and peer reviewed papers. we also believe that we provide appropriate training on the use of the da vinci surgical system, consistent with our role as device manufacturer. however, the recent negative media publicity likely has and may continue to delay or adversely impact procedure adoption, system sales, and our revenue growth in future periods.
the increase in product liability claims coincided with national attorney advertising efforts seeking patients dissatisfied with da vinci surgery. in an effort to avoid the expense and distraction of defending multiple lawsuits, we entered into tolling agreements to pause the applicable statutes of limitations for the claims, and engaged in mediation efforts. the attorneys for the patients agreed to collect and supply medical records, operative notes and other necessary information from these patients to us. each claim was individually investigated. the collection and evaluation of the patients' medical information was laborious. for hundreds of the asserted claims, we have never received medical records. as patient records related to these claims were received, we and our legal counsel, assisted by independent medical consultants, reviewed and analyzed the large volumes of medical information that began to arrive in the fall of 2013. the completion of the evaluation of a significant number of these claims occurred during the first quarter of 2014 and continued throughout 2014.
during the year ended december 31, 2014, we recorded pre-tax charges of $82.4 million, of which $67.4 million, $9.6 million, and $5.4 million was recorded in the first, second, and fourth quarters of 2014, respectively, to reflect the estimated cost of settling a number of the product liability claims covered by the tolling agreements described below. the claims relate to alleged complications from surgeries performed with certain versions of monopolar curved scissor (mcs) instruments that included an mcs tip cover accessory that was the subject of a market withdrawal in 2012 and mcs instruments that were the subject of a recall in 2013.
our estimate of the anticipated cost of settling these claims is based on negotiations with attorneys for patients who have participated in a mediation process. to date, approximately 4,800 claims have been reviewed as part of that mediation process. of those, however, a substantial number have already been removed from the tolling agreement that covers the claims in the mediation process and plaintiffs' counsels have indicated to us that they no longer intend to pursue these claims. nonetheless, the claimants that have been removed from the tolling agreement remain free to pursue lawsuits against us and it is also possible that more claims will be made by other individuals who have undergone da vinci surgery and allege that they suffered injuries. it is further possible that the claimants who participate in the mediations, as well as those claimants who have not participated in negotiations, will pursue greater amounts in mediation or in a court of law. consequently, the final outcome of these claims is dependent on many variables that are difficult to predict and the ultimate cost associated with these product liability claims may be materially different than the amount of the current estimate and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our business,
41
financial condition, and results of operations or cash flows. although there is a reasonable possibility that a loss in excess of the amount recognized exists, we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amount recognized at this time. see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 for further details.
we submit reports to the fda for these claims as part of our post-market surveillance process. the fda publicly reports these claims on its maude database. on february 27, 2014, we submitted an alternative summary report (asr) to consolidate 1,406 of the product liability claims for surgeries spanning the period 2004 through the third quarter of 2013. on may 29, 2014, we submitted a second asr to consolidate 219 initial claims and amend 236 previous claims for surgeries spanning the period 2005 through the fourth quarter of 2013. on august 27, 2014, we submitted a third asr that included 441 initial claims and amended 204 previous claims for surgeries spanning from september 2005 through january 2014. during the time period of 2004 through december 2014, approximately 2.2 million surgeries were performed with the da vinci surgical system in the u.s.
mdr reporting criteria are described in fda regulations at 21 cfr part 806. an mdr report or any other information submitted by us to the fda is not necessarily an admission that the device caused or contributed to the reportable event. the february 27, 2014 asr contains information from attorneys who submitted claims of injury involving da vinci use in surgery. the vast majority of the alleged injuries in the asr are common complications associated with surgery, including minimally invasive and open surgical procedures. in the rare instances in which our records were able to confirm claims of a malfunction of the da vinci surgical system during a surgery, we filed a separate mdr. where a claim indicated a patient death, we filed a separate mdr. the asr excludes these individually reported death and malfunction events.
new product introductions da vinci xi surgical system. during april 2014, we launched our newest da vinci model, the da vinci xi, in the u.s. the da vinci xi can be used across a wide spectrum of minimally invasive surgical procedures, and has been optimized for multi-quadrant surgeries. the da vinci xi expands upon core da vinci features including wristed instruments, 3d-hd visualization, intuitive motion, and ergonomic design, while improving ease, and delivering several new features, including:
•   a new overhead instrument arm architecture designed to facilitate anatomical access from virtually any position.
•   a new endoscope digital architecture that creates a simpler, more compact design with improved vision definition and clarity.
•   an ability to attach the endoscope to any arm, providing flexibility for visualizing the surgical site.
•   smaller, thinner arms with newly designed joints that offer a greater range of motion than ever before.
•   longer instrument shafts designed to give surgeons greater operative reach.
with the da vinci xi, we now offer hospitals a broader line of da vinci surgical systems to match their surgical profile and patient care requirements. these include the da vinci si-e, a lower price system suited for surgeries requiring two instrument arms; the da vinci si, which has the capability of controlling three instrument arms; and the da vinci xi, which has four universal instrument arms that attach to a rotating overhead platform. we separately applied for fda clearance for the da vinci xi firefly, vessel sealer, and stapler products and have received clearance for these products between june and august of 2014. our single site line of instruments is only available for our da vinci si and da vinci si-e systems.
we ce marked the da vinci xi system in june 2014 and have begun sales and marketing activities in certain countries recognizing the ce mark. we are in various stages of applying for ce mark on other da vinci xi products, including firefly, vessel sealer, and stapler. we plan to bring these products to market upon receiving ce marks. in october 2014, we received regulatory clearance for our da vinci xi surgical system in korea. regulatory submissions have been made for the da vinci xi surgical system in japan with the status currently pending. the regulatory status of the da vinci xi surgical system in other international markets varies by country.
da vinci single-site instruments. da vinci single-site consists of a set of non-wristed instruments (except for wristed needle driver discussed below) and accessories that allow the da vinci si systems to work through a single incision, typically in the umbilicus, rather than multiple incisions. single incision surgery is intended to minimize invasiveness to patients by reducing the number of ports required to enter the body and is typically utilized for less complex surgery than multi-port surgery. non-robotic single incision surgery today is typically performed with modified laparoscopic instruments. early clinical adoption of this manual technique has been mostly positive, although physicians have reported that manual single incision surgery is technically and ergonomically challenging. da vinci single-site instruments and accessories were designed to address these issues. in february 2011, we received the ce mark for our da vinci single-site instrument kit and began selling these new products in europe. the majority of da vinci single-site procedures performed in europe to date have been cholecystectomies. in december 2011, we received fda regulatory clearance to market our single-site instrumentation in the u.s. for laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures. in february 2013, we received fda clearance to market our single-site instruments for benign hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy procedures. in september 2014, we received fda clearance to market the wristed version of our single-site needle driver product for use on benign hysterectomy, cholecystectomy, and salpingo-oophorectomy procedures. we believe

this instrument may have particular utility in benign hysterectomy procedures. however, as these are our initial products targeted towards procedures already highly penetrated by manual mis techniques, we are not able to predict the extent or pace that da vinci single-site may be adopted.
da vinci firefly fluorescence imaging. in the first quarter of 2011, we launched our firefly product for use with the da vinci si surgical system. firefly is a standard feature of the da vinci xi surgical system. this imaging capability combines a fluorescent dye with a specialized da vinci camera head, endoscope and laser-based illuminator to allow surgeons to identify vasculature in three dimensions beneath tissue surfaces to visualize critical anatomy. adoption of firefly is progressing with use across the categories of urology, gynecology and general surgery. in september 2013, we received fda 510(k) clearance to market our firefly fluorescence imaging product for real-time imaging of bile ducts (cystic duct, common bile duct, and common hepatic duct). we believe that the use of firefly during cholecystectomy procedures will enhance the ability of surgeons to identify key anatomical structures during the surgery.
endowrist one vessel sealer. in december 2011, we received fda clearance for the endowrist one vessel sealer. the endowrist one vessel sealer is a wristed, single-use instrument intended for bipolar coagulation and mechanical transection of vessels up to 7 mm in diameter and tissue bundles that fit in the jaws of the instrument. this instrument enables da vinci si surgeons to fully control vessel sealing, while providing the benefits of da vinci surgery. this instrument is designed to enhance surgical efficiency and autonomy in a variety of general surgery and gynecologic procedures. clinical response to the endowrist one vessel sealer has been encouraging, with positive commentary on precision, articulation, vessel sealing quality and thermal spread, and we expect applications for the endowrist one vessel sealer to be centered on general surgery and gynecologic oncology procedures. endowrist one vessel sealer utilization rates have increased steadily in 2013 and 2014. in june 2014, we received fda clearance for the da vinci xi version of the endowrist one vessel sealer.
endowrist stapler 45. in october 2012, we received fda clearance for the endowrist stapler 45 instrument with blue and green 45 mm reloads. the endowrist stapler 45 is a wristed, stapling instrument intended for resection, transection and/or creation of anastomoses in general, gynecologic and urologic surgery. this instrument enables operators of the da vinci si to precisely position and fire the stapler. its initial surgical use was directed towards colorectal procedures. during 2013, the endowrist stapler was used by a limited and gradually increasing number of customers. in 2014, we expanded the availability of the endowrist stapler to a broadening set of customers. in september 2014, we notified our customers to suspend the use of the endowrist stapler 45 (see recalls and corrections section for additional discussion). in january 2015, we began to ship the replacement product. although our early customer experiences have been positive, we are in the early stages of selling endowrist stapler 45, and we are not able to predict the extent to which the instrument may be adopted.

total revenue total revenue decreased by 6% during the year ended december 31, 2014 from the year ended december 31, 2013, and increased by 4% during the year ended december 31, 2013, from the year ended december 31, 2012. total revenue was $2.1 billion during the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to $2.3 billion during the year ended december 31, 2013, and $2.2 billion during the year ended december 31, 2012. the decline in total revenue for the year ended december 31, 2014, was driven by 24% lower sales of da vinci systems, largely reflecting lower system sales in the u.s. and japan, partially offset by 5% higher recurring instruments, accessories, and services revenue, resulting primarily from an approximately 9% higher procedure volume. the increase in total revenue for the year ended december 31, 2013, was driven by 15% higher recurring instruments, accessories, and services revenue, resulting primarily from approximately 16% higher procedure volume. the increase in recurring revenue during the year ended december 31, 2013 was partially offset by 11% lower sales of da vinci systems, largely reflecting lower da vinci system sales in the u.s.
revenue generated in the u.s. accounted for 70%, 72%, and 79% of total revenue during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. we believe that domestic revenue has accounted for the large majority of total revenue due to patients

ability to choose their provider and method of treatment in the u.s., reimbursement structures supportive of innovation and minimally invasive surgery, and initial investments focused on domestic infrastructure. our international revenue has grown faster in proportion to u.s. revenue primarily due to higher procedure growth rates in international markets and lower u.s. system sales.

product revenue product revenue decreased to $1.7 billion during the year ended december 31, 2014, from $1.9 billion during the year ended december 31, 2013.
instruments and accessories revenue increased to $1.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2014, up 4% compared with $1.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase in revenue was driven by an approximate 9% increase in procedure volume, partially offset by lower initial instrument and accessory stocking orders associated with lower 2014 system unit sales.
45
the growth in our overall procedure volume was driven by approximately 32% growth in u.s. general surgery procedures and approximately 12% growth in worldwide urologic procedures, partially offset by approximately 2% lower u.s. gynecologic procedures. higher u.s. general surgery procedures reflected growth in hernia repair, colorectal, cholecystectomy, and several other procedures.
systems revenue decreased to $632.5 million during the year ended december 31, 2014, down 24% from $834.9 million during the year ended december 31, 2013, primarily due to lower u.s. and japanese da vinci surgical system unit shipments, partially offset by higher da vinci surgical system unit shipments into europe and other international markets. during 2014, 238 systems were shipped into the u.s., 97 into europe, 37 into japan, and 59 into other markets, compared with 342 systems shipped into the u.s., 82 into europe, 79 into japan, and 43 into other markets in 2013. the demand for systems is ultimately driven by da vinci surgical procedure volume and is highly sensitive to changes in procedure growth rates. the decline in u.s. system sales in 2014 was largely driven by moderating procedure growth (as described in the procedures section) resulting in lower need for customers to expand capacity, economic pressure and uncertainty at hospitals associated with the affordable care act, and evolving system utilization and point of care dynamics. the decrease in system sales in japan likely reflect the fact that only prostatectomies are broadly reimbursed and the effect of a possible approval of the xi system. the increase in system sales in europe reflects continued procedure growth and investments we have made in our european sales and marketing organizations.
the da vinci surgical system average selling price ("asp"), excluding the impact of units shipped under operating leases, was fairly consistent at $1.5 million for 2014 and 2013.
product revenue increased to $1.9 billion during the year ended december 31, 2013, from $1.8 billion during the year ended december 31, 2012.
instruments and accessories revenue increased to $1,032.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, up 14% compared with $903.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. the increase in revenue was driven by an approximate 16% increase in procedure volume and, to a lesser extent, higher initial instrument and accessory orders associated with recently released products, including da vinci single-site, the endowrist one vessel sealer, and firefly fluorescence imaging products, partially offset by lower initial instrument and accessory stocking orders associated with lower 2013 system units sales and procedure mix.
the growth in our 2013 overall procedure volume was driven by growth in u.s. general surgery procedures, u.s. gynecologic procedures and international urology procedures, partially offset by a decline of approximately 6% in u.s. dvp procedures.
systems revenue decreased to $834.9 million during the year ended december 31, 2013, down 11% from $932.9 million during the year ended december 31, 2012, primarily due to lower u.s. da vinci surgical system unit sales, partially offset by higher international system unit sales. during 2013, 342 systems were sold into the u.s., 82 into europe, 79 into japan, and 43 into other markets, compared with 476 systems sold into the u.s., 64 into europe, 40 into japan, and 40 into other markets in 2012. the demand for systems is ultimately driven by da vinci surgical procedure volume and is highly sensitive to changes in procedure growth rates. the decline in u.s. system sales in 2013 was largely driven by moderating growth in the category benign gynecologic procedures resulting in fewer systems sales required to be sold into the installed base to expand capacity. in addition, hospital capital spending appears to have been impacted by strategic uncertainties surrounding the affordable care act, economic pressures, and negative media reports.
the da vinci surgical system asp was fairly consistent at $1.5 million for 2013 and 2012.
service revenue service revenue, comprised primarily of system service and customer training, increased 8% to $429.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2014, from $397.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. service revenue increased 16% to $397.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2013, from $342.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. we typically enter into multi-year service fixed annual rate contracts at the time systems are sold. these service contracts have been generally renewed at the end of the service periods. higher service revenue in 2014 and 2013 was driven by a larger installed base of da vinci surgical systems producing service contract revenue.
gross profit product gross profit during the year ended december 31, 2014, decreased 14% to $1.1 billion, or 66.5% of product revenue, compared with $1.3 billion, or 70.9% of product revenue, during the year ended december 31, 2013. the lower 2014 gross profit was driven by lower 2014 product revenue as described above and a lower 2014 gross product profit margin. the lower 2014 gross profit margin was driven by a higher proportion of 2014 sales of recently introduced products that yield lower gross margin percentages, including the da vinci xi surgical system, as well as the endowrist one vessel sealer and the endowrist stapler. margins on newly launched products will typically be lower than our mature products reflecting vendor pricing on low volumes, temporary tooling costs and other start-up costs. over time, as volumes increase, and we refine the manufacturing processes and products, we expect to see improvement in the margins of these newer products. however, gross margins may ultimately differ for these newer products relative to our previous products based on market conditions, volume, and complexity of the product.
46
other factors contributing to the lower 2014 product gross profit margin were a higher proportion of sales involving trade-in's and higher credits given for those trade-ins, higher 2014 incentive compensation, and higher product recall costs.
product gross profit for the year ended december 31, 2014, and 2013 reflected share-based compensation expense of $19.1 million and $17.6 million, respectively. product gross profit for the years ended december 31, 2014, and 2013 included $15.7 million and $21.0 million, respectively, related to the u.s. medical device excise tax, which became effective january 1, 2013.
service gross profit during the year ended december 31, 2014, increased to $281.0 million, or 65.5% of service revenue, compared with $269.8 million, or 67.9% of service revenue during the year ended december 31, 2013. the higher 2014 service gross profit was driven by higher service revenue. the lower 2014 gross service profit margin was primarily driven by costs added to support the newly introduced da vinci xi system and higher incentive compensation. service gross profit during the years ended december 31, 2014, and 2013, reflected share-based compensation expense of $13.5 million and $12.7 million, respectively.
product gross profit during the year ended december 31, 2013, decreased 1% to $1.3 billion, or 70.9% of product revenue, compared with $1.3 billion, or 73.0% of product revenue, during the year ended december 31, 2012. the lower 2013 product gross margin largely reflected the impact of the new u.s. medical device excise tax and lower gross margins earned on recently released instrument and accessory products. 2013 product revenue included a higher proportion of recently introduced instrument and accessory products which yield lower gross margin percentages, particularly single-site instruments and the endowrist one vessel sealer. margins on newly launched products will typically be lower than our mature products reflecting vendor pricing on low volumes, temporary tooling costs and other start-up costs. over time, as volumes increase, and we refine the manufacturing processes and products, we expect to see improvement in the margins of these newer products. however, gross margins may ultimately differ for these newer products relative to our previous products based market conditions, volume, and complexity of the product. product gross profit for the year ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, reflected share-based compensation expense of $17.6 million and $14.1 million, respectively.
service gross profit during the year ended december 31, 2013, increased to $269.8 million, or 67.9% of service revenue, compared with $229.4 million, or 67.0% of service revenue during the year ended december 31, 2012. the higher 2013 service gross profit was driven by higher service revenue as described above. the higher 2013 gross service profit margin was primarily driven by lower service parts consumption rates. service gross profit during the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, reflected share-based compensation expense of $12.7 million and $12.9 million, respectively.
selling, general and administrative expenses selling, general and administrative expenses include costs for sales, marketing and administrative personnel, sales and marketing activities, tradeshow expenses, legal expenses, regulatory fees and general corporate expenses.
selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2014 increased 20% to $691.0 million compared to $574.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase was primarily due to a pre-tax charge of $82.4 million of which $67.4 million, $9.6 million, and $5.4 million was recorded in the first, second, and fourth quarters of 2014, respectively, to reflect the estimated cost of settling a number of the product liability claims covered by tolling agreements outlined above. in addition, selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2014, also increased due to higher legal costs related to the pending or threatened litigation, expansion of our japanese and other international organizations, higher regulatory compliance costs, and higher incentive compensation. share-based compensation expense charged to selling, general and administrative expenses during the years ended december 31, 2014, and 2013, were $99.0 million and $101.4 million, respectively.
selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31, 2013, increased 10% to $574.0 million compared to $522.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. the increase was primarily due to organizational growth to support our expanding business, particularly in the clinical field sales function, regulatory activity, and higher legal costs related to pending or threatened litigation, and higher share-based compensation expenses, partially offset by lower employee incentive costs. share-based compensation expense charged to selling, general and administrative expenses during the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012 were $101.4 million and $93.1 million, respectively.
research and development expenses research and development costs are expensed as incurred. research and development expenses include costs associated with the design, development, testing and significant enhancement of our products. these enhancements represent significant improvements to our products.
research and development expenses during the year ended december 31, 2014, increased 6% to $178.0 million compared to $167.7 million during the year ended december 31, 2013. the increase was driven by higher headcount and incentive compensation expenses. share-based compensation expense charged to research and development expense during the years ended december 31, 2014, and 2013, were $37.5 million and $37.2 million, respectively. amortization expense related to purchased intellectual property during the years ended december 31, 2014, and 2013, were $11.6 million and $10.8 million, respectively. we expect to continue
47
to make substantial investments in research and development and anticipate that research and development expenses, including co-development arrangements with industry partners, will increase in the future.
research and development expenses during the year ended december 31, 2013, decreased 1% to $167.7 million compared to $170.0 million during the year ended december 31, 2012. the decrease was due to lower 2013 incentive compensation, amortization of intangible assets, and prototype expenses, partly offset by higher share-based compensation. share-based compensation expense charged to research and development expense during the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, was $37.2 million and $33.2 million, respectively. amortization expense related to purchased intellectual property during the years ended december 31, 2013, and 2012, were $10.8 million and $13.8 million, respectively.
interest and other income, net interest and other income, net, was $4.2 million during the year ended december 31, 2014, compared to $18.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2013. lower interest and other income, net for the year ended december 31, 2014, was driven by lower 2014 interest income on lower investment balances and $8.5 million in charges recorded related to the impairment of two equity investments.
interest and other income, net, was $18.4 million during the year ended december 31, 2013, compared to $15.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2012. higher interest and other income, net for the year ended december 31, 2013, was driven by higher 2013 interest income earned.
income tax expense our income tax expense was $130.2 million, $199.9 million, and $237.3 million during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. the effective tax rate for 2014 was approximately 23.7% compared with 23.0% for 2013, and 26.5% for 2012. our tax rates for all these periods differed from the u.s. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to income earned by certain of our overseas entities being taxed at rates lower than the federal statutory rate and the reversal of unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by state income taxes net of federal benefit. we intend to indefinitely reinvest all of our undistributed foreign earnings that were not previously subject to u.s. tax in activities outside the u.s. our 2014, 2013, and 2012 tax provision reflected net tax benefits of $20.3 million, $26.7 million, and $38.0 million, respectively, associated with the reversal of unrecognized tax benefits and interests resulting from expiration of statutes of limitations in multiple jurisdictions and certain audit settlements. our 2014 tax provision included a net tax benefit of $5.0 million related to the federal research and development ("r&d") credit which was reinstated in december 2014. our 2013 tax provision included a net tax benefit of $4.7 million for the 2013 federal r&d credit and a net tax benefit of $8.2 million related to 2012 federal r&d credit as the federal r&d credit was retroactively reinstated during the first quarter of 2013. our 2012 tax provision did not reflect any benefit from federal r&d credit but reflected $8.5 million in benefits related to certain previously unrecognized tax benefits and associated interest as a result of new irs guidance issued in the first quarter of 2012.
a valuation allowance has been recorded against our california deferred tax assets because it is more likely than not these deferred tax assets will not be realized as a result of the computation of california taxes under the single sales factor. we will continue to monitor and reassess the need for further increases or decreases to the valuation allowance. as of december 31, 2014, and 2013, we had valuation allowances of $9.5 million and $7.2 million, respectively, primarily on california deferred tax assets.
the u.s. internal revenue service ("irs") completed its audit of our 2010 and 2011 federal income tax returns in december 2014. at the conclusion of the audit, the irs provided its revenue agent's report to the joint committee of taxation, which agreed with the irs examiner's report with no exceptions. as a result, we released reserves in connection with years 2010 and 2011 in the fourth quarter of 2014, which were included in the $20.3 million reversal of unrecognized tax benefits and interests described above. in addition, we anticipate receiving a refund of $4.5 million in 2015 in connection with the conclusion of the audit.
we file federal, state and foreign income tax returns in many jurisdictions in the u.s. and abroad. generally, years before 2010 are closed for most significant jurisdictions except for california, for which years before 2008 are considered closed. we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities and the outcome of these audits cannot be predicted with certainty.
certain of our unrecognized tax benefits could reverse based on the normal expiration of various statutes of limitations, which could affect our effective tax rate in the period in which they reverse. management regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. if any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.
48
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash our principal source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and issuance of common stock through exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase program. cash and cash equivalents plus short and long-term investments decreased from $2.9 billion at december 31, 2012, to $2.8 billion at december 31, 2013, and to $2.5 billion at december 31, 2014. cash generation is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting our operating, investing, and financing needs. the decreases in cash and investments generally reflect cash used for stock repurchases and capital expenditures partially offset by cash flow from operations.
as of december 31, 2014, $766.7 million of our cash, cash equivalents and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries. amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to u.s. income taxation on repatriation to the u.s. we currently have no plans to repatriate any foreign earnings back to the u.s. as we believe our cash flows provided by our u.s. operations will meet our u.s. liquidity needs.

operating activities during the year ended december 31, 2014, cash flow from operations of $665.1 million exceeded our net income of $418.8 million for two primary reasons:
1.   our net income included substantial non-cash charges primarily in the form of share-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, taxes, and depreciation. these non-cash charges totaled $232.1 million during the year ended december 31, 2014.
2.   changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in approximately $14.2 million in cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december 31, 2014.
operating assets and liabilities are comprised primarily of accounts receivable, inventory, deferred revenue, other accrued liabilities, and prepaid expenses. accrued liabilities increased by $63.4 million, mainly driven by an increase in product liability accruals. deferred revenue, which includes deferred service revenue that is being recognized as revenue over the service contract period, increased by $19.8 million in 2014 primarily due to the increase in the number of installed systems for which service contracts existed. also, accrued compensation and accounts payable increased by $39.1 million. the favorable impact of these items on cash provided by operating activities was partly offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $13.7 million in 2014 reflecting timing of our system sales and related collections, a net increase in inventory of $26.8 million primarily due to expanded product offerings, and an increase in prepaids and other assets of $67.6 million, primarily driven by timing of tax payments and an increase in lease receivables relating to sales-type lease arrangements entered into during fiscal 2014.
during the year ended december 31, 2013, cash flow from operations of $880.0 million exceeded our net income of $671.0 million for two primary reasons:
1.   our net income included substantial non-cash charges in the form of share-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, taxes, and depreciation. these non-cash charges totaled $231.0 million during the year ended december 31, 2013.
2.   changes in operating assets and liabilities resulting in cash used in operating activities during the year ended december 31, 2013 was approximately $22.0 million.
49
operating assets and liabilities are comprised primarily of accounts receivable, inventory, deferred revenue and other liabilities. accounts receivable decreased by $68.9 million, or 19%, in 2013 reflecting timing of our system sales. inventory increased by $58.1 million, or 48%, in 2013 due to expanded product offerings and safety stocks acquired for key components. deferred revenue, which includes deferred service revenue that is being recognized as revenue over the service contract period, increased $15.3 million, or 8%, in 2013 primarily due to the increase in the number of installed systems for which service contracts exist. other liabilities including accounts payable, accrued compensation and employee benefits, and accrued liabilities decreased by $35.1 million in 2013 primarily due to timing of vendor, tax and employee compensation payments during 2013.
during the year ended december 31, 2012, cash flow from operations of $814.2 million exceeded our net income of $656.6 million for two primary reasons:
1.   our net income included substantial non-cash charges in the form of share-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, taxes and depreciation. these non-cash charges totaled $223.1 million during the year ended december 31, 2012.
2.   changes in operating assets and liabilities resulting in cash used in operating activities during the year ended december 31, 2012 was approximately $65.5 million.
operating assets and liabilities are comprised primarily of accounts receivable, inventory, deferred revenue and other liabilities. accounts receivable increased by $68.9 million, or 24%, in 2012 reflecting timing of our system sales. inventory increased by $7.1 million, or 8%, in 2012 due to our business growth, expanded product offerings, and safety stocks acquired for key components. deferred revenue, which includes deferred service contract revenue that is being amortized over the service contract period, increased $30.5 million, or 20%, in 2012 primarily due to the increase in the number of installed systems for which service contracts exist. other liabilities including accounts payable, accrued compensation and employee benefits, and accrued liabilities increased by $17.1 million in 2012 primarily due to timing of vendor, tax and employee compensation payments during 2012.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31, 2014, consisted primarily of cash used for purchases of property and equipment of $105.6 million and purchases of businesses of $84.3 million, partially offset by the proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments (net of purchases of investments) of $36.0 million. purchases of property included the acquisition of approximately 15 acres of land in sunnyvale, california for future expansion. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we acquired certain intellectual property, know-how, fixed assets, and employees from luna and we reacquired the japan distribution rights from adachi.
net cash provided by investing activities during the year ended december 31, 2013, consisted primarily of proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments (net of purchases of investments) of $363.6 million, less purchases of property and equipment and licensing of intellectual property of $104.6 million.
net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december 31, 2012, consisted primarily of purchases of investments (net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments) of $703.9 million less purchases of property and equipment and licensing of intellectual property of $114.2 million. we invest predominantly in high quality, fixed income securities. our investment portfolio may at any time contain investments in u.s. treasury and u.s. government agency securities, taxable and/or tax exempt municipal notes, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, cash deposits and money market funds.
financing activities net cash used in financing activities in 2014 consisted primarily of $1.0 billion used for the repurchase of 2.5 million shares of our common stock through an accelerated share repurchase program, offset by proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases of $283.6 million and excess tax benefits of $24.0 million. net cash used in financing activities in 2013 consisted primarily of $1.1 billion used for the repurchase of 2.6 million shares of our common stock, offset by proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases of $160.6 million and excess tax benefits of $38.0 million. net cash proceeds provided by financing activities in 2012 consisted primarily of stock option exercises and employee stock purchases of $263.3 million and excess tax benefits of $94.2 million, offset by $238.3 million used for the repurchase of 0.4 million shares of our common stock through open market transactions.
our cash requirements depend on numerous factors, including market acceptance of our products, the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products and other factors. we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to expand procedure adoption and acceptance of our products. we have made substantial investments in our commercial operations, product development activities, facilities and intellectual property. based upon our business model, we anticipate that we will continue to be able to fund future growth through cash provided from operations. we believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, together with income to be derived from the sale of our products, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements beyond one year and for the foreseeable future.

operating leases. we lease office spaces in the u.s., switzerland, mexico, japan, brazil, china, and korea. we also lease automobiles for certain sales and field service employees. operating lease amounts include future minimum lease payments under all our non-cancellable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year.
purchase commitments and obligations. these amounts include an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, including commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services and acquisition and licensing of intellectual property. a majority of these purchase obligations are due within a year. although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services. in addition to the above, we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing, collaboration and development arrangements. payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and have not been included in the table above.
other commitments. we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when payments may occur for our unrecognized tax benefits. therefore, our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is not included in the table above.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2014, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of sec regulation s-k promulgated under the exchange act.
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("u.s. gaap"), which requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions. see "note 2. summary of significant accounting policies," in notes to the consolidated financial statements, which is included in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data," which describes our significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. the methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. our most critical accounting estimates include:
•   the valuation and recognition of investments, which impacts our investment portfolio balance when we assess fair value, and interest and other income, net, when we record impairments;
•   the valuation of revenue and allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts, which impacts revenue;
•   the estimation of transactions to hedge, which impacts revenue and other expense;
•   the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross profit margins;
•   the assessment of recoverability of intangible assets and their estimated useful lives, which primarily impacts gross profit margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their amortization;
•   the valuation and recognition of share-based compensation, which impacts gross profit margin and operating expenses;
•   the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impact our provision for taxes; and
•   the estimate of probable loss associated with product liability claims, which impacts accrued liabilities and operating expenses.

investments valuation fair value our investment portfolio may at any time contain investments in u.s. treasury and u.s. government agency securities, taxable and/or tax exempt municipal notes (some of which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, cash deposits and money market funds. in the current market environment, the assessment of the fair value of investments can be difficult and subjective. u.s. gaap establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value. valuation of level 1 and 2 instruments generally do not require significant management judgment and the estimation is not difficult. level 3 instruments include unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  the determination of fair value for level 3 instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity. during the year ended december 31, 2014, the level 3 securities were redeemed. there were no other level 3 securities as of december 31, 2014.
other-than-temporary impairment after determining the fair value of our available-for-sales instruments, gains or losses on these securities are recorded to other comprehensive income, until either the security is sold or we determine that the decline in value is other-than-temporary. the primary differentiating factors we considered in classifying impairments as either temporary or other-than-temporary impairments are our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value, the length of the time and the extent to which the market value of the investment has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer. given the current market conditions, these judgments could prove to be wrong, and companies with relatively high credit ratings and solid financial conditions may not be able to fulfill their obligations.
during the year ended december 31, 2014, we recorded pre-tax losses of $8.5 million related to a decline in the value of two equity investments that we concluded were other-than-temporary. no significant impairment charges were recorded during the years ended december 31, 2013, and 2012. as of december 31, 2014, and 2013, net unrealized losses on investments of $0.2 million, net of tax and net unrealized gains on investments of $1.7 million, net of tax, respectively, were included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts. we record estimated reductions in revenue for potential returns of products by customers and other allowances. as a result, management must make estimates of potential future product returns and other allowances related to current period product revenue. in making such estimates, management analyzes historical returns, current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products. if management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates, material differences in the amount of reported revenue could result.
similarly, we make estimates of the collectibility of accounts receivable, especially analyzing the aging and nature of accounts receivable and historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends, and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. credit evaluations are undertaken for all major sale transactions before shipment is authorized. on a quarterly basis, we evaluate aged items in the accounts receivable aging report and provide an allowance in an amount we deem adequate for doubtful accounts. if management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates, material differences in the amount of our reported operating expenses could result.
hedge accounting for derivatives. we utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency sales transactions. when specific criteria required by relevant accounting standards have been met, changes in fair values of hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income ("oci") rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income. by their nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. when we determine that the transactions are no longer probable within a certain time-frame, we are required to reclassify the cumulative changes in the fair values of the related hedge contracts from oci to net income.
inventory valuation. inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. the cost basis of our inventory is reduced for any products that are considered excessive or obsolete based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations.
intangible assets. our intangible assets include identifiable intangibles and goodwill. identifiable intangibles include developed technology, patents, distribution rights, customer relationships, and licenses. all of our identifiable intangibles have finite lives. goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to an annual impairment review (or more frequent if impairment indicators arise) by applying a fair-value based test. there have been no impairments from the analysis required by u.s. gaap.
52
identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are subject to impairment testing and are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value. we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of these identifiable intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated from such assets. if the cash flow estimates or the significant operating assumptions upon which they are based change in the future, we may be required to record additional impairment charges.
the valuation and classification of intangible assets and goodwill and the assignment of useful lives for purposes of amortization involves judgments and the use of estimates. the evaluation of these intangibles and goodwill for impairment under established accounting guidelines is required on a recurring basis. changes in business conditions could potentially require future adjustments to the assumptions made. when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of amortization over the assets' new, shorter useful lives. no impairment charge or accelerated amortization was recorded for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012. a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing impairment, which includes financial forecasts. should conditions be different from management's current estimates, material write-downs of long-lived assets may be required, which would adversely affect our operating results.
revenue recognition. our system sale arrangements contain multiple elements, including system(s), system accessories, instruments, accessories, and system service. we generally deliver all of the elements, other than service, within days of entering into the system sale arrangement. each of these elements is a separate unit of accounting. system accessories, instruments, accessories, and service are also sold on a stand-alone basis.
for multiple-element arrangements, revenue is allocated to each unit of accounting based on their relative selling prices. relative selling prices are based first on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value ("vsoe"), then on third-party evidence of selling price ("tpe") when vsoe does not exist, and then on management's best estimate of the selling price ("esp") when vsoe and tpe do not exist.
our system sale arrangements generally include a one-year period of free service, and the right for the customer to purchase service annually after that for up to four years at a stated service price. the revenue allocated to the free service period is deferred and recognized ratably over the free service period.
because we have neither vsoe nor tpe for our systems, the allocation of revenue is based on esp for the systems sold. the objective of esp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale, had the product been sold on a stand-alone basis. we determine esp for our systems by considering multiple factors, including, but not limited to, features and functionality of the system, geographies, type of customer, and market conditions. we regularly review esp and maintain internal controls over establishing and updating these estimates.
accounting for stock options. we account for share-based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of u.s. gaap. we use the black-scholes-merton option-pricing model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions. these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them, the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term, and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements. the assumptions for expected volatility and expected term are the two assumptions that most significantly affect the grant date fair value of stock options. changes in expected risk-free rate of return do not significantly impact the calculation of fair value, and determining this input is not highly subjective.
we use implied volatility based on freely traded options in the open market, as we believe implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility. in determining the appropriateness of relying on implied volatility, we considered the following:
•   the sufficiency of the trading volume of freely traded options;
•   the ability to reasonably match the terms, such as the date of the grant and the exercise price of the freely traded options to options granted; and
•   the length of the term of the freely traded options used to derive implied volatility.
the expected term represents the weighted-average period that our stock options are expected to be outstanding. the expected term is based on the observed and expected time to exercise. we determine expected term based on historical exercise patterns and our expectation of the time it will take for employees to exercise options still outstanding.
u.s. gaap requires us to develop an estimate of the number of share-based awards that will be forfeited due to employee turnover. adjustments in the estimated forfeiture rates can have a significant effect on our reported share-based compensation, as we recognize the cumulative effect of the rate adjustments for all expense amortization in the period the estimated forfeiture rates were adjusted. we estimate and adjust forfeiture rates based on a periodic review of recent forfeiture activity and expected future employee turnover. if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than previously estimated forfeiture rate, we may make an adjustment that will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements during the period when the rate was changed. adjustments in the estimated forfeiture rates could also cause changes in the amount of expense that we recognize in future periods.
53
changes in these subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock options and, consequently, the related amount of share-based compensation expense recognized on the consolidated statements of income.
accounting for income taxes. significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets in accordance with u.s. gaap. these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in the current or subsequent period.
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. if recovery is less than a 50% likelihood, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be recoverable. as of december 31, 2014, we believe it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets ultimately will be recovered with the exception of our california deferred tax assets. we believe that due to the computation of california taxes under the single sale factor, it is more likely than not that our california deferred tax assets will not be realized. should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would be affected in the period in which such change takes place.
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. if we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit, then the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. we re-evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. this evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effective settlement of audit issues, and new audit activity. such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.
accounting for legal contingencies. we are involved in a number of legal proceedings involving product liability, intellectual property, shareholder derivative actions, securities class actions, and other matters. we record a liability and related charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements for legal contingencies when the loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. our assessment is reevaluated each accounting period and is based on all available information, including discussion with any outside legal counsel that represents us. if a reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss cannot be made, but a range of probable losses can be estimated, the low-end of the range of losses is recognized if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other. if a loss is reasonably possible, but not probable and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
when determining the estimated probable loss or range of losses, significant judgment is required to be exercised in order to estimate the amount and timing of the loss to be recorded. estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation are inherently difficult to make, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages with incomplete facts and information. the final outcome of legal proceedings is dependent on many variables difficult to predict, and therefore, the ultimate cost to entirely resolve such matters may be materially different than the amount of current estimates. consequently, new information or changes in judgments and estimates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations or cash flows. see note 7 commitments and contingencies for discussion of the charges recorded during fiscal 2014 related to our best estimate of probable loss associated with product liability claims.

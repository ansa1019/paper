item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
description of merck's business merck & co., inc. ("merck" or the "company") is a global health care company that delivers innovative health solutions through its prescription medicines, vaccines, biologic therapies and animal health products, which it markets directly and through its joint ventures. the company's operations are principally managed on a products basis and are comprised of three operating segments, which are the pharmaceutical, animal health and alliances segments, and one reportable segment, which is the pharmaceutical segment. the pharmaceutical segment includes human health pharmaceutical and vaccine products marketed either directly by the company or through joint ventures. human health pharmaceutical products consist of therapeutic and preventive agents, generally sold by prescription, for the treatment of human disorders. the company sells these human health pharmaceutical products primarily to drug wholesalers and retailers, hospitals, government agencies and managed health care providers such as health maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefit managers and other institutions. vaccine products consist of preventive pediatric, adolescent and adult vaccines, primarily administered at physician offices. the company sells these human health vaccines primarily to physicians, wholesalers, physician distributors and government entities. the company also has animal health operations that discover, develop, manufacture and market animal health products, including vaccines, which the company sells to veterinarians, distributors and animal producers. on october 1, 2014, the company divested its consumer care segment that developed, manufactured and marketed over-the-counter, foot care and sun care products.
overview during 2014, merck continued to execute its multi-year initiative to sharpen its commercial and research and development focus, redesign its operating model and reduce its cost base while remaining focused on innovation. the company received approval for six products in the united states in 2014, including u.s. food and drug administration ("fda") approval for keytruda for the treatment of advanced melanoma in patients whose disease has progressed after other therapies, belsomra for the treatment of insomnia, and gardasil 9, a nine-valent human papillomavirus ("hpv") vaccine. merck also enhanced its pipeline with external innovation, including the 2014 acquisitions of idenix pharmaceuticals, inc. ("idenix"), a company engaged in the discovery and development of next-generation treatments for hepatitis c virus ("hcv"), and oncoethix, a privately held biotechnology company specializing in oncology drug development. in addition, merck announced the acquisition of cubist pharmaceuticals, inc. ("cubist"), a leader in the development of new therapies to treat serious and potentially life-threatening infections caused by a broad range of increasingly drug-resistant bacteria, which closed in january 2015. also, in 2014, merck entered into a worldwide collaboration with bayer ag ("bayer") to market and develop novel therapies for cardiovascular disease and other therapeutic indications.
as part of merck's prioritization efforts, the company continued to review its assets to determine whether they could provide the best short- and longer-term value with merck or elsewhere. as a result, the company divested its consumer care ("mcc") business to bayer, which provided capital to the company to better resource its core areas of focus and return cash to shareholders. merck determined that its animal health business remains a key growth driver and is committed to looking for ways to augment this business. as part of its intensified portfolio assessment process, the company sold the u.s. marketing rights for saphris, an antipsychotic indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar i disorder in adults, and divested certain ophthalmic products in japan and markets in europe and asia pacific. the company's portfolio assessment process is ongoing and future divestitures may occur.
worldwide sales were $42.2 billion in 2014, a decline of 4% compared with 2013, including a 1% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. the decline reflects lower revenue resulting from the ongoing impacts of product divestitures and the loss of market exclusivity for several products, as well as the termination of the company's relationship with astrazeneca lp ("azlp") and the divestiture of mcc. in addition, lower sales of products for the treatment of hcv also contributed to the sales decline. these declines were partially offset by growth in immunology, acute care, diabetes, and vaccine products, as well as higher sales from merck's animal health business.
within the core human pharmaceutical and vaccine business, merck will continue to support its in-line portfolio, as well as ongoing and upcoming product launches. in 2014, the fda granted accelerated approval for keytruda, the company's anti-pd-1 (programmed death receptor-1) therapy for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and disease progression following ipilimumab and, if braf v600 mutation positive, a braf inhibitor. keytruda is currently under review in the european union (the "eu") for the treatment of
36
advanced melanoma. merck expects to submit a supplemental biologics license application ("sbla") to the fda for keytruda for the treatment of patients with epidermal growth factor receptor mutation-negative, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearrangement-negative non-small-cell lung cancer whose disease has progressed on or following platinum-based chemotherapy in mid-year 2015. keytruda continues to be studied in more than 30 cancers and in 20 combination settings, and merck has presented data in a number of different tumor types (see "research and development" below).
in addition, the fda approved belsomra for the treatment of adults with insomnia who have difficulty falling asleep and/or staying asleep, gardasil 9, a nine-valent hpv vaccine, and zontivity, a protease-activated receptor-1 (par-1) antagonist for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with a history of myocardial infarction or with peripheral arterial disease. also, in december 2014 prior to the company's acquisition of cubist, the fda approved cubist's zerbaxa, a new combination product for the treatment of adults with complicated urinary tract infections caused by designated susceptible gram-negative organisms or with complicated intra-abdominal infections caused by designated susceptible gram-negative and gram-positive organisms.
additionally, the company currently has candidates under review with the fda: mk-8616, bridion (sugammadex) injection, a medication for the reversal of two types of neuromuscular blocking agents used during surgery; and v419, an investigational pediatric hexavalent vaccine that the company is developing in partnership with sanofi pasteur designed to help protect against six important diseases - diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), polio (poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3), invasive disease caused by haemophilus influenzae type b (hib), and hepatitis b. in addition, zerbaxa is under review in the eu.
as a result of prioritizing its research efforts, merck is focused on the therapeutic areas that it believes can make the most impact on addressing critical areas of unmet medical need, such as cancer, hepatitis c, cardiometabolic disease, resistant microbial infection and alzheimer's disease. in 2014, merck accelerated several of its key clinical programs, positioning the company for long-term growth. the company now has more than 10 candidates in phase 3 clinical development in its core therapeutic areas, as well as other areas with significant potential. mk-5172a, an all-oral combination regimen consisting of mk-5172, grazoprevir, an investigational hcv ns3/4a protease inhibitor, and mk-8742, elbasvir, an investigational hcv ns5a replication complex inhibitor, is currently in phase 3 clinical trials. the company expects to file a new drug application ("nda") with the fda in the first half of 2015 for mk-5172a.
as a result of portfolio prioritization, the company is out-licensing or discontinuing selected late-stage clinical development assets and reducing its focus on platform technologies. during 2014, the company out-licensed mk-3222 (tildrakizumab), an investigational treatment for chronic plaque psoriasis, and divested its sirna therapeutics, inc. subsidiary and related rnai technology assets.
the company made strong progress in 2014 redesigning its operating model and reducing its cost base. as a result of disciplined cost management, merck remains on track to achieve its overall savings goal by the end of 2015. as noted above, these savings have enabled the company to better target its resources to key priorities across the enterprise. marketing and administrative expenses and research and development costs were down in 2014 as compared with 2013 reflecting lower selling and promotional spending and lower costs as a result of portfolio prioritization.
in 2013, the company announced a global restructuring program (the "2013 restructuring program") as part of its global initiative to sharpen its commercial and research and development focus. as part of the program, the company expects to reduce its total workforce by approximately 8,500 positions. these workforce reductions will primarily come from the elimination of positions in sales, administrative and headquarters organizations, as well as research and development. the company will also reduce its global real estate footprint and continue to improve the efficiency of its manufacturing and supply network. the company recorded total pretax costs of $1.2 billion in both 2014 and 2013 related to this restructuring program. the actions under the 2013 restructuring program are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2015 with the cumulative pretax costs estimated to be approximately $3.0 billion. the company expects the actions under the 2013 restructuring program to result in annual net cost savings of approximately $2.0 billion by the end of 2015. the company anticipates that the actions under the 2013 restructuring program, combined with remaining actions under the merger restructuring program (discussed below), will result in annual net cost savings of $2.5 billion by the end of 2015 compared with full-year 2012 expense levels.
the global restructuring program (the "merger restructuring program") that was initiated in 2010 subsequent to the merck and schering-plough corporation ("schering-plough") merger (the "merger") is intended to
37
streamline the cost structure of the combined company. the workforce reductions associated with this plan relate to the elimination of positions in sales, administrative and headquarters organizations, as well as from the sale or closure of certain manufacturing and research and development sites and the consolidation of office facilities. the company recorded total pretax costs of $730 million in 2014, $1.1 billion in 2013 and $951 million in 2012 related to this restructuring program. the non-manufacturing related restructuring actions under the merger restructuring program were substantially completed by the end of 2013. the remaining actions under this program relate to ongoing manufacturing facility rationalizations, which are expected to be substantially completed by 2016. the company expects the estimated total cumulative pretax costs for this program to be approximately $8.5 billion and to yield annual savings upon completion of the program of approximately $4.0 billion to $4.6 billion.
costs associated with the company's restructuring actions are included in materials and production costs, marketing and administrative expenses, research and development expenses and restructuring costs. the company estimates that of the projected costs associated with the above mentioned restructuring programs, approximately two-thirds of the cumulative pretax costs relate to cash outlays, primarily related to employee separation expense. approximately one-third of the cumulative pretax costs are non-cash, relating primarily to the accelerated depreciation of facilities to be closed or divested.
in november 2014, merck's board of directors raised the company's quarterly dividend to $0.45 per share from $0.44 per share. during 2014, the company returned nearly $13 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
earnings per common share assuming dilution attributable to common shareholders ("eps") for 2014 were $4.07 compared with $1.47 in 2013. eps in both years reflect the impact of acquisition and divestiture-related costs and restructuring costs, as well as certain other items, which in 2014 includes an $11.2 billion gain recognized in connection with the divestiture of mcc. non-gaap eps, which excludes these items, were $3.49 in both 2014 and 2013 (see "non-gaap income and non-gaap eps" below).
competition and the health care environment competition the markets in which the company conducts its business and the pharmaceutical industry are highly competitive and highly regulated. the company's competitors include other worldwide research-based pharmaceutical companies, smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus, and generic drug and animal health care manufacturers. the company's operations may be adversely affected by generic and biosimilar competition as the company's products mature, as well as technological advances of competitors, industry consolidation, patents granted to competitors, competitive combination products, new products of competitors, the generic availability of competitors' branded products, and new information from clinical trials of marketed products or post-marketing surveillance. in addition, patent positions are increasingly being challenged by competitors, and the outcome can be highly uncertain. an adverse result in a patent dispute can preclude commercialization of products or negatively affect sales of existing products and could result in the recognition of an impairment charge with respect to intangible assets associated with certain products. competitive pressures have intensified as pressures in the industry have grown. the effect on operations of competitive factors and patent disputes cannot be predicted.
pharmaceutical competition involves a rigorous search for technological innovations and the ability to market these innovations effectively. with its long-standing emphasis on research and development, the company is well positioned to compete in the search for technological innovations. additional resources required to meet market challenges include quality control, flexibility to meet customer specifications, an efficient distribution system and a strong technical information service. the company is active in acquiring and marketing products through external alliances, such as joint ventures and licenses, and has been refining its sales and marketing efforts to further address changing industry conditions. however, the introduction of new products and processes by competitors may result in price reductions and product displacements, even for products protected by patents. for example, the number of compounds available to treat a particular disease typically increases over time and can result in slowed sales growth or reduced sales for the company's products in that therapeutic category.
the highly competitive animal health business is affected by several factors including regulatory and legislative issues, scientific and technological advances, product innovation, the quality and price of the company's products, effective promotional efforts and the frequent introduction of generic products by competitors.
38
health care environment and government regulation global efforts toward health care cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing and market access. in the united states, federal and state governments for many years also have pursued methods to reduce the cost of drugs and vaccines for which they pay. for example, federal laws require the company to pay specified rebates for medicines reimbursed by medicaid and to provide discounts for outpatient medicines purchased by certain public health service entities and hospitals serving a disproportionate share of low income or uninsured patients.
against this backdrop, the united states enacted major health care reform legislation in 2010 (the "patient protection and affordable care act"), which began to be implemented in 2010. various insurance market reforms have advanced and state and federal insurance exchanges were launched in 2014. by the end of the decade, the law is expected to expand access to health care to about 32 million americans who did not previously have insurance coverage. with respect to the effect of the law on the pharmaceutical industry, the law increased the mandated medicaid rebate from 15.1% to 23.1%, expanded the rebate to medicaid managed care utilization, and increased the types of entities eligible for the federal 340b drug discount program. the law also requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay a 50% point of service discount to medicare part d beneficiaries when they are in the medicare part d coverage gap (i.e., the so-called "donut hole"). approximately $430 million, $280 million and $210 million was recorded by merck as a reduction to revenue in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, related to the donut hole provision. also, pharmaceutical manufacturers are now required to pay an annual non-tax deductible health care reform fee. the total annual industry fee was $3.0 billion in 2014 and will remain $3.0 billion in 2015. the fee is assessed on each company in proportion to its share of prior year branded pharmaceutical sales to certain government programs, such as medicare and medicaid. the company recorded $390 million, $151 million and $190 million of costs within marketing and administrative expenses in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, for the annual health care reform fee. the increase in expenses in 2014 reflects final regulations on the annual health care reform fee issued by the internal revenue service (the "irs") on july 28, 2014. the final irs regulations accelerated the recognition criteria for the fee obligation by one year to the year in which the underlying sales used to allocate the fee occurred rather than the year in which the fee was paid. as a result of this change, merck recorded an additional year of expense of $193 million in 2014. the full impact of u.s. health care reform cannot be predicted at this time.
the company also faces increasing pricing pressure globally from managed care organizations, government agencies and programs that could negatively affect the company's sales and profit margins. in the united states, these include (i) practices of managed care groups, federal and state exchanges, and institutional and governmental purchasers, and (ii) u.s. federal laws and regulations related to medicare and medicaid, including the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 and the patient protection and affordable care act. changes to the health care system enacted as part of health care reform in the united states, as well as increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of medicare, medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, could result in further pricing pressures. as an example, health care reform is contributing to an increase in the number of patients in the medicaid program under which sales of pharmaceutical products are subject to substantial rebates.
in addition, in the effort to contain the u.s. federal deficit, the pharmaceutical industry could be considered a potential source of savings via legislative proposals that have been debated but not enacted. these types of revenue generating or cost saving proposals include additional direct price controls in the medicare prescription drug program (part d). in addition, congress may again consider proposals to allow, under certain conditions, the importation of medicines from other countries. it remains very uncertain as to what proposals, if any, may be included as part of future federal budget deficit reduction proposals that would directly or indirectly affect the company.
efforts toward health care cost containment remain intense in several european countries. many countries have continued to announce and execute austerity measures, which include the implementation of pricing actions to reduce prices of generic and patented drugs and mandatory switches to generic drugs. while the company is taking steps to mitigate the impact in these countries, the austerity measures continued to negatively affect the company's revenue performance in 2014 and the company anticipates the austerity measures will continue to negatively affect revenue performance in 2015. in addition, a majority of countries attempt to contain drug costs by engaging in reference pricing in which authorities examine pre-determined markets for published prices of drugs by brand. the authorities then use price data from those markets to set new local prices for brand-name drugs, including the company's. guidelines for examining reference pricing are usually set in local markets and can be changed pursuant to local regulations.
39
in addition, in japan, the pharmaceutical industry is subject to government-mandated biennial price reductions of pharmaceutical products and certain vaccines. furthermore, the government can order repricings for classes of drugs if it determines that it is appropriate under applicable rules.
certain markets outside of the united states have also implemented other cost management strategies, such as health technology assessments, which require additional data, reviews and administrative processes, all of which increase the complexity, timing and costs of obtaining product reimbursement and exert downward pressure on available reimbursement.
the company's focus on emerging markets has increased. governments in many emerging markets are also focused on constraining health care costs and have enacted price controls and related measures, such as compulsory licenses, that aim to put pressure on the price of pharmaceuticals and constrain market access. the company anticipates that pricing pressures and market access challenges will continue in 2015 to varying degrees in the emerging markets.
beyond pricing and market access challenges, other conditions in emerging market countries can affect the company's efforts to continue to grow in these markets, including potential political instability, significant currency fluctuation and controls, financial crises, limited or changing availability of funding for health care, and other developments that may adversely impact the business environment for the company. further, the company may engage third-party agents to assist in operating in emerging market countries, which may affect its ability to realize continued growth and may also increase the company's risk exposure.
in addressing cost containment pressures, the company engages in public policy advocacy with policymakers and continues to work to demonstrate that its medicines provide value to patients and to those who pay for health care. the company advocates with government policymakers to encourage a long-term approach to sustainable health care financing that ensures access to innovative medicines and does not disproportionately target pharmaceuticals as a source of budget savings. in markets with historically low rates of health care spending, the company encourages those governments to increase their investments and adopt market reforms in order to improve their citizens' access to appropriate health care, including medicines.
operating conditions have become more challenging under the global pressures of competition, industry regulation and cost containment efforts. although no one can predict the effect of these and other factors on the company's business, the company continually takes measures to evaluate, adapt and improve the organization and its business practices to better meet customer needs and believes that it is well positioned to respond to the evolving health care environment and market forces.
the pharmaceutical industry is also subject to regulation by regional, country, state and local agencies around the world focused on standards and processes for determining drug safety and effectiveness, as well as conditions for sale or reimbursement.
of particular importance is the fda in the united states, which administers requirements covering the testing, approval, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling, and marketing of prescription pharmaceuticals. in some cases, the fda requirements and practices have increased the amount of time and resources necessary to develop new products and bring them to market in the united states. at the same time, the fda has committed to expediting the development and review of products bearing the "breakthrough therapy" designation, which appears to have accelerated the regulatory review process for medicines with this designation.
the eu has adopted directives and other legislation concerning the classification, labeling, advertising, wholesale distribution, integrity of the supply chain, enhanced pharmacovigilance monitoring and approval for marketing of medicinal products for human use. these provide mandatory standards throughout the eu, which may be supplemented or implemented with additional regulations by the eu member states. the company's policies and procedures are already consistent with the substance of these directives; consequently, it is believed that they will not have any material effect on the company's business.
the company believes that it will continue to be able to conduct its operations, including launching new drugs, in this regulatory environment.
40
access to medicines as a global health care company, merck's primary role is to discover and develop innovative medicines and vaccines. the company also recognizes that it has an important role to play in helping to improve access to its products around the world. the company's efforts in this regard are wide-ranging and include a set of principles that the company strives to embed into its operations and business strategies to guide the company's worldwide approach to expanding access to health care. in addition, the company has many far-reaching philanthropic programs. the merck patient assistance program provides medicines and adult vaccines for free to people in the united states who do not have prescription drug or health insurance coverage and who, without the company's assistance, cannot afford their merck medicine and vaccines. in 2011, merck launched "merck for mothers," a long-term effort with global health partners to end preventable deaths from complications of pregnancy and childbirth. merck has also provided funds to the merck foundation, an independent organization, which has partnered with a variety of organizations dedicated to improving global health.
privacy and data protection the company is subject to a significant number of privacy and data protection laws and regulations globally. the legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve. there has been increased attention to privacy and data protection issues in both developed and emerging markets with the potential to affect directly the company's business, including additional laws and regulations enacted in the united states, europe, asia and latin america, increased enforcement and litigation activity in the united states and other developed markets, and increased regulatory cooperation among privacy authorities globally. the company has adopted a comprehensive global privacy program to manage these evolving risks.
operating results sales worldwide sales totaled $42.2 billion in 2014, a decline of 4% compared with $44.0 billion in 2013. foreign exchange unfavorably affected global sales performance by 1% in 2014. the decline reflects lower revenue resulting from the ongoing impacts of the loss of market exclusivity for several products, including temodar, a treatment for certain types of brain tumors, singulair, a once-a-day oral medicine for the chronic treatment of asthma and for the relief of symptoms of allergic rhinitis, and cozaar and hyzaar, treatments for hypertension. in addition, the sales decline was attributable to product divestitures that occurred in 2014 and 2013 as discussed below, the termination of the company's relationship with azlp, as well as the divestiture of mcc on october 1, 2014. the revenue decline was also driven by lower sales of victrelis and pegintron, medicines for the treatment of chronic hcv, nasonex, an inhaled nasal corticosteroid for the treatment of nasal allergy symptoms, and vytorin, a cholesterol modifying product. these declines were partially offset by growth in remicade and simponi, treatments for inflammatory diseases, the diabetes franchise of januvia/janumet, dulera inhalation aerosol, a combination medicine for the treatment of asthma, implanon/nexplanon, a single-rod subdermal contraceptive implant, as well as higher sales from acute care and animal health products. in addition, the company recognized revenue of $232 million in 2014 in connection with the sale of the u.s. marketing rights to saphris.
sales in the united states were $17.1 billion in 2014, a decline of 6% compared with $18.2 billion in 2013. the sales decrease was driven primarily by the termination of the company's relationship with azlp, the divestiture of mcc and the ongoing impact of product divestitures. in addition, the decline reflects lower sales of temodar, victrelis, vytorin and nasonex, partially offset by higher sales of dulera inhalation aerosol, the januvia/janumet franchise and implanon/nexplanon, as well as by the revenue recognized in connection with the sale of the u.s. marketing rights to saphris.
international sales were $25.2 billion in 2014, a decline of 2% compared with $25.8 billion in 2013. foreign exchange unfavorably affected international sales performance by 2% in 2014. the sales decrease reflects the divestiture of mcc. the decline was also driven by lower sales in the pharmaceutical segment, reflecting declines in japan, europe and canada. sales in japan declined 14% in 2014, to $3.4 billion, of which 8% was due to the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange. the sales decline was largely driven by the biennial price reductions and repricings that occurred in 2014, product divestitures and the ongoing impacts of the loss of the market exclusivity for several products, including cozaar and hyzaar, as well as lower sales of gardasil, a vaccine to help prevent certain diseases caused by four types of hpv, reflecting the japanese government's decision in 2013 to suspend proactive recommendation of hpv vaccines, partially offset by higher sales of pneumovax 23, a vaccine to help prevent pneumococcal disease. sales in europe and
41
canada declined 2% in 2014, to $10.4 billion, including a 1% favorable effect from foreign exchange reflecting lower sales of singulair, nasonex and victrelis, as well as from product divestitures and ongoing generic erosion and fiscal austerity measures in this region, partially offset by growth in simponi, remicade, janumet and januvia. sales in the emerging markets were $7.8 billion in 2014, essentially flat compared with 2013, including a 5% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange, reflecting higher sales of vaccine, acute care, and diabetes products, offset by lower sales of hcv products, as well from product divestitures. total international sales represented 60% and 59% of total sales in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
global efforts toward health care cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing and market access worldwide. in the united states, health care reform is contributing to an increase in the number of patients in the medicaid program under which sales of pharmaceutical products are subject to substantial rebates. in many international markets, government-mandated pricing actions have reduced prices of generic and patented drugs. in addition, other austerity measures negatively affected the company's revenue performance in 2014. the company anticipates these pricing actions and other austerity measures will continue to negatively affect revenue performance in 2015.
in october 2013, the company sold its active pharmaceutical ingredient ("api") manufacturing business in the netherlands and, effective december 31, 2013, certain related products within diversified brands. in november 2013, merck sold the u.s. rights to certain ophthalmic products and in january 2014 sold the u.s. marketing rights to saphris. in addition, the company sold the u.s. rights to zioptan in april 2014 and divested certain ophthalmic products in several international markets (most of which closed on july 1, 2014). on october 1, 2014, the company sold its mcc business to bayer including the prescription rights to claritin and afrin. the sales decline in 2014 attributable to these divestitures was approximately $1.1 billion, of which approximately $575 million related to the pharmaceutical segment, $345 million related to the consumer care segment and $150 million related to the divested api manufacturing business (non-segment revenues). also, as discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the company's relationship with azlp terminated on june 30, 2014; therefore, effective july 1, 2014, the company no longer records supply sales to azlp which resulted in a sales decline of approximately $450 million in the alliances segment.
worldwide sales totaled $44.0 billion in 2013, a decline of 7% compared with $47.3 billion in 2012. the sales decline was driven primarily by lower sales of singulair. the patents that provided u.s. market exclusivity and market exclusivity in a number of major european markets for singulair expired in august 2012 and february 2013, respectively, and the company experienced a significant and rapid decline in singulair sales in those markets thereafter. foreign exchange unfavorably affected global sales performance by 2% in 2013. the revenue decline in 2013 was also driven by lower sales of maxalt, a product for the acute treatment of migraine, cozaar and hyzaar, temodar, clarinex, a non-sedating antihistamine, pegintron, propecia, a product for male pattern hair loss, fosamax, for the treatment osteoporosis, and vytorin. these declines were partially offset by growth in gardasil, remicade, simponi, janumet, isentress, a treatment for hiv-1 infection, dulera inhalation aerosol, and zostavax, a vaccine to help prevent shingles (herpes zoster).

pharmaceutical segment primary care and women's health cardiovascular combined global sales of zetia (marketed in most countries outside the united states as ezetrol ) and vytorin (marketed outside the united states as inegy), medicines for lowering ldl cholesterol, were $4.2 billion in 2014, a decline of 3% compared with 2013. foreign exchange unfavorably affected global sales performance by 1% in 2014. the sales decline was driven primarily by lower volumes of vytorin in the united states and zetia in canada where it lost market exclusivity. combined worldwide sales of zetia and vytorin were $4.3 billion in 2013, essentially flat as compared with 2012 including a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, reflecting higher sales of zetia in the united states due to pricing, partially offset by lower volumes of vytorin in the united states.
in november 2014, merck announced that the investigational improve-it study met its primary and all secondary composite efficacy endpoints. in improve-it, patients taking vytorin - which combines simvastatin with zetia (ezetimibe) - experienced significantly fewer major cardiovascular events (as measured by a composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, re-hospitalization for unstable angina or coronary revascularization occurring at least 30 days after randomization) than patients treated with simvastatin alone. the results from this 18,144 patient study of high-risk patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes were presented at the american heart association 2014 scientific sessions. merck plans to submit the data from improve-it to the fda in mid-2015 to support a new indication for reduction of major cardiovascular events for vytorin and zetia. vytorin and zetia are currently indicated for use along with a healthy diet to reduce elevated ldl cholesterol in patients with hyperlipidemia. the current u.s. prescribing information for both products states that the effect of ezetimibe on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, alone or incremental to statin therapy, has not been determined.
by agreement, a generic manufacturer may launch a generic version of zetia in the united states in december 2016. the u.s. patent and exclusivity periods for zetia and vytorin otherwise expire in april 2017. the company has market exclusivity for zetia in major european markets until october 2017; however, the company expects to apply for pediatric extensions to the term which would extend the date to april 2018. the company has market exclusivity for vytorin in those markets until april 2019.
for business reasons, the company has no plans at this time to reintroduce liptruzet to the u.s. market. the company has not supplied liptruzet in the united states since its january 2014 voluntary recall of that product due to packaging defects. the two active ingredients in liptruzet remain available: zetia from merck, and atorvastatin as a generic from multiple manufacturers.
in may 2014, merck announced that the fda approved zontivity for the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with a history of myocardial infarction or with peripheral arterial disease. the u.s. prescribing information for zontivity includes a boxed warning regarding bleeding risk. in january 2015, zontivity was approved by the european commission (the "ec") for coadministration with acetylsalicylic acid and, where appropriate, clopidogrel, to reduce atherothrombotic events in adult patients with a history of myocardial infarction. merck currently plans to launch zontivity in the eu in late 2015 or early 2016.
diabetes worldwide combined sales of januvia and janumet, medicines that help lower blood sugar levels in adults with type 2 diabetes, were $6.0 billion in 2014, an increase of 3% compared with 2013 including a 1% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. the growth was driven primarily by higher sales of both januvia and janumet in the united states and by volume growth in europe, partially offset by lower sales of januvia in japan due to lower pricing. in april 2014, all dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ("dpp-4") inhibitors, including januvia, were subject to repricing in japan. combined global sales of januvia and janumet were $5.8 billion in 2013, an increase of 2% compared with 2012 including a 3% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. the sales growth reflects higher volumes outside of the united states.
the trial evaluating cardiovascular outcomes with sitagliptin ("tecos"), an event-driven, cardiovascular outcomes study with sitagliptin, began in 2008 and enrolled over 14,000 patients. tecos will evaluate the impact of sitagliptin on cardiovascular outcomes when added to usual care compared to usual care without sitagliptin in a large, high-risk type 2 diabetes population across multiple countries. tecos is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2015 and the company expects that the results of tecos will be presented at the annual scientific meeting of the
44
american diabetes association in june 2015. if the results of the tecos trial show a negative effect on cardiovascular outcomes or reveal another safety issue related to the use of sitagliptin, that could have a material adverse effect on the sales of januvia and janumet/janumet xr.
general medicine and women's health worldwide sales of nuvaring, a vaginal contraceptive product, were $723 million in 2014, an increase of 5% compared with 2013 including a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, largely reflecting higher pricing in the united states. global sales of nuvaring were $686 million in 2013, an increase of 10% compared with 2012, primarily reflecting volume growth and favorable pricing in the united states.
worldwide sales of implanon/nexplanon, a single-rod subdermal contraceptive implant, grew 25% to $502 million in 2014 compared with 2013 driven primarily by higher demand in the united states. implanon/nexplanon sales increased 16% to $403 million in 2013 compared with 2012 driven primarily by volume growth in the united states that was partially offset by declines in the emerging markets from pricing pressures.
global sales of dulera inhalation aerosol, a combination medicine for the treatment of asthma, were $460 million in 2014, $324 million in 2013 and $207 million in 2012 reflecting higher demand in the united states. dulera inhalation aerosol was approved by the fda in june 2010.
global sales of follistim aq (marketed in most countries outside the united states as puregon), a fertility treatment, declined 14% to $412 million in 2014 compared with 2013 driven largely by lower pricing in the united states, as well as by lower sales in europe driven primarily by volume declines. sales of follistim aq grew 3% to $481 million in 2013 compared with 2012 driven largely by positive performance in the united states. the patent that provides market exclusivity for follistim aq in the united states expires in june 2015.
in august 2014, merck announced that the fda approved belsomra (suvorexant) for the treatment of adults with insomnia who have difficulty falling asleep and/or staying asleep. belsomra became available in the united states in early 2015. following receipt of marketing approval, belsomra was launched in japan in november 2014. the company is continuing with plans to seek approval for suvorexant in other countries around the world.
in april 2014, merck announced that the fda approved grastek and ragwitek tablets for sublingual use. grastek is an allergen extract indicated as immunotherapy for the treatment of grass pollen-induced allergic rhinitis with or without conjunctivitis confirmed by positive skin test or in vitro testing for pollen-specific ige antibodies for timothy grass or cross-reactive grass pollens. grastek is approved for use in persons 5 through 65 years of age. ragwitek is an allergen extract indicated as immunotherapy for the treatment of short ragweed pollen-induced allergic rhinitis with or without conjunctivitis confirmed by positive skin test or in vitro testing for pollen-specific ige antibodies for short ragweed pollen. ragwitek is approved for use in adults 18 through 65 years of age. neither grastek nor ragwitek is indicated for the immediate relief of allergic symptoms. the prescribing information for grastek and ragwitek includes a boxed warning regarding severe allergic reactions. both grastek and ragwitek, as well as an ongoing phase 3 program for sublingual immunotherapy tablets for allergic rhinitis associated with house dust mites, are part of a north america partnership between merck and alk-abello.
hospital and specialty hepatitis worldwide sales of pegintron, a treatment for chronic hcv, were $381 million in 2014, a decline of 23% compared with 2013, driven by lower volumes in most regions as the availability of new therapeutic options has resulted in loss of market share or led to patient treatment delays in markets anticipating the availability of new therapeutic options. foreign exchange unfavorably affected global sales performance by 3% in 2014. global sales of pegintron declined 24% to $496 million in 2013 compared with 2012 reflecting declines in all regions that were attributable in part to patient treatment being delayed by health care providers in anticipation of new therapeutic options becoming available. foreign exchange unfavorably affected global sales performance by 3% in 2013.
global sales of victrelis, an oral medicine for the treatment of chronic hcv, were $153 million in 2014, a decline of 64% compared with 2013, driven by lower volumes in nearly all regions, particularly within the united states, as the availability of new therapeutic options has resulted in loss of market share or led to patient treatment delays in markets anticipating the availability of new therapeutic options. worldwide sales of victrelis were $428 million in 2013, a decline of 15% compared with 2012 including a 1% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. sales declines
45
in the united states, europe and canada were partially offset by growth across the emerging markets. the sales declines in the united states, europe and canada were attributable in part to patient treatment being delayed by health care providers in anticipation of new therapeutic options becoming available.
sales of the company's products indicated for treatment of chronic hcv including victrelis and pegintron discussed above, as well as rebetol, continue to be adversely affected by new therapeutic options becoming available. during 2014, these trends accelerated more rapidly than previously anticipated by the company. in addition, developments in the competitive hcv treatment market led to market share losses that were greater than the company had predicted. these factors caused changes in cash flow projections for pegintron, victrelis and rebetol that indicated the intangible asset values were not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flows basis. the company utilized market participant assumptions to determine its best estimate of the fair values of the intangible assets related to pegintron, victrelis and rebetol that, when compared with their related carrying values, resulted in impairment charges of $793 million related to pegintron, $244 million related to victrelis and $35 million related to rebetol recorded within materials and production costs in 2014. sales of these products were adversely affected in 2013 by patient treatment being delayed by health care providers in anticipation of new therapeutic options becoming available. sales of rebetol, a product sold almost entirely in international markets, were particularly adversely affected by this trend given the markets where rebetol is sold, as well as from generic competition. during 2013, the company recorded an impairment charge of $156 million on the rebetol intangible asset. in the event future circumstances arise that significantly reduce current cash flow projections for these products, the company may record additional intangible asset impairment charges in the future. the carrying value of the intangible assets related to these products was $96 million in the aggregate at december 31, 2014.
following receipt of market approval, vanihep, an oral twice-daily protease inhibitor for the treatment of chronic hcv was launched in japan in november 2014. vanihep will be available only in japan.
hiv worldwide sales of isentress, an hiv integrase inhibitor for use in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of hiv-1 infection, increased 2% in 2014 to $1.7 billion compared with 2013 primarily reflecting volume growth in europe and the emerging markets, particularly in latin america resulting from government tenders, partially offset by volume declines in the united states reflecting competitive pressures. global sales of isentress grew 8% to $1.6 billion in 2013 compared with 2012 driven primarily by volume growth in the united states and europe. foreign exchange unfavorably affected global sales performance by 1% in both 2014 and 2013.
acute care global sales of cancidas, an anti-fungal product, increased 3% in 2014 to $681 million compared with 2013 largely reflecting volume growth in the asia pacific region, particularly in china. sales of cancidas increased 7% to $660 million in 2013 compared with 2012 reflecting growth in most emerging markets, as well as in europe and japan.
worldwide sales of noxafil, for the prevention of invasive fungal infections, grew 30% in 2014 to $402 million and increased 20% in 2013 to $309 million driven by volume growth in the united states and europe reflecting a positive impact from the approval of new formulations.
bridion, for the reversal of two types of neuromuscular blocking agents used during surgery, is approved and has been launched in many countries outside of the united states. sales of bridion rose 18% in 2014 to $340 million compared with 2013 driven by volume growth in all markets. foreign exchange unfavorably affected global sales performance by 6% in 2014. sales of bridion were $288 million in 2013, an increase of 10% compared with 2012. the sales growth was driven by volume growth in europe, the emerging markets and japan, partially offset by a 13% unfavorable effect of foreign exchange primarily on sales in japan. in september 2013, the company received a crl from the fda for the resubmission of the nda for bridion. to address the crl, the company conducted a new hypersensitivity study and, in october 2014, resubmitted the nda to the fda. the company anticipates an fda advisory committee meeting will be held on march 18, 2015 to review bridion. if approved, the company expects to launch bridion in the united states later in 2015.
in january 2015, merck acquired cubist, a leader in the development of new therapies to treat serious and potentially life-threatening infections caused by a broad range of increasingly drug-resistant bacteria. cubist's products include cubicin, an i.v. antibiotic for complicated skin and skin structure infections or bacteremia, when caused by
46
designated susceptible organisms, zerbaxa, a combination product recently approved by the fda for the treatment of adults with complicated urinary tract infections caused by designated susceptible gram-negative organisms or with complicated intra-abdominal infections caused by designated susceptible gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, and sivextro for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections ("absssi") in adults caused by designated susceptible gram-positive organisms. both zerbaxa and sivextro are under review in the eu.
immunology sales of remicade, a treatment for inflammatory diseases (marketed by the company in europe, russia and turkey), were $2.4 billion in 2014, an increase of 4% compared with 2013 reflecting sales growth in europe, partially offset by a decline in russia. sales of remicade were $2.3 billion in 2013, an increase of 9% compared with 2012 including a 2% favorable effect from foreign exchange. sales growth reflects volume growth in europe, as well as russia. in september 2013, the ec approved an infliximab biosimilar. while the company is experiencing biosimilar competition in certain smaller european markets, the company anticipates a more substantial decline in remicade sales following loss of market exclusivity in major european markets in february 2015. additionally, the company anticipates mandatory price reductions in certain european markets.
sales of simponi, a once-monthly subcutaneous treatment for certain inflammatory diseases (marketed by the company in europe, russia and turkey), grew 38% in 2014 to $689 million compared with 2013 driven by demand in europe reflecting in part a positive impact from the ulcerative colitis indication. in september 2013, the ec approved simponi for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies. sales of simponi were $500 million in 2013 compared with $331 million in 2012 driven by continued launch activities.
other worldwide sales of ophthalmic products cosopt and trusopt declined 38% in 2014 to $257 million compared with 2013 driven largely by the divestiture of cosopt and trusopt in many international markets in 2014 and the sale of the u.s. rights to cosopt and cosopt pf in 2013 as discussed below. sales of cosopt and trusopt were $416 million in 2013, a decline of 6% compared with 2012, reflecting a 7% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange and lower sales in europe and canada due to generic competition, partially offset by volume growth in japan.
in november 2013, merck sold the u.s. rights to ophthalmic products cosopt and cosopt pf (as well as azasite through the sale of its inspire pharmaceuticals, inc. subsidiary) to akorn, inc ("akorn"). also, as noted above, in may 2014, merck entered into an agreement to sell certain ophthalmic products, including cosopt and trusopt, to santen in japan and markets in europe and asia pacific. the transaction closed in most markets on july 1, 2014. the remaining markets closed on october 1, 2014. merck continues to sell its ophthalmic products in markets not included in the transactions with santen and akorn.
merck's sales of saphris (asenapine), an antipsychotic indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar i disorder in adults, were $84 million in 2014, $158 million in 2013 and $166 million in 2012. in january 2014, merck sold the u.s. marketing rights to saphris to forest laboratories, inc. ("forest"). under the terms of the agreement, forest made upfront payments of $232 million, which are reflected in sales in 2014, and will make additional payments to merck based on defined sales milestones. in addition, as part of this transaction, merck has agreed to supply product to forest (subsequently acquired by actavis plc) until patent expiry. asenapine, sold under the brand name sycrest, is also approved in the eu for the treatment of bipolar i disorder in adults. under a commercialization agreement for sycrest sublingual tablets (5 mg, 10 mg), h. lundbeck a/s makes product supply payments in exchange for exclusive commercial rights to sycrest in all markets outside the united states, china and japan. during 2013, the company recorded an impairment charge on the saphris/sycrest intangible asset (see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements).
other products contained in hospital and specialty include among others, invanz, for the treatment of certain infections; and primaxin, an anti-bacterial product.
oncology global sales of emend, for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced and post-operative nausea and vomiting, were $553 million in 2014, an increase of 9% compared with 2013 including a 1% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange, largely reflecting volume growth in most regions. sales of emend were $507 million in 2013, an increase
47
of 4% compared with 2012 including a 1% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange, largely reflecting volume growth in the united states and the emerging markets, partially offset by a decline in japan.
sales of temodar (marketed as temodal outside the united states), a treatment for certain types of brain tumors, declined 51% to $350 million in 2014 and decreased 23% to $708 million in 2013. foreign exchange unfavorably affected global sales performance by 3% in both 2014 and 2013. the sales declines were driven primarily by generic competition in the united states, as well as in europe. as previously disclosed, by agreement, a generic manufacturer launched a generic version of temodar in the united states in august 2013. the u.s. patent and exclusivity periods otherwise expired in february 2014. temodar lost patent exclusivity in the eu in 2009. accordingly, the company is experiencing sales declines due to the loss of exclusivity in these markets and the company expects these declines to continue.
in september 2014, merck announced that the fda granted accelerated approval of keytruda at a dose of 2 mg/kg every three weeks for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and disease progression following ipilimumab and, if braf v600 mutation positive, a braf inhibitor. keytruda is the first anti-pd-1 (programmed death receptor-1) therapy approved in the united states. in june 2014, merck announced the european medicines agency (the "ema") accepted for review a marketing authorization application ("maa") for keytruda for the treatment of advanced melanoma. the company has made additional regulatory filings in other countries and further filings are planned. in december 2014, the company estimates 2,000 patients were receiving treatment with keytruda. sales of keytruda were $55 million in 2014.
the keytruda clinical development program also includes studies across a broad range of cancer types (see "research and development" below). in october 2014, keytruda was granted breakthrough therapy designation by the fda for the treatment of patients with epidermal growth factor receptor mutation-negative, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearrangement-negative non-small-cell lung cancer whose disease has progressed on or following platinum-based chemotherapy. the company anticipates submitting an sbla to the fda in mid-2015 for keytruda.
diversified brands merck's diversified brands include human health pharmaceutical products that are approaching the expiration of their marketing exclusivity or are no longer protected by patents in developed markets, but continue to be a core part of the company's offering in other markets around the world.
respiratory global sales of nasonex, an inhaled nasal corticosteroid for the treatment of nasal allergy symptoms, declined 18% to $1.1 billion in 2014 compared with 2013. foreign exchange unfavorably affected global sales performance by 2% in 2014. the sales decline was driven primarily by lower demand in the united states, as well as by lower volumes in europe and canada from generic competition. by agreement, generic manufacturers were able to launch a generic version of nasonex in most european markets on january 1, 2014 and generic versions of nasonex have since launched in several of these markets. accordingly, the company experienced a rapid decline in nasonex sales in europe in 2014 and expects the decline to continue. sales of nasonex increased 5% to $1.3 billion in 2013 compared with 2012 driven primarily by increases in the united states, reflecting net favorable adjustments to indirect customer discounts, as well as by volume growth in japan, partially offset by declines in latin america, canada and europe. foreign exchange unfavorably affected global sales performance by 3% in 2013. in 2009, apotex inc. and apotex corp. (collectively, "apotex") filed an application with the fda seeking approval to sell its generic version of nasonex. in june 2012, the u.s. district court for the district of new jersey ruled against the company in a patent infringement suit against apotex holding that apotex's generic version of nasonex does not infringe on the company's formulation patent. in june 2013, the court of appeals for the federal circuit issued a decision affirming the u.s. district court decision and the company has exhausted all of its appeal options. if apotex's generic version becomes available, significant losses of u.s. nasonex sales could occur and the company may take a non-cash impairment charge with respect to the carrying value of the nasonex intangible asset, which was $719 million at december 31, 2014. if the nasonex intangible asset is determined to be impaired, the impairment charge could be material. u.s. sales of nasonex were $577 million in 2014.
worldwide sales of singulair, a once-a-day oral medicine for the chronic treatment of asthma and for the relief of symptoms of allergic rhinitis, were $1.1 billion in 2014, a decline of 9% compared with 2013 including a 5% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange, primarily reflecting lower sales in europe as a result of generic competition.
48
the patents that provided market exclusivity for singulair expired in a number of major european markets in february 2013 and the company experienced significant and rapid declines in sales of singulair in those markets following the patent expiries and expects the declines to continue. global sales of singulair fell 69% to $1.2 billion in 2013 compared with 2012 driven primarily by lower sales in the united states and europe as a result of generic competition. the patent that provided u.s. market exclusivity for singulair expired in august 2012. the patent that provides market exclusivity for singulair in japan will expire in 2016. singulair sales in japan were $537 million in 2014.
global sales of cozaar and its companion agent hyzaar (a combination of cozaar and hydrochlorothiazide), treatments for hypertension, declined 20% in 2014 to $806 million and decreased 22% in 2013 to $1.0 billion. foreign exchange unfavorably affected global sales performance by 4% and 8% in 2014 and 2013, respectively. the patents that provided market exclusivity for cozaar and hyzaar in the united states and in most major international markets have expired. accordingly, the company is experiencing significant declines in cozaar and hyzaar sales and expects the declines to continue.
worldwide sales of fosamax (marketed as fosamac in japan) and fosamax plus d (marketed as fosavance throughout the eu) for the treatment and, in the case of fosamax, prevention of osteoporosis, decreased 16% in 2014 to $470 million and declined 17% in 2013 to $560 million driven by declines in all regions. these medicines have lost market exclusivity in the united states and in most major international markets. the company expects the sales declines within the fosamax product franchise to continue.
other products contained in diversified brands include among others, clarinex, a non-sedating antihistamine; arcoxia for the treatment of arthritis and pain; propecia, a product for the treatment of male pattern hair loss, zocor, a statin for modifying cholesterol; and remeron, an antidepressant.
vaccines the following discussion of vaccines does not include sales of vaccines sold in most major european markets through sanofi pasteur msd ("spmsd"), the company's joint venture with sanofi pasteur, the results of which are reflected in equity income from affiliates (see "selected joint venture and affiliate information" below). supply sales to spmsd, however, are included.
merck's sales of gardasil, a vaccine to help prevent certain diseases caused by four types of hpv, were $1.7 billion in 2014, a decline of 5% compared with 2013 including a 2% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. the decline reflects lower sales in asia pacific, japan and canada, partially offset by higher government tenders in brazil from the national immunization program, as well as higher public sector purchases in the united states. merck's sales of gardasil grew 12% to $1.8 billion in 2013 compared with 2012 driven primarily by volume growth in the united states, reflecting continued uptake in both males and females, and volume growth in latin america, partially offset by lower volumes in japan. sales in 2014, 2013 and 2012 included $56 million, $37 million and $44 million, respectively, of purchases for the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention ("cdc") pediatric vaccine stockpile. in june 2013, the japanese health ministry issued an advisory to suspend active promotion of hpv vaccines. the company is a party to certain third-party license agreements with respect to gardasil (including a cross-license and settlement agreement with glaxosmithkline). as a result of these agreements, the company pays royalties on worldwide gardasil sales of 19% to 27% which vary by country and are included in materials and production costs.
in december 2014, the company announced that the fda approved gardasil 9, merck's 9-valent hpv vaccine, for use in girls and young women 9 to 26 years of age for the prevention of cervical, vulvar, vaginal, and anal cancers caused by hpv types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58, pre-cancerous or dysplastic lesions caused by hpv types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58, and genital warts caused by hpv types 6 and 11. gardasil 9 is also approved for use in boys 9 to 15 years of age for the prevention of anal cancer caused by hpv types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58, precancerous or dysplastic lesions caused by hpv types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58, and genital warts caused by hpv types 6 and 11. gardasil 9 includes the greatest number of hpv types in any available hpv vaccine.
merck's sales of proquad, a pediatric combination vaccine to help protect against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, were $395 million in 2014, $314 million in 2013 and $61 million in 2012. the increase in 2014 as compared with 2013 was driven primarily by higher sales in the united states reflecting approximately $30 million of government purchases for the cdc pediatric vaccine stockpile. sales of proquad in 2012 were affected by supply constraints. proquad became available again in the united states for ordering in october 2012.
49
merck's sales of varivax, a vaccine to help prevent chickenpox (varicella), were $672 million in 2014, $684 million in 2013 and $846 million in 2012. sales performance in 2014 reflects lower sales in the united states largely offset by growth in the emerging markets. merck's sales of m-m-r ii, a vaccine to help protect against measles, mumps and rubella, were $326 million in 2014, $307 million in 2013 and $365 million in 2012. sales of varivax and m‐m‐r ii declined in 2013 as compared with 2012 due to the availability of proquad discussed above.
merck's sales of zostavax, a vaccine to help prevent shingles (herpes zoster) in adults 50 years of age and older, were $765 million in 2014, an increase of 1% compared with 2013, driven primarily by higher sales in the asia pacific region due to ongoing launches, partially offset by lower demand in the united states, as well as in canada. the company is continuing to educate u.s. customers on the broad managed care coverage for zostavax and the process for obtaining reimbursement. merck's sales of zostavax grew 16% to $758 million in 2013 compared with 2012 driven by higher demand in the united states and canada, as well as by launches within the asia pacific region. merck is continuing to launch zostavax outside of the united states.
merck's sales of pneumovax 23, a vaccine to help prevent pneumococcal disease, grew 14% in 2014 to $746 million compared with 2013 driven primarily by higher sales in japan from the national immunization program, as well as higher sales in the united states attributable to both price and volume. foreign exchange unfavorably affected sales performance by 3% in 2014. merck's sales of pneumovax 23 increased 13% in 2013 to $653 million compared with 2012 driven primarily by volume growth in the emerging markets, as well as volume and price increases in the united states.
merck's sales of rotateq, a vaccine to help protect against rotavirus gastroenteritis in infants and children, increased 4% in 2014 to $659 million compared with 2013 primarily reflecting higher sales in certain emerging markets. merck's sales of rotateq grew 6% in 2013 to $636 million compared with 2012 reflecting higher pricing in the united states and volume growth in japan.
other segments the company's other segments are the animal health and alliances segments, which are not material for separate reporting. prior to its disposition on october 1, 2014, the company also had a consumer care segment.
animal health animal health includes pharmaceutical and vaccine products for the prevention, treatment and control of disease in all major farm and companion animal species. animal health sales are affected by competition and the frequent introduction of generic products. global sales of animal health products totaled $3.5 billion in 2014, growth of 3% compared with 2013 including a 2% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. the sales growth was driven primarily by higher sales of companion animal products, reflecting the launch of bravecto in europe and the united states, as well as higher sales of poultry and aqua products, partially offset by lower sales of zilmax. in august 2013, merck animal health voluntarily suspended sales of zilmax, a feed supplement for beef cattle, in the united states and canada.
in may 2014, merck announced that the fda approved bravecto chewable tablets for dogs to treat fleas and ticks. bravecto is the first and only treatment that has been shown to quickly and effectively kill fleas and multiple tick species for 12 weeks in a single dose. bravecto also is effective for eight weeks against amblyomma americanum ticks. in addition, bravecto has been approved and launched in approximately 30 countries outside of the united states.
global sales of animal health products were $3.4 billion in 2013, a decline of 1% compared with 2012 including a 2% unfavorable effect from foreign exchange. the sales decline reflects lower sales of ruminant products, primarily zilmax, partially offset by growth in companion animal and poultry products. the suspension of zilmax unfavorably affected animal health sales by 4% in 2014 and by 2% in 2013.
alliances the alliances segment includes results from the company's relationship with azlp. on june 30, 2014, astrazeneca exercised its option to buy merck's interest in a subsidiary and, through it, merck's interest in nexium and prilosec. as a result, as of july 1, 2014, the company no longer records equity income from azlp and supply sales to azlp, primarily relating to sales of nexium and prilosec, have terminated (see "selected joint venture and
50
affiliate information" below). revenue from azlp, primarily relating to sales of nexium and prilosec, was $463 million in 2014 through the termination date on june 30, 2014, $920 million in 2013 and $915 million in 2012.
consumer care as noted above, on october 1, 2014, the company divested its consumer care segment. consumer care products included over-the-counter, foot care and sun care products. global sales of consumer care were $1.5 billion in 2014, $1.9 billion in 2013 and $2.0 billion in 2012.

(1)   includes $49 million, $279 million and $200 million of ipr&amp;d impairment charges in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
materials and production materials and production costs were $16.8 billion in 2014, $17.0 billion in 2013 and $16.4 billion in 2012. costs include expenses for the amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with mergers and acquisitions which totaled $4.2 billion in 2014, $4.7 billion in 2013 and $4.9 billion in 2012. costs in 2014 and 2013 include intangible asset impairment charges of $1.1 billion and $486 million, respectively, related to marketed products (see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements). the company may recognize additional non-cash impairment charges in the future related to product intangibles that were measured at fair value and capitalized in connection with mergers and acquisitions and such charges could be material. additionally, costs in 2013 include a $41 million intangible asset impairment charge related to a licensing agreement. also included in materials and production were costs associated with restructuring activities which amounted to $482 million, $446 million and $188 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, including accelerated depreciation and asset write-offs related to the planned sale or closure of manufacturing facilities. separation costs associated with manufacturing-related headcount reductions have been incurred and are reflected in restructuring costs as discussed below.
gross margin was 60.3% in 2014 compared with 61.5% in 2013 and 65.2% in 2012. the amortization of intangible assets, as well as the restructuring and impairment charges noted above reduced gross margin by 13.6 percentage points in 2014, 12.8 percentage points in 2013 and 10.7 percentage points in 2012. excluding these impacts, the gross margin decline in 2014 as compared with 2013 was driven primarily by the unfavorable effects of inventory write-offs largely related to victrelis, as well as by changes in product mix, partially offset by the sale of the u.s. marketing rights to saphris. the gross margin decline in 2013 as compared with 2012 was driven in part by the loss of singulair sales as result of patent expiries in the united states in august 2012 and in major european markets in february 2013. in addition, generic competition in the united states coupled with changes in product mix and continued pricing pressures in mature markets also negatively affected gross margin in 2013 as compared with 2012.
marketing and administrative marketing and administrative expenses declined 3% in 2014 to $11.6 billion driven primarily by lower selling costs and promotional spending, the divestiture of mcc and the favorable effect of foreign exchange, partially offset by an additional year of expense related to the health care reform fee as discussed below, as well as higher acquisition and divestiture-related costs. marketing and administrative expenses decreased 7% in 2013 to $11.9 billion largely due to lower promotional spending and selling costs resulting from restructuring activities, and also reflecting the favorable effect of foreign exchange. expenses for 2014, 2013 and 2012 include restructuring costs of $200 million, $145 million and $90 million, respectively, related primarily to accelerated depreciation for facilities to be closed or
51
divested. separation costs associated with sales force reductions have been incurred and are reflected in restructuring costs as discussed below. expenses also include $234 million, $94 million and $272 million of acquisition and divestiture-related costs in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, consisting of incremental, third-party integration costs related to the merger, including costs related to legal entity and systems integration, as well as transaction and certain other costs related to business acquisitions and divestitures.
on july 28, 2014, the irs issued final regulations on the annual non-tax deductible health care reform fee imposed by the patient protection and affordable care act that is based on an allocation of a company's market share of prior year branded pharmaceutical sales to certain government programs. the final irs regulations accelerated the recognition criteria for the fee obligation by one year to the year in which the underlying sales used to allocate the fee occurred rather than the year in which the fee was paid. as a result of this change, merck recorded an additional year of expense of $193 million during 2014.
research and development research and development expenses were $7.2 billion in 2014, $7.5 billion in 2013 and $8.2 billion in 2012. research and development expenses are comprised of the costs directly incurred by merck research laboratories ("mrl"), the company's research and development division that focuses on human health-related activities, which were approximately $3.7 billion in 2014, $4.2 billion in 2013 and $4.5 billion in 2012. also included in research and development expenses are costs incurred by other divisions in support of research and development activities, including depreciation, production and general and administrative, as well as licensing activity, certain costs from operating segments, including the pharmaceutical and animal health segments, as well as the consumer care segment until its divestiture on october 1, 2014, which in the aggregate were $2.8 billion, $2.9 billion and $3.4 billion for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. costs for 2014 include an $85 million charge related to a collaboration with bayer (see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). the declines in research and development costs were driven by cost savings resulting from restructuring activities, targeted reductions and lower clinical development spend as a result of portfolio prioritization. the decline in these research and development expenses in 2013 as compared with 2012 also reflects lower payments for licensing activity.
research and development expenses also include acquired in-process research and development ("ipr&d") impairment charges of $49 million, $279 million and $200 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively (see "research and development" below). the company may recognize additional non-cash impairment charges in the future for the cancellation or delay of other pipeline programs that were measured at fair value and capitalized in connection with mergers and acquisitions and such charges could be material. also, during 2014, the company recorded a charge of $316 million to increase the estimated fair value of a liability for contingent consideration related to research projects obtained in connection with the acquisition of a business in a prior year (see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements). research and development expenses in 2014, 2013 and 2012 reflect $283 million, $101 million and $57 million, respectively, of accelerated depreciation and asset abandonment costs associated with restructuring activities.
restructuring costs restructuring costs, primarily representing separation and other related costs associated with restructuring activities, were $1.0 billion, $1.7 billion and $664 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. costs in 2014 and 2013 include $594 million and $898 million, respectively, of costs related to the 2013 restructuring program. the remaining costs in 2014 and nearly all of the remaining costs recorded in 2013 and the costs recorded in 2012 related to the merger restructuring program. in 2014, 2013 and 2012, separation costs of $674 million, $1.4 billion and $489 million, respectively, were incurred associated with actual headcount reductions, as well as estimated expenses under existing severance programs for headcount reductions that were probable and could be reasonably estimated. positions eliminated under the 2013 restructuring program were approximately 4,555 in 2014 and 1,540 in 2013. positions eliminated under the merger restructuring program were approximately 1,530 in 2014, 4,475 in 2013 and 3,975 in 2012. these position eliminations are comprised of actual headcount reductions, and the elimination of contractors and vacant positions. also included in restructuring costs are asset abandonment, shut-down and other related costs, as well as employee-related costs such as curtailment, settlement and termination charges associated with pension and other postretirement benefit plans and share-based compensation plan costs. for segment reporting, restructuring costs are unallocated expenses. additional costs associated with the company's restructuring activities are included in materials and production, marketing and administrative and research and development as discussed above.
52
equity income from affiliates equity income from affiliates, which reflects the performance of the company's joint ventures and other equity method affiliates, declined 36% in 2014 to $257 million compared with 2013. the decline was driven primarily by the termination of the company's relationship with azlp. as discussed below, on june 30, 2014, astrazeneca exercised its option to purchase merck's interest in a subsidiary and, through it, merck's interest in nexium and prilosec. effective july 1, 2014, the company no longer records equity income from azlp. (see "selected joint venture and affiliate information" below.) equity income from affiliates declined 37% in 2013 to $404 million compared with 2012 driven primarily by lower equity income from azlp, partially offset by higher equity income from spmsd.
other (income) expense, net other (income) expense, net was $11.4 billion of income in 2014 compared with $815 million of expense in 2013 driven primarily by gains recognized in 2014 including an $11.2 billion gain related to the divestiture of mcc (see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements), a $741 million gain related to astrazeneca's option exercise (see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements), a $480 million gain on the sale of certain ophthalmic products in several international markets (see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements) and a $204 million gain related to the divestiture of sirna (see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements), as well as by lower exchange losses in 2014 due to a venezuelan currency devaluation in 2013 (see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements). partially offsetting the favorability of these items was a $628 million loss on extinguishment of debt in 2014 (see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements) and a $93 million goodwill impairment charge related to the company's joint venture with supera (see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).
other (income) expense, net was $815 million of expense in 2013 compared with $1.1 billion of expense in 2012 reflecting a $493 million net charge in 2012 relating to the settlement of certain shareholder litigation (the "enhance litigation"), partially offset by higher exchange losses in 2013 driven by $140 million of exchange losses related to a venezuelan currency devaluation, as well as higher interest expense in 2013 resulting in part from issuances of debt in september 2012 and may 2013.

segment profits are comprised of segment sales less standard costs, certain operating expenses directly incurred by the segment, components of equity income or loss from affiliates and depreciation and amortization expenses. for internal management reporting presented to the chief operating decision maker, merck does not allocate materials and production costs, other than standard costs, the majority of research and development expenses or general and administrative expenses, nor the cost of financing these activities. separate divisions maintain responsibility for monitoring and managing these costs, including depreciation related to fixed assets utilized by these divisions and, therefore, they are not included in segment profits. also excluded from the determination of segment profits are acquisition and divestiture-related costs, including the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments and intangible asset impairment charges, restructuring costs, taxes paid at the joint venture level and a portion of equity income. additionally, segment profits do not reflect other expenses from corporate and manufacturing cost centers and other miscellaneous income or expense. these unallocated items, including in 2014 gains on divestitures (including mcc), the gain on astrazeneca's option exercise, the loss on extinguishment of debt and an additional year of expense related to the health care reform fee, as well as the charge recorded in 2012 related to the settlement of the enhance litigation are reflected in "other" in the above table. also included in "other" are miscellaneous corporate profits (losses), as well as operating profits (losses) related to third-party manufacturing sales, divested products or businesses, and other supply sales.
pharmaceutical segment profits declined 4% in 2014 compared with 2013 driven primarily by the unfavorable effects of product divestitures and loss of market exclusivity for certain products, partially offset by cost savings from productivity measures. pharmaceutical segment profits declined 11% in 2013 compared with 2012 driven primarily by the effects of the loss of market exclusivity for certain products, particularly singulair. the decline in other segment

profits in 2014 as compared with 2013 was driven primarily by the termination of the company's relationship with azlp, as well as the divestiture of mcc.
taxes on income the effective income tax rates of 30.9% in 2014, 18.5% in 2013 and 27.9% in 2012 reflect the impacts of acquisition and divestiture-related costs and restructuring costs, partially offset by the beneficial impact of foreign earnings. the effective income tax rate for 2014 reflects the impact of the gain on the divestiture of mcc being taxed at combined u.s. federal and state tax rates. the effective income tax rate for 2014 includes a net tax benefit of $517 million recorded in connection with astrazeneca's option exercise (see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements) and a benefit of approximately $300 million associated with a capital loss generated in connection with the sale of sirna (see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). the effective income tax rate for 2014 also includes the unfavorable impact of an additional year of expense for the non-tax deductible health care reform fee that the company recorded in accordance with final regulations issued in the third quarter by the irs. the effective tax rate in 2013 reflects a net benefit of $165 million from the settlements of certain federal income tax issues, net benefits from reductions in tax reserves upon expiration of applicable statutes of limitations, the favorable impact of tax legislation enacted in the first quarter of 2013 that extended the r&d tax credit for both 2012 and 2013, as well as an out-of-period net tax benefit of approximately $160 million associated with the resolution of a previously disclosed legacy schering-plough federal income tax issue (see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements). the effective tax rate for 2012 also reflects the favorable impacts of a tax settlement with the canada revenue agency (the "cra"), the realization of foreign tax credits and the impact of a favorable ruling on a state tax matter. in addition, the 2012 effective tax rate reflects the unfavorable impact of the net charge recorded in connection with the settlement of the enhance litigation for which no tax benefit was recorded and does not reflect any impacts for the r&d tax credit, which expired on december 31, 2011. as a result of legislation passed in 2013 that extended the r&d tax credit, both the 2012 and 2013 r&d tax credits were recognized in 2013 as noted above.
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $14 million in 2014, $113 million in 2013 and $131 million in 2012. the decline in 2014 reflects the termination of the company's relationship with azlp (see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements). in addition, the amount for 2014 includes the portion of intangible asset and goodwill impairment charges related to the company's joint venture with supera that are attributable to noncontrolling interests.
net income and earnings per common share net income attributable to merck & co., inc. was $11.9 billion in 2014, $4.4 billion in 2013 and $6.2 billion in 2012. eps was $4.07 in 2014, $1.47 in 2013 and $2.00 in 2012. the increases in net income and eps in 2014 as compared with 2013 were due primarily to the gain on the divestiture of mcc, a gain recognized on astrazeneca's option exercise, gains on other divestitures, lower operating expenses, higher favorability from discrete tax items, revenue recognized from the sale of the u.s. marketing rights to saphris, partially offset by lower sales, a loss on extinguishment of debt, higher intangible asset impairment charges, and an additional year of expense for the health care reform fee. the declines in net income and eps in 2013 as compared with 2012 were due primarily to lower sales reflecting the loss of market exclusivity for certain products, particularly singulair, as well as higher restructuring costs, intangible asset impairment charges and exchange losses, partially offset by the favorable impact of certain tax items and lower operating expenses.
non-gaap income and non-gaap eps non-gaap income and non-gaap eps are alternative views of the company's performance used by management that merck is providing because management believes this information enhances investors' understanding of the company's results. non-gaap income and non-gaap eps exclude certain items because of the nature of these items and the impact that they have on the analysis of underlying business performance and trends. the excluded items consist of acquisition and divestiture-related costs, restructuring costs and certain other items. these excluded items are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. therefore, the information on non-gaap income and non-gaap eps should be considered in addition to, but not in lieu of, net income and eps prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states ("gaap"). additionally, since non-gaap income and non-gaap eps are not measures determined in accordance with gaap, they have no standardized
54
meaning prescribed by gaap and, therefore, may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies.
non-gaap income and non-gaap eps are important internal measures for the company. senior management receives a monthly analysis of operating results that includes non-gaap income and non-gaap eps and the performance of the company is measured on this basis along with other performance metrics. senior management's annual compensation is derived in part using non-gaap income and non-gaap eps.
a reconciliation between gaap financial measures and non-gaap financial measures is as follows:

acquisition and divestiture-related costs non-gaap income and non-gaap eps exclude the impact of certain amounts recorded in connection with mergers, acquisitions and divestitures. these amounts include the amortization of intangible assets, intangible asset impairment charges and expense or income related to changes in the fair value measurement of contingent consideration. also excluded are incremental, third-party integration costs associated with the merger, such as costs related to legal entity and systems integration, as well as transaction and certain other costs associated with business acquisitions and divestitures. these costs should not be considered non-recurring; however, management excludes these amounts from
55
non-gaap income and non-gaap eps because it believes it is helpful for understanding the performance of the continuing business.
restructuring costs non-gaap income and non-gaap eps exclude costs related to restructuring actions (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). these amounts include employee separation costs and accelerated depreciation associated with facilities to be closed or divested. accelerated depreciation costs represent the difference between the depreciation expense to be recognized over the revised useful life of the site, based upon the anticipated date the site will be closed or divested, and depreciation expense as determined utilizing the useful life prior to the restructuring actions. restructuring costs also include asset abandonment, shut-down and other related costs, as well as employee-related costs such as curtailment, settlement and termination charges associated with pension and other postretirement benefit plans and share-based compensation costs. the company has undertaken restructurings of different types during the covered periods and, therefore, these charges should not be considered non-recurring; however, management excludes these amounts from non-gaap income and non-gaap eps because it believes it is helpful for understanding the performance of the continuing business.
certain other items non-gaap income and non-gaap eps exclude certain other items. these items represent substantive, unusual items that are evaluated on an individual basis. such evaluation considers both the quantitative and the qualitative aspect of their unusual nature and generally represent items that, either as a result of their nature or magnitude, management would not anticipate that they would occur as part of the company's normal business on a regular basis. certain other items are comprised of a gain on the divestiture of mcc, a gain recognized in conjunction with astrazeneca's option exercise, including a related net tax benefit on the transaction, a gain on the divestiture of certain ophthalmic products in several international markets, a loss on extinguishment of debt, an additional year of expense related to the health care reform fee, a tax benefit from the sale of sirna and tax benefits from the settlements of certain federal income tax issues, as well as the net charge recorded in connection with the settlement of the enhance litigation.

in addition to the candidates under regulatory review, the company has several drug candidates in phase 3 development. the company anticipates filing an nda or a bla, as applicable, with the fda with respect to certain of these candidates in 2015.
mk-5172a, a once daily, fixed-dose, combination, chronic hcv treatment regimen consisting of mk-5172, grazoprevir, an investigational hcv ns3/4a protease inhibitor, and mk-8742, elbasvir, an investigational hcv ns5a replication complex inhibitor, began phase 3 clinical trials in june 2014. mk-5172a is being investigated in a broad clinical program that includes studies in patients with multiple hcv genotypes who are treatment-naïve, treatment failures, or who fit into other important hcv subpopulations such as patients with cirrhosis and those co-infected with hiv. the company expects to file an nda with the fda in the first half of 2015 for mk-5172a. on january 30, 2015,
57
the company received notification from the fda of its intent to rescind breakthrough therapy designation status for this combination treatment regimen, citing the availability of other recently approved treatments for genotype 1 patients. the company is discussing this matter with the fda and does not expect that it will impact its ability to file an nda for this combination regimen or the timing of that filing.
the company has started the phase 2 c-crest studies to study combination regimens of grazoprevir and mk-3682 (formerly idx21437) with either elbasvir or mk-8408 for the treatment of hcv infection. the company expects to begin phase 3 studies in 2015.
mk-0822, odanacatib, is an oral, once-weekly investigational treatment for patients with osteoporosis. osteoporosis is a disease that reduces bone density and strength and results in an increased risk of bone fractures. odanacatib is a cathepsin k inhibitor that selectively inhibits the cathepsin k enzyme. cathepsin k is known to play a central role in the function of osteoclasts, which are cells that break down existing bone tissue, particularly the protein components of bone. inhibition of cathepsin k is a novel approach to the treatment of osteoporosis. in september 2014, merck announced data from the pivotal phase 3 fracture outcomes study for odanacatib in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. in the long-term odanacatib fracture trial (loft), odanacatib met its primary endpoints and significantly reduced the risk of three types of osteoporotic fractures (radiographically-assessed vertebral, clinical hip, and clinical non-vertebral) compared to placebo and also reduced the risk of the secondary endpoint of clinical vertebral fractures. in addition, treatment with odanacatib led to progressive increases over five years in bone mineral density at the lumbar spine and total hip. the rates of adverse events overall in loft were generally balanced between patients taking odanacatib and placebo. adjudicated events of morphea-like skin lesions and atypical femoral fractures occurred more often in the odanacatib group than in the placebo group. adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular events were generally balanced overall between the treatment groups. there were numerically more adjudicated stroke events with odanacatib than with placebo. adjudicated atrial fibrillation was reported more often in the odanacatib group than in the placebo group. a numeric imbalance in mortality was observed; this numeric difference does not appear to be related to a particular reported cause or causes of death. merck continues to collect data from the blinded extension study and is planning additional analyses of data from the trial, including an independent re-adjudication of major adverse cardiovascular events, in support of regulatory submissions. merck plans to submit an nda to the fda for odanacatib in 2015. merck also plans to submit applications to the ema and the ministry of health, labour, and welfare in japan.
mk-8237 is an investigational allergy immunotherapy tablet for house dust mite allergy. in 2014, the fda approved grastek, a timothy grass pollen allergen extract sublingual immunotherapy tablet, and ragwitek, a short ragweed pollen allergen extract sublingual immunotherapy tablet. both grastek and ragwitek, as well as the ongoing program for mk-8237, are part of a north america partnership between merck and alk-abello.
mk-8931 is merck's novel investigational oral ß-amyloid precursor protein site-cleaving enzyme ("bace") inhibitor for the treatment of alzheimer's disease being studied in a phase 3 trial (apecs) designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mk-8931 versus placebo in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment due to alzheimer's disease, also known as prodromal alzheimer's disease. mk-8931 is also being studied in another phase 3 trial versus placebo in patients with mild-to-moderate alzheimer's disease (epoch).
mk-0859, anacetrapib, is an investigational inhibitor of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein ("cetp") in development for raising hdl-c and reducing ldl-c. anacetrapib is being evaluated in a large, event-driven cardiovascular clinical outcomes trial, reveal (randomized evaluation of the effects of anacetrapib through lipid-modification), involving patients with preexisting vascular disease that is predicted to be completed in 2017.

in september 2014, merck and sun pharmaceutical industries ltd. ("sun pharma") entered into an exclusive worldwide licensing agreement for merck's investigational therapeutic antibody candidate, mk-3222, tildrakizumab, for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis, a skin ailment. under terms of the agreement, sun pharma acquired worldwide rights to tildrakizumab for use in all human indications from merck in exchange for an upfront payment of $80 million. merck will continue all clinical development and regulatory activities, which will be funded by sun pharma. upon product approval, sun pharma will be responsible for regulatory activities, including subsequent submissions, pharmacovigilance, post approval studies, manufacturing and commercialization of the approved product. merck is also eligible to receive future payments associated with regulatory (including product approval) and sales milestones, as well as tiered royalties ranging from mid-single digit through teen percentage rates on sales.
in may 2014, merck and endocyte, inc. ("endocyte") (the company's collaboration partner) announced the withdrawal of the conditional maa from the ema for vintafolide for the treatment of adult patients with folate receptor-positive, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin ("pld"). the companies' decision was based on review of interim data from the proceed trial. the proceed trial has been terminated based on the data safety monitoring board's (the "dsmb") recommendation that the study be stopped because vintafolide in combination with pld versus pld alone did not meet the pre-specified criteria for progression-free survival to allow continuation of the study. the dsmb did not identify any safety concerns for the patients enrolled in the proceed trial. in june 2014, merck returned worldwide rights for vintafolide in all indications to endocyte.
the company maintains a number of long-term exploratory and fundamental research programs in biology and chemistry as well as research programs directed toward product development. the company's research and development model is designed to increase productivity and improve the probability of success by prioritizing the company's research and development resources on candidates the company believes are capable of providing unambiguous, promotable advantages to patients and payers and delivering the maximum value of its approved medicines and vaccines through new indications and new formulations. merck is pursuing emerging product opportunities independent of therapeutic area or modality (small molecule, biologics and vaccines) and is building its biologics capabilities. further, merck has moved to diversify its portfolio through a collaboration on the development of biosimilars, which have the potential to harness the market opportunity presented by biological medicine patent expiries by delivering high quality biosimilars to enhance access for patients worldwide. the company is committed to making externally sourced programs a greater component of its pipeline strategy, with a renewed focus on supplementing its internal research with a licensing and external alliance strategy focused on the entire spectrum of collaborations from early research to late-stage compounds, as well as access to new technologies.
the company also reviews its pipeline to examine candidates which may provide more value through out-licensing. the company is evaluating certain late-stage clinical development and platform technology assets to determine their out-licensing or sale potential.

the company's clinical pipeline includes candidates in multiple disease areas, including atherosclerosis, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, infectious diseases, inflammatory/autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, osteoporosis, respiratory diseases and women's health.
acquired in-process research and development in connection with mergers and acquisitions, the company has recorded the fair value of in-process research projects which, at the time of acquisition, had not yet reached technological feasibility. at december 31, 2014, the balance of ipr&d was $4.3 billion. a majority of this amount relates to the clinical development program for mk-3682, which the company acquired in 2014 with the acquisition of idenix as discussed below. some of the other more significant projects in late-stage development include the company's bace inhibitor and bridion discussed above.
during 2014, 2013 and 2012, approximately $654 million, $346 million and $78 million, respectively, of ipr&d projects received marketing approval in a major market and the company began amortizing these assets based on their estimated useful lives.
all of the ipr&d projects that remain in development are subject to the inherent risks and uncertainties in drug development and it is possible that the company will not be able to successfully develop and complete the ipr&d programs and profitably commercialize the underlying product candidates. the time periods to receive approvals from the fda and other regulatory agencies are subject to uncertainty. significant delays in the approval process, or the company's failure to obtain approval at all, would delay or prevent the company from realizing revenues from these products. additionally, if certain of the ipr&d programs fail or are abandoned during development, then the company will not realize the future cash flows it has estimated and recorded as ipr&d as of the acquisition date, and the company may also not recover the research and development expenditures made since the acquisition to further develop such program. if such circumstances were to occur, the company's future operating results could be adversely affected and the company may recognize impairment charges and such charges could be material.
during 2014, the company recorded $49 million of ipr&d impairment charges within research and development expenses primarily as a result of changes in cash flow assumptions for certain compounds obtained in connection with the supera joint venture, as well as for the discontinuation of certain animal health programs. during 2013, the company recorded $279 million of ipr&d impairment charges. of this amount, $181 million related to the write-off of the intangible asset associated with preladenant as a result of the discontinuation of the clinical development program for this compound. in addition, the company recorded impairment charges resulting from changes in cash flow assumptions for certain compounds, as well as for pipeline programs that had previously been deprioritized and were subsequently deemed to have no alternative use in the period. during 2012, the company recorded $200 million of ipr&d impairment charges primarily for pipeline programs that had previously been deprioritized and were subsequently deemed to have no alternative use during the period.
additional research and development will be required before any of the remaining programs reach technological feasibility. the costs to complete the research projects will depend on whether the projects are brought to their final stages of development and are ultimately submitted to the fda or other regulatory agencies for approval. as of december 31, 2014, the estimated costs to complete projects acquired in connection with mergers and acquisitions in phase 3 development for human health and the analogous stage of development for animal health were approximately $1.1 billion.
acquisitions, research collaborations and license agreements merck continues to remain focused on pursuing opportunities that have the potential to drive both near- and long-term growth. certain of the more significant transactions in 2014 are described below. merck is actively monitoring the landscape for growth opportunities that meet the company's strategic criteria.
in august 2014, merck completed the acquisition of idenix for approximately $3.9 billion in cash ($3.7 billion net of cash acquired). idenix is a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of medicines for the treatment of human viral diseases, whose primary focus is on the development of next-generation oral antiviral therapeutics to treat hcv infection. the transaction was accounted for as an acquisition of a business; accordingly, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. the determination of fair value requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. merck recognized an intangible asset for ipr&d of $3.2 billion related to mk-3682 (formerly idx21437), net deferred tax
60
liabilities of $856 million and other net assets and liabilities of approximately $20 million. mk-3682 is a nucleotide prodrug in phase 2 clinical development being evaluated for potential inclusion in the development of all oral, pan-genotypic fixed-dose combination regimens. the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets acquired of $1.4 billion was recorded as goodwill that was allocated to the pharmaceutical segment and is not deductible for tax purposes. the fair value of the identifiable intangible asset related to ipr&d was determined using an income approach, through which fair value is estimated based upon the asset's probability adjusted future net cash flows, which reflects the stage of development of the project and the associated probability of successful completion. the net cash flows were then discounted to present value using a discount rate of 11.5%. this transaction closed on august 5, 2014; accordingly, the results of operations of the acquired business have been included in the company's results of operations beginning after that date. pro forma financial information has not been included because idenix's historical financial results are not significant when compared with the company's financial results.
in october 2014, the company entered into a worldwide clinical development collaboration with bayer to market and develop its portfolio of soluble guanylate cyclase ("sgc") modulators. this includes bayer's adempas (riociguat), the first member of this novel class of compounds. adempas is approved to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension ("pah") and is the first and only drug treatment approved for patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension ("cteph"). adempas is currently marketed in the united states and europe for both pah and cteph and in japan for cteph. the two companies will equally share costs and profits from the collaboration and implement a joint development and commercialization strategy. the collaboration also includes clinical development of bayer's vericiguat, which is currently in phase 2 trials for worsening heart failure, as well as opt-in rights for other early-stage sgc compounds in development at bayer. merck will in turn make available its early-stage sgc compounds under similar terms. in return for these broad collaboration rights, merck made an upfront payment to bayer of $1.0 billion with the potential for additional milestone payments upon the achievement of agreed-upon sales goals. for adempas, bayer will continue to lead commercialization in the americas, while merck will lead commercialization in the rest of the world. for vericiguat and other potential opt-in products, bayer will lead in the rest of world and merck will lead in the americas. for all products and candidates included in the agreement, both companies will share in development costs and profits on sales and will have the right to co-promote in territories where they are not the lead. the company determined that merck's payment to access bayer's compounds constituted an acquisition of an asset. of the $1.0 billion consideration paid by merck, $915 million of fair value related to currently marketed product adempas and was capitalized as an intangible asset subject to amortization over its estimated useful life of 12 years, and the remaining $85 million of fair value related to the vericiguat compound currently in clinical development and expensed within research and development expenses. the fair values of adempas and vericiguat were determined using an income approach, through which fair value is estimated based upon probability adjusted future net cash flows, and for vericiguat also for the stage of development of the project and the associated probability of successful completion. the net cash flows were then discounted to present value using a discount rate of 10.0% for adempas and 10.5% for vericiguat. future sales based milestones will be accrued when probable and reasonably estimable. the company and bayer each have the right to terminate the agreement for cause on a product-by-product basis for all products being developed and commercialized under the agreement (other than adempas for which bayer has no termination rights) in the event of the other party's material, uncured breach related to any such product.
in december 2014, merck acquired oncoethix, a privately held biotechnology company specializing in oncology drug development. total purchase consideration in the transaction of $153 million included an upfront cash payment of $110 million and future additional milestone payments of up to $265 million that are contingent upon certain clinical and regulatory milestones being achieved, which the company determined had a fair value of $43 million at the acquisition date. the transaction was accounted for as an acquisition of a business; accordingly, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. the determination of fair value requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. merck recognized an intangible asset for ipr&d of $143 million related to mk-8628 (formerly otx015), an investigational, novel oral bet (bromodomain) inhibitor currently in phase 2 studies for the treatment of hematological malignancies and advanced solid tumors, as well as a liability for contingent consideration of $43 million and other net assets and liabilities of $10 million. the fair value of the identifiable intangible asset related to ipr&d was determined using an income approach, through which fair value is estimated based upon the asset's probability adjusted future net cash flows, which reflects the stage of development of the project and the associated probability of successful completion. the net cash flows were then discounted to present value using a discount rate of 11.5%. the fair value of the contingent consideration was determined utilizing a probability weighted estimated cash flow stream adjusted for the expected timing of each payment also
61
utilizing a discount rate of 11.5%. this transaction closed on december 18, 2014; accordingly, the results of operations of the acquired business have been included in the company's results of operations beginning after that date. pro forma financial information has not been included because oncoethix's historical financial results are not significant when compared with the company's financial results.
also, in december 2014, merck and cubist announced a definitive agreement under which merck would acquire cubist for a total purchase price of approximately $9.5 billion. cubist is a leader in the development of new therapies to treat serious and potentially life-threatening infections caused by a broad range of increasingly drug-resistant bacteria. this transaction closed on january 21, 2015; accordingly, the results of operations of the acquired business will be included in the company's results of operations beginning after that date.
in addition, in february 2015, merck and ngm biopharmaceuticals, inc. ("ngm"), a privately-held biotechnology company, announced they have entered into a multi-year collaboration to research, discover, develop and commercialize novel biologic therapies across a wide range of therapeutic areas. the collaboration includes multiple drug candidates currently in preclinical development at ngm, including np201, which is being evaluated for the treatment of diabetes, obesity and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. ngm will lead the research and development of the existing preclinical candidates and have the autonomy to identify and pursue other discovery stage programs at its discretion. merck will have the option to license all resulting ngm programs following human proof of concept trials. if merck exercises this option, merck will lead global product development and commercialization for the resulting products, if approved. under the terms of the agreement, merck will make an upfront payment to ngm of $94 million and will purchase a 15% equity stake in ngm for $106 million. merck will commit up to $250 million to fund all of ngm's efforts under the initial five-year term of the collaboration, with the potential for additional funding if certain conditions are met. prior to merck initiating a phase 3 study for a licensed program, ngm may elect to either receive milestone and royalty payments or, in certain cases, to co-fund development and participate in a global cost and revenue share arrangement of up to 50%. the agreement also provides ngm with the option to participate in the co-promotion of any co-funded program in the united states. merck will have the option to extend the research agreement for two additional two-year terms. this agreement will become effective upon the expiration of the waiting period under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act.
selected joint venture and affiliate information astrazeneca lp in 1982, merck entered into an agreement with astra ab ("astra") to develop and market astra products under a royalty-bearing license. in 1993, merck's total sales of astra products reached a level that triggered the first step in the establishment of a joint venture business carried on by astra merck inc. ("ami"), in which merck and astra each owned a 50% share. this joint venture, formed in 1994, developed and marketed most of astra's new prescription medicines in the united states.
in 1998, merck and astra completed the restructuring of the ownership and operations of the joint venture whereby merck acquired astra's interest in ami, renamed kbi inc. ("kbi"), and contributed kbi's operating assets to a new u.s. limited partnership, astra pharmaceuticals l.p. (the "partnership"), in exchange for a 1% limited partner interest. astra contributed the net assets of its wholly owned subsidiary, astra usa, inc., to the partnership in exchange for a 99% general partner interest. the partnership, renamed astrazeneca lp ("azlp") upon astra's 1999 merger with zeneca group plc, became the exclusive distributor of the products for which kbi retained rights.
merck earned revenue based on sales of kbi products and such revenue was $463 million, $920 million and $915 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, primarily relating to sales of nexium, as well as prilosec. in addition, merck earned certain partnership returns which were recorded in equity income from affiliates. such returns included a priority return provided for in the partnership agreement, a preferential return representing merck's share of undistributed azlp gaap earnings, and a variable return related to the company's 1% limited partner interest. these returns aggregated $192 million, $352 million and $621 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
on june 30, 2014, astrazeneca exercised its option to purchase merck's interest in kbi for $419 million in cash. of this amount, $327 million reflects an estimate of the fair value of merck's interest in nexium and prilosec. this portion of the exercise price, which is subject to a true-up in 2018 based on actual sales from closing in 2014 to june 2018, was deferred and is being recognized over time in other (income) expense, net as the contingency is eliminated as sales occur. the remaining exercise price of $91 million primarily represents a multiple of ten times
62
merck's average 1% annual profit allocation in the partnership for the three years prior to exercise. merck recognized the $91 million as a gain in 2014 within other (income) expense, net. as a result of astrazeneca's option exercise, the company's remaining interest in azlp was redeemed. accordingly, the company also recognized a non-cash gain of approximately $650 million in 2014 within other (income) expense, net resulting from the retirement of $2.4 billion of kbi preferred stock (see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements), the elimination of the company's $1.4 billion investment in azlp and a $340 million reduction of goodwill. this transaction resulted in a net tax benefit of $517 million in 2014, primarily reflecting the reversal of deferred taxes on the azlp investment balance.
as a result of astrazeneca exercising its option, as of july 1, 2014, the company no longer records equity income from azlp and supply sales to azlp have terminated.
sanofi pasteur msd in 1994, merck and pasteur mérieux connaught (now sanofi pasteur s.a.) established an equally-owned joint venture to market vaccines in europe and to collaborate in the development of combination vaccines for distribution in europe.
sales of joint venture products were as follows:

cash provided by operating activities was $7.9 billion in 2014, $11.7 billion in 2013 and $10.0 billion in 2012. the decline in cash provided by operating activities in 2014 as compared with 2013 reflects approximately $5.0 billion of taxes paid on the divestiture of mcc. cash provided by operating activities in 2013 includes a payment made by the company of $480 million in connection with the previously disclosed settlement of the enhance litigation. cash provided by operating activities in 2012 reflects higher contributions to its defined benefit plans as compared with 2014 and 2013. cash provided by operating activities in 2012 also includes a payment of $960 million related to the resolution of certain litigation related to vioxx. cash provided by operating activities continues to be the company's primary source of funds to finance operating needs, capital expenditures, a portion of treasury stock purchases and
63
dividends paid to shareholders. global economic conditions and ongoing sovereign debt issues, among other factors, have adversely affected foreign receivables in certain european countries (see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements).
cash used in investing activities was $374 million in 2014 compared with $3.1 billion in 2013 reflecting cash received in 2014 from the divestiture of mcc and from other dispositions of businesses, primarily related to the transactions with aspen and santen (see notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements), as well as cash received in connection with astrazeneca's option exercise (see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements), partially offset by higher purchases of and lower proceeds from the sale of securities and other investments, cash used for the acquisition of idenix (see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements) and a cash payment made upon formation of the collaboration with bayer (see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). cash used in investing activities was $3.1 billion in 2013 compared with $6.8 billion in 2012 primarily reflecting higher proceeds from the sales of securities and other investments and lower capital expenditures, partially offset by higher purchases of securities and other investments.
cash used in financing activities was $15.1 billion in 2014 compared with $6.0 billion in 2013 driven primarily by higher payments on debt, lower proceeds from the issuance of debt, higher purchases of treasury stock and a decrease in short-term borrowings, partially offset by higher proceeds from the exercise of stock options. cash used in financing activities was $6.0 billion in 2013 compared with $3.3 billion in 2012. the higher use of cash in financing activities was driven primarily by higher purchases of treasury stock, as well as higher payments on debt and a decrease in short-term borrowings, partially offset by higher proceeds from the issuance of debt.
at december 31, 2014, the total of worldwide cash and investments was $29.2 billion, including $15.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and $13.5 billion of long-term investments. generally 80%-90% of these cash and investments are held by foreign subsidiaries and would be subject to significant tax payments if such cash and investments were repatriated in the form of dividends. the company records u.s. deferred tax liabilities for certain unremitted earnings, but when amounts earned overseas are expected to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states, no accrual for u.s. taxes is provided. the amount of cash and investments held by u.s. and foreign subsidiaries fluctuates due to a variety of factors including the timing and receipt of payments in the normal course of business. cash provided by operating activities in the united states continues to be the company's primary source of funds to finance domestic operating needs, capital expenditures, a portion of treasury stock purchases and dividends paid to shareholders.

development obligations are potential future funding commitments of up to approximately $70 million for investments in research venture capital funds. loans payable and current portion of long-term debt reflects $143 million of long-dated notes that are subject to repayment at the option of the holders. required funding obligations for 2015 relating to the company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans are not expected to be material. however, the company currently anticipates contributing approximately $40 million to its u.s. pension plans, $150 million to its international pension plans and $65 million to its other postretirement benefit plans during 2015.
in august 2014, the company terminated its existing credit facility and entered into a new $6.0 billion, five-year credit facility that matures in august 2019. the facility provides backup liquidity for the company's commercial paper borrowing facility and is to be used for general corporate purposes. the company has not drawn funding from this facility.
in october 2014, the company issued euro-denominated senior unsecured notes consisting of €1.0 billion principal amount of 1.125% notes due 2021, €1.0 billion principal amount of 1.875% notes due 2026 and €500 million principal amount of 2.5% notes due 2034. interest on the notes is payable annually. the notes of each series are redeemable in whole or in part at any time at the company's option at varying redemption prices. the net proceeds of the offering of $3.1 billion were used in part to repay debt that was validly tendered in connection with tender offers launched by the company for certain outstanding notes and debentures. the company paid $2.5 billion in aggregate consideration (applicable purchase price together with accrued interest) to redeem $1.8 billion principal amount of debt. in addition, in november 2014, merck redeemed its $1.0 billion 4.00% notes due 2015 and its $1.0 billion 6.00% notes due 2017.
in february 2015, merck issued $8.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes consisting of $300 million principal amount of floating rate notes due 2017, $700 million principal amount of floating rate notes due 2020, $1.25 billion principal amount of 1.85% notes due 2020, $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.35% notes due 2022, $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.75% notes due 2025 and $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.70% notes due 2045. the company used a substantial portion of the net proceeds of the offering to repay commercial paper issued to substantially finance the company's acquisition of cubist. any remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including without limitation repurchases of the company's common stock, and the repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings and upcoming debt maturities.
in december 2014, the company entered into a bridge loan agreement with certain banks pursuant to which the company had the ability to borrow up to $8.0 billion for the purpose of obtaining short-term financing for the acquisition of cubist. the company did not borrow any funds under the bridge loan and, after issuing $8.0 billion of senior unsecured notes as discussed above, terminated the bridge loan on february 20, 2015.
in december 2012, the company filed a securities registration statement with the u.s. securities and exchange commission (the "sec") under the automatic shelf registration process available to "well-known seasoned issuers" which is effective for three years.
effective as of november 3, 2009, the company executed a full and unconditional guarantee of the then existing debt of its subsidiary merck sharp & dohme corp. ("msd") and msd executed a full and unconditional guarantee of the then existing debt of the company (excluding commercial paper), including for payments of principal and interest. these guarantees do not extend to debt issued subsequent to that date.
the company's long-term credit ratings assigned by moody's investors service and standard & poor's are a1 with a stable outlook and aa with a stable outlook, respectively. these ratings continue to allow access to the capital markets and flexibility in obtaining funds on competitive terms. the company continues to maintain a conservative financial profile. the company places its cash and investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in its investment policy guidelines. these guidelines also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. despite this strong financial profile, certain contingent events, if realized, which are discussed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, could have a material adverse impact on the company's liquidity and capital resources. the company does not participate in any off-balance sheet arrangements involving unconsolidated subsidiaries that provide financing or potentially expose the company to unrecorded financial obligations.
in november 2014, the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.45 per share on the company's common stock payable in january 2015.
65
on may 1, 2013, the company announced that its board of directors authorized additional purchases of up to $15 billion of merck's common stock for its treasury. purchases may be made in open-market transactions, block transactions, on or off an exchange, or in privately negotiated transactions. the company purchased $7.7 billion of its common stock (134 million shares) for its treasury during 2014. the company has approximately $2.7 billion remaining under the may share repurchase program. the company purchased $6.5 billion and $2.6 billion of its common stock during 2013 and 2012, respectively, under this and previously authorized share repurchase programs.
financial instruments market risk disclosures the company manages the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on its earnings, cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities through operational means and through the use of various financial instruments, including derivative instruments.
a significant portion of the company's revenues and earnings in foreign affiliates is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. the objectives and accounting related to the company's foreign currency risk management program, as well as its interest rate risk management activities are discussed below.
foreign currency risk management the company has established revenue hedging, balance sheet risk management, and net investment hedging programs to protect against volatility of future foreign currency cash flows and changes in fair value caused by volatility in foreign exchange rates.
the objective of the revenue hedging program is to reduce the potential for longer-term unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates to decrease the u.s. dollar value of future cash flows derived from foreign currency denominated sales, primarily the euro and japanese yen. to achieve this objective, the company will hedge a portion of its forecasted foreign currency denominated third-party and intercompany distributor entity sales that are expected to occur over its planning cycle, typically no more than three years into the future. the company will layer in hedges over time, increasing the portion of third-party and intercompany distributor entity sales hedged as it gets closer to the expected date of the forecasted foreign currency denominated sales. the portion of sales hedged is based on assessments of cost-benefit profiles that consider natural offsetting exposures, revenue and exchange rate volatilities and correlations, and the cost of hedging instruments. the hedged anticipated sales are a specified component of a portfolio of similarly denominated foreign currency-based sales transactions, each of which responds to the hedged currency risk in the same manner. the company manages its anticipated transaction exposure principally with purchased local currency put options, which provide the company with a right, but not an obligation, to sell foreign currencies in the future at a predetermined price. if the u.s. dollar strengthens relative to the currency of the hedged anticipated sales, total changes in the options' cash flows offset the decline in the expected future u.s. dollar equivalent cash flows of the hedged foreign currency sales. conversely, if the u.s. dollar weakens, the options' value reduces to zero, but the company benefits from the increase in the u.s. dollar equivalent value of the anticipated foreign currency cash flows.
in connection with the company's revenue hedging program, a purchased collar option strategy may be utilized. with a purchased collar option strategy, the company writes a local currency call option and purchases a local currency put option. as compared to a purchased put option strategy alone, a purchased collar strategy reduces the upfront costs associated with purchasing puts through the collection of premium by writing call options. if the u.s. dollar weakens relative to the currency of the hedged anticipated sales, the purchased put option value of the collar strategy reduces to zero and the company benefits from the increase in the u.s. dollar equivalent value of its anticipated foreign currency cash flows; however, this benefit would be capped at the strike level of the written call. if the u.s. dollar strengthens relative to the currency of the hedged anticipated sales, the written call option value of the collar strategy reduces to zero and the changes in the purchased put cash flows of the collar strategy would offset the decline in the expected future u.s. dollar equivalent cash flows of the hedged foreign currency sales.
the company may also utilize forward contracts in its revenue hedging program. if the u.s. dollar strengthens relative to the currency of the hedged anticipated sales, the increase in the fair value of the forward contracts offsets the decrease in the expected future u.s. dollar cash flows of the hedged foreign currency sales. conversely, if the u.s. dollar weakens, the decrease in the fair value of the forward contracts offsets the increase in the value of the anticipated foreign currency cash flows. while a weaker u.s. dollar would result in a net benefit, the market value of merck's hedges would have declined by an estimated $660 million and $547 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, from a uniform 10% weakening of the u.s. dollar. the market value was determined using a foreign
66
exchange option pricing model and holding all factors except exchange rates constant. because merck principally uses purchased local currency put options, a uniform weakening of the u.s. dollar would yield the largest overall potential loss in the market value of these options. the sensitivity measurement assumes that a change in one foreign currency relative to the u.s. dollar would not affect other foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar. although not predictive in nature, the company believes that a 10% threshold reflects reasonably possible near-term changes in merck's major foreign currency exposures relative to the u.s. dollar. the cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
the primary objective of the balance sheet risk management program is to mitigate the exposure of foreign currency denominated net monetary assets of foreign subsidiaries where the u.s. dollar is the functional currency from the effects of volatility in foreign exchange. in these instances, merck principally utilizes forward exchange contracts, which enable the company to buy and sell foreign currencies in the future at fixed exchange rates and economically offset the consequences of changes in foreign exchange from the monetary assets. merck routinely enters into contracts to offset the effects of exchange on exposures denominated in developed country currencies, primarily the euro and japanese yen. for exposures in developing country currencies, the company will enter into forward contracts to partially offset the effects of exchange on exposures when it is deemed economical to do so based on a cost-benefit analysis that considers the magnitude of the exposure, the volatility of the exchange rate and the cost of the hedging instrument. the company will also minimize the effect of exchange on monetary assets and liabilities by managing operating activities and net asset positions at the local level. the cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
a sensitivity analysis to changes in the value of the u.s. dollar on foreign currency denominated derivatives, investments and monetary assets and liabilities indicated that if the u.s. dollar uniformly strengthened by 10% against all currency exposures of the company at december 31, 2014 and 2013, income before taxes would have declined by approximately $25 million in 2014 and $109 million in 2013. because the company was in a net long position relative to its major foreign currencies after consideration of forward contracts, a uniform strengthening of the u.s. dollar will yield the largest overall potential net loss in earnings due to exchange. this measurement assumes that a change in one foreign currency relative to the u.s. dollar would not affect other foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar. although not predictive in nature, the company believes that a 10% threshold reflects reasonably possible near-term changes in merck's major foreign currency exposures relative to the u.s. dollar. the cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
in february 2013, the venezuelan government devalued its currency (bolívar fuertes) from 4.30 vef per u.s. dollar to 6.30 vef per u.s. dollar. the company recognized losses due to exchange of approximately $140 million in 2013 resulting from the remeasurement of the local monetary assets and liabilities at the new rate. since january 2010, venezuela has been designated hyperinflationary and, as a result, local foreign operations are remeasured in u.s. dollars with the impact recorded in results of operations.
in march 2013, the venezuelan government announced the creation of a new foreign exchange mechanism called the "complimentary system of foreign currency acquirement" (known as sicad1) that operates similar to an auction system and allows entities in specific sectors to bid for u.s. dollars to be used for payments related to international investments and certain intangibles. in march 2014, the venezuelan government launched another foreign exchange mechanism (known as sicad2) and indicated that all industry sectors would be able to access sicad2 and its use would not be restricted as to purpose. both the sicad1 and sicad2 average rates are published by the central bank of venezuela and at december 31, 2014, the average exchange rates inferred were 12.0 vef per u.s. dollar and 49.99 vef per u.s. dollar, respectively. neither sicad1 nor sicad2 eliminated or changed the official rate of 6.30 vef per u.s. dollar. at december 31, 2014, the company had approximately $670 million (u.s. dollar equivalent at the 6.30 official rate) of net monetary assets in its venezuelan entities, of which the large majority was cash. in 2014, the company received approximately $190 million from venezuela for transactions that were settled at the official rate of 6.30 vef per u.s. dollar, and has approximately $600 million pending approval for future settlement at the official rate. in february 2015, the venezuelan government announced that sicad2 has been replaced with the sistema marginal de divisas (known as simadi). the simadi market is intended to operate based on the principles of supply and demand with buyers and sellers exchanging offers to transact. according to the venezuelan central bank the average exchange rate on the first day of trading on february 12, 2015 was 170.0 vef per u.s. dollar. the sicad1 mechanism remains unchanged. recent announcements by the venezuelan government have indicated that essential goods, including food and medicine, will remain at the official rate of 6.30 vef per u.s. dollar. the company has not used
67
either sicad mechanism to settle any transactions and does not anticipate using either the sicad1 or simadi mechanisms to settle any transactions. accordingly, the company concluded it was appropriate to continue to use the official rate of 6.30 vef per u.s. dollar for remeasurement purposes. if circumstances change such that the company concludes it would no longer be appropriate to use the official rate, or if a devaluation of the official rate occurs, it could result in a significant charge to the company's future results of operations.
the company also uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its net investment in foreign operations against movements in exchange rates. the forward contracts are designated as hedges of the net investment in a foreign operation. the company hedges a portion of the net investment in certain of its foreign operations and measures ineffectiveness based upon changes in spot foreign exchange rates. the effective portion of the unrealized gains or losses on these contracts is recorded in foreign currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive income ("oci"), and remains in accumulated other comprehensive income ("aoci") until either the sale or complete or substantially complete liquidation of the subsidiary. the cash flows from these contracts are reported as investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency debt. the company's senior unsecured euro-denominated notes have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of the net investment in a foreign operation. accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments are included in foreign currency translation adjustment within oci.
interest rate risk management the company may use interest rate swap contracts on certain investing and borrowing transactions to manage its net exposure to interest rate changes and to reduce its overall cost of borrowing. the company does not use leveraged swaps and, in general, does not leverage any of its investment activities that would put principal capital at risk.
at december 31, 2014, the company was a party to 17 pay-floating, receive-fixed interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges of fixed-rate notes in which the notional amounts match the amount of the hedged fixed-rate notes as detailed in the table below.

the interest rate swap contracts are designated hedges of the fair value changes in the notes attributable to changes in the benchmark london interbank offered rate ("libor") swap rate. the fair value changes in the notes attributable to changes in the libor are recorded in interest expense and offset by the fair value changes in the swap contracts. during 2014, the company terminated interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted the company's 6.00% fixed-rate notes due in 2017 to floating-rate instruments. the interest rate swap contracts were designated hedges of the fair value changes in the notes attributable to changes in the benchmark libor swap rate. as a result of the swap terminations, the company received $3 million in cash. the cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
in february 2015, in connection with the company's february debt offering (see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements), merck entered into ten additional interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts of $250 million each that effectively convert the company's 1.85% notes due in 2020 and the company's 2.35% notes due in 2022 to floating-rate instruments.
the company's investment portfolio includes cash equivalents and short-term investments, the market values of which are not significantly affected by changes in interest rates. the market value of the company's medium- to long-term fixed-rate investments is modestly affected by changes in u.s. interest rates. changes in medium- to long-term u.s. interest rates have a more significant impact on the market value of the company's fixed-rate borrowings, which generally have longer maturities. a sensitivity analysis to measure potential changes in the market value of
68
merck's investments and debt from a change in interest rates indicated that a one percentage point increase in interest rates at december 31, 2014 and 2013 would have positively affected the net aggregate market value of these instruments by $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. a one percentage point decrease at december 31, 2014 and 2013 would have negatively affected the net aggregate market value by $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. the fair value of merck's debt was determined using pricing models reflecting one percentage point shifts in the appropriate yield curves. the fair values of merck's investments were determined using a combination of pricing and duration models.
critical accounting policies the company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap and, accordingly, include certain amounts that are based on management's best estimates and judgments. estimates are used when accounting for amounts recorded in connection with mergers and acquisitions, including initial fair value determinations of assets and liabilities, primarily ipr&d and other intangible assets, as well as subsequent fair value measurement. additionally, estimates are used in determining such items as provisions for sales discounts and returns, depreciable and amortizable lives, recoverability of inventories, including those produced in preparation for product launches, amounts recorded for contingencies, environmental liabilities and other reserves, pension and other postretirement benefit plan assumptions, share-based compensation assumptions, restructuring costs, impairments of long-lived assets (including intangible assets and goodwill) and investments, and taxes on income. because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. application of the following accounting policies result in accounting estimates having the potential for the most significant impact on the financial statements.
mergers and acquisitions to determine whether acquisitions qualify as business combinations or asset acquisitions, the company makes certain judgments, which include assessment of the inputs, processes, and outputs associated with the acquired set of activities. if the company determines that the acquisition consists of inputs, as well as processes that when applied to those inputs have the ability to create outputs, the acquisition is determined to be a business combination.
in a business combination, the acquisition method of accounting requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded as of the date of the merger or acquisition at their respective fair values with limited exceptions. assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies are recognized at fair value if fair value can reasonably be estimated. if the acquisition date fair value of an asset acquired or liability assumed that arises from a contingency cannot be determined, the asset or liability is recognized if probable and reasonably estimable; if these criteria are not met, no asset or liability is recognized. fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. accordingly, the company may be required to value assets at fair value measures that do not reflect the company's intended use of those assets. any excess of the purchase price (consideration transferred) over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. transaction costs and costs to restructure the acquired company are expensed as incurred. the operating results of the acquired business are reflected in the company's consolidated financial statements after the date of the merger or acquisition. the fair values of intangible assets, including acquired ipr&d, are determined utilizing information available near the merger or acquisition date based on expectations and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management. given the considerable judgment involved in determining fair values, the company typically obtains assistance from third-party valuation specialists for significant items. amounts allocated to acquired ipr&d are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets, subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the projects. upon successful completion of each project, merck will make a separate determination as to the then useful life of the asset and begin amortization. certain of the company's business acquisitions involve the potential for future payment of consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of performance milestones, including product development milestones and royalty payments on future product sales. the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is determined at the acquisition date using unobservable inputs. these inputs include the estimated amount and timing of projected cash flows, the probability of success (achievement of the contingent event) and the risk-adjusted discount rate used to present value the probability-weighted cash flows. subsequent to the acquisition date, at each reporting period, the contingent consideration liability is remeasured at current fair value with changes recorded in earnings. changes in any of the inputs may result in a significantly different fair value adjustment.
69
the judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, as well as asset lives, can materially affect the company's results of operations.
if the company determines the transaction will not be accounted for as an acquisition of a business, the transaction will be accounted for as an acquisition of assets rather than a business combination and, therefore, no goodwill will be recorded. in an asset acquisition, acquired ipr&d with no alternative future use is charged to expense at the acquisition date.
the fair values of identifiable intangible assets related to currently marketed products and product rights are primarily determined by using an "income approach" through which fair value is estimated based on each asset's discounted projected net cash flows. the company's estimates of market participant net cash flows consider historical and projected pricing, margins and expense levels; the performance of competing products where applicable; relevant industry and therapeutic area growth drivers and factors; current and expected trends in technology and product life cycles; the time and investment that will be required to develop products and technologies; the ability to obtain marketing and regulatory approvals; the ability to manufacture and commercialize the products; the extent and timing of potential new product introductions by the company's competitors; and the life of each asset's underlying patent, if any. the net cash flows are then probability-adjusted where appropriate to consider the uncertainties associated with the underlying assumptions, as well as the risk profile of the net cash flows utilized in the valuation. the probability-adjusted future net cash flows of each product are then discounted to present value utilizing an appropriate discount rate.
the fair values of identifiable intangible assets related to ipr&d are determined using an income approach, through which fair value is estimated based on each asset's probability-adjusted future net cash flows, which reflect the different stages of development of each product and the associated probability of successful completion. the net cash flows are then discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate.
revenue recognition revenues from sales of products are recognized when title and risk of loss passes to the customer, typically at time of delivery. recognition of revenue also requires reasonable assurance of collection of sales proceeds and completion of all performance obligations. domestically, sales discounts are issued to customers as direct discounts at the point-of-sale, indirectly through an intermediary wholesaler, known as chargebacks, or indirectly in the form of rebates. additionally, sales are generally made with a limited right of return under certain conditions. revenues are recorded net of provisions for sales discounts and returns, which are established at the time of sale. in addition, revenues are recorded net of time value of money discounts for customers for which collection of accounts receivable is expected to be in excess of one year.
the provision for aggregate indirect customer discounts covers chargebacks and rebates. chargebacks are discounts that occur when a contracted customer purchases directly through an intermediary wholesaler. the contracted customer generally purchases product at its contracted price plus a mark-up from the wholesaler. the wholesaler, in turn, charges the company back for the difference between the price initially paid by the wholesaler and the contract price paid to the wholesaler by the customer. the provision for chargebacks is based on expected sell-through levels by the company's wholesale customers to contracted customers, as well as estimated wholesaler inventory levels. rebates are amounts owed based upon definitive contractual agreements or legal requirements with private sector and public sector (medicaid and medicare part d) benefit providers, after the final dispensing of the product by a pharmacy to a benefit plan participant. the provision is based on expected payments, which are driven by patient usage and contract performance by the benefit provider customers.
the company uses historical customer segment mix, adjusted for other known events, in order to estimate the expected provision. amounts accrued for aggregate indirect customer discounts are evaluated on a quarterly basis through comparison of information provided by the wholesalers, health maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefit managers and other customers to the amounts accrued. adjustments are recorded when trends or significant events indicate that a change in the estimated provision is appropriate.
the company continually monitors its provision for aggregate indirect customer discounts. there were no material adjustments to estimates associated with the aggregate indirect customer discount provision in 2014, 2013 or 2012.
70
summarized information about changes in the aggregate indirect customer discount accrual is as follows:
($ in millions)                       2014   2013
balance january 1               $1,688              $1,873

balance december 31             $2,154              $1,688
accruals for chargebacks are reflected as a direct reduction to accounts receivable and accruals for rebates as current liabilities. the accrued balances relative to these provisions included in accounts receivable and accrued and other current liabilities were $112 million and $2.0 billion, respectively, at december 31, 2014 and were $87 million and $1.6 billion, respectively, at december 31, 2013.
the company maintains a returns policy that allows its u.s. pharmaceutical customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date (generally, three to six months before and 12 months after product expiration). the estimate of the provision for returns is based upon historical experience with actual returns. additionally, the company considers factors such as levels of inventory in the distribution channel, product dating and expiration period, whether products have been discontinued, entrance in the market of additional generic competition, changes in formularies or launch of over-the-counter products, among others. the product returns provision for u.s. pharmaceutical sales as a percentage of u.s. net pharmaceutical sales was 1.7% in 2014, 1.5% in 2013 and 1.4% in 2012.
through its distribution programs with u.s. wholesalers, the company encourages wholesalers to align purchases with underlying demand and maintain inventories below specified levels. the terms of the programs allow the wholesalers to earn fees upon providing visibility into their inventory levels, as well as by achieving certain performance parameters such as inventory management, customer service levels, reducing shortage claims and reducing product returns. information provided through the wholesaler distribution programs includes items such as sales trends, inventory on-hand, on-order quantity and product returns.
wholesalers generally provide only the above mentioned data to the company, as there is no regulatory requirement to report lot level information to manufacturers, which is the level of information needed to determine the remaining shelf life and original sale date of inventory. given current wholesaler inventory levels, which are generally less than a month, the company believes that collection of order lot information across all wholesale customers would have limited use in estimating sales discounts and returns.
inventories produced in preparation for product launches the company capitalizes inventories produced in preparation for product launches sufficient to support estimated initial market demand. typically, capitalization of such inventory does not begin until the related product candidates are in phase 3 clinical trials and are considered to have a high probability of regulatory approval. the company monitors the status of each respective product within the regulatory approval process; however, the company generally does not disclose specific timing for regulatory approval. if the company is aware of any specific risks or contingencies other than the normal regulatory approval process or if there are any specific issues identified during the research process relating to safety, efficacy, manufacturing, marketing or labeling, the related inventory would generally not be capitalized. expiry dates of the inventory are affected by the stage of completion. the company manages the levels of inventory at each stage to optimize the shelf life of the inventory in relation to anticipated market demand in order to avoid product expiry issues. for inventories that are capitalized, anticipated future sales and shelf lives support the realization of the inventory value as the inventory shelf life is sufficient to meet initial product launch requirements. inventories produced in preparation for product launches capitalized at december 31, 2014 and 2013 were $74 million and $177 million, respectively.
contingencies and environmental liabilities the company is involved in various claims and legal proceedings of a nature considered normal to its business, including product liability, intellectual property and commercial litigation, as well as certain additional matters (see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.) the company records accruals for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. these accruals are adjusted periodically as assessments change or additional information becomes available. for product liability claims, a portion
71
of the overall accrual is actuarially determined and considers such factors as past experience, number of claims reported and estimates of claims incurred but not yet reported. individually significant contingent losses are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable.
legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable. some of the significant factors considered in the review of these legal defense reserves are as follows: the actual costs incurred by the company; the development of the company's legal defense strategy and structure in light of the scope of its litigation; the number of cases being brought against the company; the costs and outcomes of completed trials and the most current information regarding anticipated timing, progression, and related costs of pre-trial activities and trials in the associated litigation. the amount of legal defense reserves as of december 31, 2014 and 2013 of approximately $215 million and $160 million, respectively, represents the company's best estimate of the minimum amount of defense costs to be incurred in connection with its outstanding litigation; however, events such as additional trials and other events that could arise in the course of its litigation could affect the ultimate amount of legal defense costs to be incurred by the company. the company will continue to monitor its legal defense costs and review the adequacy of the associated reserves and may determine to increase the reserves at any time in the future if, based upon the factors set forth, it believes it would be appropriate to do so.
the company and its subsidiaries are parties to a number of proceedings brought under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act, commonly known as superfund, and other federal and state equivalents. when a legitimate claim for contribution is asserted, a liability is initially accrued based upon the estimated transaction costs to manage the site. accruals are adjusted as site investigations, feasibility studies and related cost assessments of remedial techniques are completed, and as the extent to which other potentially responsible parties who may be jointly and severally liable can be expected to contribute is determined.
the company is also remediating environmental contamination resulting from past industrial activity at certain of its sites and takes an active role in identifying and providing for these costs. in the past, merck performed a worldwide survey to assess all sites for potential contamination resulting from past industrial activities. where assessment indicated that physical investigation was warranted, such investigation was performed, providing a better evaluation of the need for remedial action. where such need was identified, remedial action was then initiated. as definitive information became available during the course of investigations and/or remedial efforts at each site, estimates were refined and accruals were established or adjusted accordingly. these estimates and related accruals continue to be refined annually.
the company believes that there are no compliance issues associated with applicable environmental laws and regulations that would have a material adverse effect on the company. expenditures for remediation and environmental liabilities were $12 million in 2014, and are estimated at $53 million in the aggregate for the years 2015 through 2019. in management's opinion, the liabilities for all environmental matters that are probable and reasonably estimable have been accrued and totaled $125 million and $213 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. these liabilities are undiscounted, do not consider potential recoveries from other parties and will be paid out over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites, which are expected to occur primarily over the next 15 years. although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these matters, or the ultimate costs of remediation, management does not believe that any reasonably possible expenditures that may be incurred in excess of the liabilities accrued should exceed $66 million in the aggregate. management also does not believe that these expenditures should result in a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources for any year.
share-based compensation the company expenses all share-based payment awards to employees, including grants of stock options, over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value of the awards. the company determines the fair value of certain share-based awards using the black-scholes option-pricing model which uses both historical and current market data to estimate the fair value. this method incorporates various assumptions such as the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, expected dividend yield and expected life of the options. total pretax share-based compensation expense was $278 million in 2014, $276 million in 2013 and $335 million in 2012. at december 31, 2014, there was $401 million of total pretax unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested stock option, restricted stock unit and performance share unit awards which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.9 years. for segment reporting, share-based compensation costs are unallocated expenses.

pensions and other postretirement benefit plans net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled $169 million in 2014, $716 million in 2013 and $509 million in 2012. pension and other postretirement benefit plan information for financial reporting purposes is calculated using actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan benefit obligations and an expected rate of return on plan assets. the decrease in net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefit plans in 2014 as compared with 2013 is largely attributable to a change in the discount rate.
the company reassesses its benefit plan assumptions on a regular basis. for both the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, the discount rate is evaluated on measurement dates and modified to reflect the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality fixed-income debt instruments that would provide the future cash flows needed to pay the benefits included in the benefit obligation as they come due. at december 31, 2014, the discount rates for the company's u.s. pension and other postretirement benefit plans ranged from 3.20% to 4.20% compared with a range of 3.60% to 5.20% at december 31, 2013.
the expected rate of return for both the pension and other postretirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. in developing the expected rate of return, the company considers long-term compound annualized returns of historical market data as well as actual returns on the company's plan assets. using this reference information, the company develops forward-looking return expectations for each asset category and a weighted-average expected long-term rate of return for a target portfolio allocated across these investment categories. the expected portfolio performance reflects the contribution of active management as appropriate. as a result of this analysis, for 2015, the company's expected rate of return will range from 7.30% to 8.75%, the same range as in 2014 for its u.s. pension and other postretirement benefit plans.
in october 2014, the society of actuaries issued new retirement plan mortality assumptions that are used in measuring u.s. pension plan obligations. the company has reflected an impact of these new assumptions in the measurement of its u.s. pension plan obligations at december 31, 2014.
the company has established investment guidelines for its u.s. pension and other postretirement plans to create an asset allocation that is expected to deliver a rate of return sufficient to meet the long-term obligation of each plan, given an acceptable level of risk. the target investment portfolio of the company's u.s. pension and other postretirement benefit plans is allocated 40% to 60% in u.s. equities, 20% to 40% in international equities, 15% to 25% in fixed-income investments, and up to 5% in cash and other investments. the portfolio's equity weighting is consistent with the long-term nature of the plans' benefit obligations. the expected annual standard deviation of returns of the target portfolio, which approximates 13%, reflects both the equity allocation and the diversification benefits among the asset classes in which the portfolio invests. for non-u.s. pension plans, the targeted investment portfolio varies based on the duration of pension liabilities and local government rules and regulations. although a significant percentage of plan assets are invested in u.s. equities, concentration risk is mitigated through the use of strategies that are diversified within management guidelines.
actuarial assumptions are based upon management's best estimates and judgment. a reasonably possible change of plus (minus) 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $46 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on its net periodic benefit cost. a reasonably possible change of plus (minus) 25 basis points in the expected rate of return assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $23 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on its net periodic benefit cost. required funding obligations for 2015 relating to the company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans are not expected to be material. the preceding hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected rate of return assumptions would not impact the company's funding requirements.
net loss amounts, which reflect experience differentials primarily relating to differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recorded as a component of aoci. expected returns for pension plans are based on a calculated market-related value of assets. under this methodology, asset gains/losses resulting from actual returns that differ from the company's expected returns are recognized in the market-related value of assets ratably over a five-year period. also, net loss amounts in aoci in excess of certain thresholds are amortized into net periodic benefit cost over the average remaining service life of employees.

restructuring costs restructuring costs have been recorded in connection with restructuring programs designed to reduce the cost structure, increase efficiency and enhance competitiveness. as a result, the company has made estimates and judgments regarding its future plans, including future termination benefits and other exit costs to be incurred when the restructuring actions take place. when accruing these costs, the company will recognize the amount within a range of costs that is the best estimate within the range. when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the company recognizes the minimum amount within the range. in connection with these actions, management also assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business. in certain instances, asset lives have been shortened based on changes in the expected useful lives of the affected assets. severance and other related costs are reflected within restructuring costs. asset-related charges are reflected within materials and production costs, marketing and administrative expenses and research and development expenses depending upon the nature of the asset.
impairments of long-lived assets the company assesses changes in economic, regulatory and legal conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the company's property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets.
the company periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying values of its long-lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. if such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows of these assets, or appropriate asset groupings, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. if the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset's fair value and its carrying value. if quoted market prices are not available, the company will estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows approach.
goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets of businesses purchased and is assigned to reporting units. the company tests its goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist, by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macro economic conditions, conditions specific to the industry and market, cost factors which could have a significant effect on earnings or cash flows, the overall financial performance of the reporting unit, and whether there have been sustained declines in the company's share price. additionally, the company evaluates the extent to which the fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit at the last date a valuation was performed. if the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative fair value test is performed.
other acquired intangibles (excluding ipr&d) are recorded at fair value, assigned an estimated useful life, and are amortized primarily on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. when events or circumstances warrant a review, the company will assess recoverability from future operations using pretax undiscounted cash flows derived from the lowest appropriate asset groupings. impairments are recognized in operating results to the extent that the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, which is determined based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows.
ipr&d that the company acquires through business combinations represents the fair value assigned to incomplete research projects which, at the time of acquisition, have not reached technological feasibility. the amounts are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets, subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the project. the company tests ipr&d for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist, by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the ipr&d intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. if the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount, a quantitative test that compares the fair value of the ipr&d intangible asset with its carrying value is performed. for impairment testing purposes, the company may combine separately recorded ipr&d intangible assets into one unit of account based on the relevant facts and circumstances. generally, the company will combine ipr&d intangible assets for testing purposes if they operate as a single asset and are essentially inseparable. if the fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized within the company's operating results.

the judgments made in evaluating impairment of long-lived intangibles can materially affect the company's results of operations.
impairments of investments the company reviews its investments for impairments based on the determination of whether the decline in market value of the investment below the carrying value is other-than-temporary. the company considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairments of its investments, including the duration and extent to which fair value is less than cost and, for equity securities, the company's ability and intent to hold the investments. for debt securities, an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred if the company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the debt security. if the company does not intend to sell the impaired debt security, and it is not more likely than not it will be required to sell the debt security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis, the amount of the other-than-temporary impairment recognized in earnings is limited to the portion attributed to credit loss. the remaining portion of the other-than-temporary impairment related to other factors is recognized in oci.
taxes on income the company's effective tax rate is based on pretax income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates. an estimated effective tax rate for a year is applied to the company's quarterly operating results. in the event that there is a significant unusual or one-time item recognized, or expected to be recognized, in the company's quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as the unusual or one-time item. the company considers the resolution of prior year tax matters to be such items. significant judgment is required in determining the company's tax provision and in evaluating its tax positions. the recognition and measurement of a tax position is based on management's best judgment given the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. the company evaluates tax positions to determine whether the benefits of tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the company recognizes the largest amount of the benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements. for tax positions that are not more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the company does not recognize any portion of the benefit in the financial statements. if the more likely than not threshold is not met in the period for which a tax position is taken, the company may subsequently recognize the benefit of that tax position if the tax matter is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires, or if the more likely than not threshold is met in a subsequent period (see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.)
tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which the company has already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. the company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred or expense for which the company has already taken a deduction on the tax return, but has not yet recognized as expense in the financial statements. at december 31, 2014, foreign earnings of $60.0 billion have been retained indefinitely by subsidiary companies for reinvestment; therefore, no provision has been made for income taxes that would be payable upon the distribution of such earnings and it would not be practicable to determine the amount of the related unrecognized deferred income tax liability.
recently issued accounting standards in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board issued amended accounting guidance on revenue recognition that will be applied to all contracts with customers. the objective of the new guidance is to improve comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities and to provide more useful information to users of financial statements through improved disclosure requirements. this guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning in 2017. early adoption is not permitted. the company is currently assessing the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.

cautionary factors that may affect future results this report and other written reports and oral statements made from time to time by the company may contain so-called "forward-looking statements," all of which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause results to differ materially from those set forth in the statements. one can identify these forward-looking statements by their use of words such as "anticipates," "expects," "plans," "will," "estimates," "forecasts," "projects" and other words of similar meaning. one can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. these statements are likely to address the company's growth strategy, financial results, product development, product approvals, product potential and development programs. one must carefully consider any such statement and should understand that many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the company's forward-looking statements. these factors include inaccurate assumptions and a broad variety of other risks and uncertainties, including some that are known and some that are not. no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual future results may vary materially.
the company does not assume the obligation to update any forward-looking statement. one should carefully evaluate such statements in light of factors, including risk factors, described in the company's filings with the securities and exchange commission, especially on this form 10-k and forms 10-q and 8-k. in item 1a. "risk factors" of this annual report on form 10-k the company discusses in more detail various important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historic results. the company notes these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. one should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. consequently, the reader should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties.

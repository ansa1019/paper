item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report and the matters described under item 1a. risk factors.
management's overview we believe the scale and quality of our operating platform, the skills of our team and the strength of our balance sheet give us unique competitive advantages. our plan to grow revenue, earnings, net operating income ("noi"), cash flows and core ffo (see below for definition) is based on:
                                                          rising rents. market rents are increasing across many of our markets. we expect growth to continue as demand for logistics facilities is strong across the globe. as many of our leases originated during low rent period following the global financial crisis, there is considerable room for growth of in-place leases, which translates into increased noi, earnings and cash flow. we had positive rent change on rollovers (when comparing the net effective rent of the new lease to the prior lease for the same space) during each quarter of 2014, ranging between 6.2% and 9.7%, and the fourth quarter marked the eighth consecutive quarter of positive rental increases.
                                                       value creation from development. we believe a successful development program involves maintaining control of well-positioned land. based on our current estimates, our land bank has the potential to support the development of nearly 180 million additional square feet. we believe the carrying value of our land bank is below its current fair value, and we expect to realize this value going forward through development or land sales. during 2014, in our owned and managed portfolio, we stabilized development projects with a total expected investment of $1.1 billion. we estimate that post-stabilization, the value of these buildings will be approximately 23.0% more than their book value or the cost to develop (defined as estimated margin and calculated using estimated yield and capitalization rates from our underwriting models).
                                                      economies of scale from growth in assets under management. we believe we have the infrastructure and an acquisition pipeline that will allow us to increase our investments in real estate, with minimal increases to general and administrative expenses. during 2014, our owned and managed real estate assets increased through the acquisition of $1.5 billion of buildings, principally in our unconsolidated ventures in europe, and development starts with a total expected investment of $2.0 billion; offset partially by dispositions to third parties of $1.5 billion. with all of this activity, we had minimal incremental gross general and administrative expenses.
summary of 2014
during the year ended december 31, 2014, we completed the following activities as further described in the consolidated financial statements:
                                  in january, we closed on a u.s. co-investment venture, prologis u.s. logistics venture ("uslv"), in which we have a 55% equity ownership and consolidate for financial reporting purposes. at closing, the venture acquired a portfolio of 66 operating properties from us, aggregating 12.8 million square feet for a purchase price of $1.0 billion.
                                                      in june, we completed the initial public offering for fibra prologis, a mexican reit on the mexican stock exchange. in connection with the offering, fibra prologis purchased its initial portfolio of $1.6 billion from us and two of our co-investment ventures. we received equity units in fibra prologis in exchange for our combined investments resulting in a 45% ownership interest in fibra prologis that we account for under the equity method.
                                            we earned a promote of $42.1 million in june from our co-investment venture, prologis targeted u.s. logistics fund ("uslf"), which was based on the venture's cumulative returns to the investors over the previous three calendar years. of that amount, $31.3 million represented the third-party investors' portion and is reflected in strategic capital income in the consolidated statements of operations.
                                                          we increased our ownership of prologis north american industrial fund ("naif") to 66.1% by acquiring equity units from all but one partner for an aggregate purchase price of $679.0 million, which resulted in us obtaining control over and consolidating naif. as a result of remeasuring our equity investment to fair value upon consolidation in the fourth quarter, we recognized a gain of
$201.3 million.
   we invested $587.2 million in three of our european unconsolidated co-investment ventures, which represented our proportionate ownership interest, for the acquisition of properties and repayment of debt.
                       we generated net proceeds of $3.2 billion and net gains of $524.5 million from the contribution and disposition of real estate investments, including the initial portfolio of fibra prologis discussed above. the gains were principally driven by dispositions in the united states and contribution of stabilized properties in japan and mexico.

                                                      we issued 1.8 billion ($2.4 billion) of senior notes, entered into a new yen term loan and replaced our euro term loan. we used the net proceeds to buy back senior notes through private transactions, repay secured mortgage debt, fund additional investments in our co-investment ventures and for general corporate purposes. this activity reduced our weighted average interest rate and extended our maturities, as further discussed below in liquidity and capital resources.
                                     in december, we received proceeds of $353.9 million through the issuance of equity securities from the exercise of a warrant issued in connection with the formation of prologis european logistics partners sàrl ("pelp") and through our at-the-market ("atm") program. see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our atm program.
results of operations real estate operations included in this segment is rental income and rental expense recognized from our consolidated operating properties. we had significant real estate activity during 2014 and 2013 that impacted the size of our consolidated portfolio. in addition, the operating fundamentals in the markets of our operating portfolio have been improving, which has positively impacted both the occupancy and rental rates we have experienced, and has also fueled development activity. also included in this segment is revenue from land we own and lease to customers and development management and other income, net of acquisition, disposition and land holding costs.

below are the key drivers of real estate operations noi:
   we had significant activity within the portfolio, including acquisitions, contributions to co-investment ventures and dispositions to third parties.
this impacted noi as follows:
2014 as compared to 2013
   acquisitions and development activity: $84.8 million increase;
   consolidation of naif: $35.8 million increase;
   contribution activity: $140.3 million decrease;
   disposition activity: $44.0 million decrease
2013 as compared to 2012
   acquisitions and development activity: $71.6 million increase;
   contribution activity: $299.4 million decrease
   average occupancy in our operating properties increased 90 basis points in 2014 from 2013 and 100 basis points in 2013 from 2012.
   we leased a total of 72.9 million square feet, 87.6 million square feet and 92.4 million square feet during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
                                                    we recognize changes in rental income from certain contractual rent increases from our existing leases and from rent change on new leases. if a lease has a contractual rent increase based on the consumer price index or similar metric that is not known at the time of lease signing, the rent increase is not included in rent leveling and therefore any rent increase will impact the rental income we recognize.
23
   we have experienced an increase in rental rates on the turnover of existing leases for the last eight quarters that has resulted in higher average rental rates in our portfolio and increased rental income and noi as those leases commenced.
                                                under the terms of our lease agreements, we are able to recover the majority of our rental expenses from customers. rental expense recoveries, included in both rental income and rental expenses, were 81.0%, 73.4% and 74.2% of total rental expenses for the year ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 respectively. the increase was due in part to the higher average occupancy of our portfolio.
                                   we adopted a new accounting standard, as of january 1, 2014, that changed the criteria for classifying and reporting discontinued operations. the results of the third-party dispositions remained in continuing operations in 2014, whereas in 2013 and 2012, the results were reclassified to discontinued operations and not included in real estate operations.
strategic capital included in this segment is income comprised of fees and promotes earned for services performed for our unconsolidated co-investment ventures reduced by the expenses recognized for the direct costs associated with the asset management of these ventures and allocated property-level management costs for the properties owned by the ventures. income associated with strategic capital fluctuates due to the size of co-investment ventures that are under management, the transactional activity in the venture and the timing of promotes. we had significant co-investment venture activity in 2014 and 2013 that impacted strategic capital noi as detailed below.
strategic capital noi for the years ended december 31 was as follows (in thousands):

below are the key drivers of strategic capital noi:
   we acquired a controlling interest in our co-investment venture naif in the fourth quarter of 2014 and began consolidating the venture.
   we formed the co-investment venture fibra prologis in mexico in june 2014 and in connection with this transaction, we concluded the mexico industrial fund.
   we acquired a controlling interest in prologis sgp mexico and purchased our partner's interest in prologis north american industrial fund iii in
2013.
   we formed two co-investment ventures in early 2013 (one in europe and one in japan). in connection with the formation of the japan co-investment venture, we concluded japan fund i.
   we contributed 126, 254 and 25 properties to several co-investment ventures during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
   in june 2014, we earned a promote of $42.1 million from our co-investment venture uslf. of that amount, $31.3 million represented the third-party investors' portion and is reflected in strategic capital income in the consolidated statements of operations.
the direct costs associated with strategic capital totaled $96.5 million, $89.3 million and $63.8 million for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and are included in the line item strategic capital expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. these expenses include the direct expenses associated with asset management of the unconsolidated co-investment ventures and the property management expenses associated with the property-level management of the properties owned by these ventures.
the increase in strategic capital expenses in 2014 from 2013 was due to the increased size of our co-investment ventures and additional expense that represents the associated bonus paid pursuant to the terms of the prologis promote plan for the promote we earned, offset partially by the conclusion of several ventures. the increase in strategic capital expenses in 2013 from 2012 was due to the addition of the two co-investment ventures in europe and asia and additional expense related to the promote we earned, offset somewhat by the conclusion of several ventures.
see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our unconsolidated entities.
our owned and managed portfolio we manage our business on an owned and managed basis without regard to whether a particular property is wholly-owned by us or owned by one of our co-investment ventures. as further discussed below, we believe that the operating fundamentals of our owned and managed portfolio are consistent with those of our consolidated portfolio. the activity in our owned and managed portfolio impacts real estate operations noi, strategic capital revenues and the net earnings we recognize from our unconsolidated co-investment ventures.

same store analysis we evaluate the performance of the operating properties we own and manage using a "same store" analysis because the population of properties in this analysis is consistent from period to period, thereby eliminating the effects of changes in the composition of the portfolio on performance measures. we include properties from our consolidated portfolio, as well as properties owned by the unconsolidated co-investment ventures that are managed by us, in our same store analysis. we have defined the same store portfolio, for the three months ended december 31, 2014, as those properties that were in operation at january 1, 2013, and have been in operation throughout the same three-month periods in both 2014 and 2013. we have removed all properties that were disposed of to a third party or were classified as held for sale from the population for both periods. we believe the factors that impact rental income, rental expenses and noi in the same store portfolio are generally the same as for the total portfolio. in order to derive an appropriate measure of period-to-period operating performance, we remove the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements by using the current exchange rate to translate from local currency into u.s. dollars, for both periods.
we calculate our same store results on a quarterly basis and provide a reconciliation of those results to our consolidated statements of operations. the following is a summary of same store noi and the change from prior period for the four quarters of 2014 and on a cumulative year-to-date basis and the square feet of the portfolio used in the calculation (dollars and square feet in thousands):

(1)   as discussed above, our same store portfolio includes industrial properties from our consolidated portfolio and owned by the unconsolidated co-investment ventures that are managed by us. during the periods presented, certain properties owned by us were
27
contributed to a co-investment venture and are included in the same store portfolio on an aggregate basis. neither our consolidated results nor those of the co-investment ventures, when viewed individually, would be comparable on a same store basis due to the changes in composition of the respective portfolios from period to period (for example, the results of a contributed property are included in our consolidated results through the contribution date and in the results of the unconsolidated entities subsequent to the contribution date).
(2)                                           we exclude the net termination and renegotiation fees from our same store rental income to allow us to evaluate the growth or decline in each property's rental income without regard to items that are not indicative of the property's recurring operating performance. net termination and renegotiation fees represent the gross fee negotiated to allow a customer to terminate or renegotiate their lease, offset by the write-off of the asset recorded due to the adjustment to straight-line rents over the lease term. the adjustments to remove these items are included in "effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other" in the above table.
(3)                                            rental expenses include the direct operating expenses of the property such as property taxes, insurance, utilities, etc. in addition, we include an allocation of the property management expenses for our direct-owned properties based on the property management services provided to each property (generally, based on a percentage of revenues). on consolidation, these amounts are eliminated and the actual costs of providing property management services are recognized as part of our consolidated rental expenses. these expenses fluctuate based on the level of properties included in the same store portfolio and any adjustment is included as "effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other" in the above table.
other components of income general and administrative ("g&a") expenses g&a expenses for the years ended december 31 consisted of the following (in thousands):
2014                  2013                  2012

capitalized amounts                                 (87,308)              (83,530)              (67,003)
g&amp;a expenses                                    $247,768              $229,207              $228,068
gross overhead includes all costs related to our business, including the real estate operations and strategic capital segments. we allocate a portion of our gross overhead that relates to property management functions to both segments based on the size of the respective portfolios. costs directly associated to strategic capital are allocated to that segment.
the increase in gross overhead from 2013 to 2014 was principally due to increased compensation. the increase in gross overhead from 2012 to 2013 was primarily due to increased infrastructure to accommodate our growing business. in 2013, the gross book value for our owned and managed portfolio increased $1.4 billion to $45.5 billion at december 31, 2013.
we capitalize certain costs directly related to our development and leasing activities. capitalized g&a expenses included salaries and related costs, as well as other general and administrative costs. the capitalized g&a costs for the years ended december 31 were as follows (in thousands):
2014               2013               2012
development activities                                    $68,008            $64,113            $42,417
leasing activities                                         17,888             18,301             23,183
costs related to internally developed software              1,412              1,116              1,403
total capitalized g&amp;a expenses                        $87,308            $83,530            $67,003
in 2014, 2013 and 2012, the capitalized salaries and related costs represented 23.9%, 23.7% and 20.3%, respectively, of our total salaries and related costs, which includes cash and equity compensation and other employee-related expenses.
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization was $642.5 million, $648.7 million and $724.3 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the decrease over the last two years was principally a result of the disposition and contribution of properties, offset slightly by additional depreciation and amortization from completed development and acquired properties.
28
merger, acquisition and other integration expenses we incurred significant transaction, integration and transitional costs in 2012 related to the merger in 2011 and integration of systems. see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for more detail on these expenses.
impairment of real estate properties during 2012, we recognized impairment charges of real estate properties in continuing operations due to our change of intent to no longer hold certain assets for long-term investment. see notes 2 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements for more detail on the process we took to value these assets and the related impairment charges recognized.
earnings from unconsolidated entities, net we recognized net earnings from unconsolidated entities that are accounted for under the equity method of $134.3 million, $97.2 million and $31.7 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the earnings we recognize are impacted by: (i) changes in revenues and expenses of each venture; (ii) the size and occupancy rate of the portfolio of properties owned by each venture; (iii) our ownership interest in each venture; and (iv) fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates used to translate our share of net earnings to u.s. dollars, if applicable. see the discussion of our co-investment ventures above in the strategic capital segment discussion and in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a further breakdown of our share of net earnings recognized.
interest expense gross interest expense decreased in 2014, compared to 2013, due to lower average debt levels and a decrease in interest rates. although our debt levels were consistent at year ends ($9.4 billion at december 31, 2014 compared to $9.0 billion at december 31, 2013), we had higher debt outstanding during the first quarter of 2013. we decreased our debt by $2.7 billion near the end of the first quarter of 2013, primarily from the proceeds received from the contributions made to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures.
gross interest expense decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 due to lower debt levels.
our weighted average effective interest rate was 4.2%, 4.7% and 4.6% for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. during 2014, 2013 and 2012, we issued new debt with lower borrowing costs and used the proceeds to pay down or buy back our higher cost debt.
see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a further breakdown of gross interest expense, amortization and capitalized amounts included in net interest expense.
see also liquidity and capital resources for further discussion of our debt and borrowing costs.
gains on dispositions of investments in real estate and revaluation of equity investments upon acquisition of a controlling interest, net we recognized $0.7 billion, $0.6 billion and $0.3 billion in continuing operations during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. in 2014, these also included gains on the dispositions of properties to third parties due to the change in reporting under the new accounting standard. we expect to have contributions to co-investments in the future, primarily in europe, japan and mexico, as well as the disposition of properties to third parties, primarily in the u.s., all depending on market conditions and other factors. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the gains we recognized.
foreign currency and derivative gains (losses), net to mitigate our foreign currency exchange exposure, we borrow in the functional currency of the borrowing entity when appropriate. however, we and certain of our foreign consolidated subsidiaries have intercompany or third-party debt that is not denominated in the entity's functional currency. when the debt is remeasured against the functional currency of the entity, a gain or loss may result. certain of our third-party and intercompany debt is remeasured with the resulting adjustment recognized as a cumulative translation adjustment in foreign currency translation losses, net in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). this treatment is applicable to third-party debt that is designated as a hedge of our net investment and intercompany debt that is deemed to be long-term in nature.
if the third-party debt is not designated as a hedge or the intercompany debt is deemed short-term in nature we recognize a gain or loss in earnings when the debt is remeasured. we recognized net foreign currency exchange losses of $4.5 million in 2014 and exchange gains of $9.2 million and $7.4 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively, related to the settlement and remeasurement of debt. predominantly the gains or losses recognized in earnings relate to the remeasurement of intercompany loans between the united states parent and certain consolidated subsidiaries in japan and europe and result from fluctuations in the exchange rates of u.s. dollar to the euro, japanese yen and british pound sterling. in addition, we recognized net foreign currency exchange losses of $0.6 million, $0.6 million and $5.6 million from the settlement of transactions with third parties of certain assets or liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than an entity's functional currency in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
we recognized unrealized losses of $13.3 million, $42.2 million and $22.3 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively on the derivative instrument (exchange feature) related to our exchangeable senior notes, which are due in march 2015.
29
gains (losses) on early extinguishment of debt, net during 2014, 2013 and 2012, we purchased portions of several series of senior notes, senior exchangeable notes and extinguished some secured mortgage debt prior to maturity, which resulted in the recognition of losses of $165.3 million, $277.0 million and $14.1 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our debt repurchases.
income tax benefit (expense)
during 2014, 2013 and 2012, our current income tax expense was $61.6 million, $126.2 million and $17.9 million, respectively. we recognize current income tax expense for income taxes incurred by our taxable reit subsidiaries ("trss"), state and local income taxes and taxes incurred in our foreign jurisdictions. our current income tax expense fluctuates from period to period based primarily on the timing of our taxable income. current income tax expense recognized during 2014 is principally due to tax triggered upon the contribution of the initial portfolio of properties by certain wholly-owned entities and mexico fondo logistico ("afores") to fibra prologis, as the transaction was structured as an asset sale for mexican tax purposes. the tax expense was offset slightly by the net current tax benefit from the operating losses generated by our united states trs. the current tax expense recognized during 2013 was due to the initial contribution of certain properties to pelp and npr that were previously held in foreign jurisdictions and united states trss.
during 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recognized a deferred tax benefit of $87.2 million, $19.4 million and $14.3 million, respectively. deferred income tax benefit (expense) is generally a function of the period's temporary differences and the utilization of net operating losses generated in prior years that had been previously recognized as deferred income tax assets in taxable subsidiaries operating in the united states or in foreign jurisdictions. during 2014, the majority of the deferred tax benefit we recognized was a result of the reversal of deferred tax liabilities of $62.8 million as part of the fibra prologis transaction ($30.4 million was offset by current income tax expense) and $27.1 million due to the expiration of the holding period on properties previously acquired with existing built-in gains.
our income taxes are discussed in more detail in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.
discontinued operations as discussed above, we adopted a new accounting standard regarding discontinued operations effective january 1, 2014, and none of our property dispositions in 2014 met the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations. in 2014, 2013 and 2012, earnings from discontinued operations were $123.5 million and $75.9 million, respectively. discontinued operations under the previous standard represent the results of operations of properties that were sold to third parties along with the related gain or loss on sale.
net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests this amount represents the third-party investors' share of the earnings generated in consolidated ventures in which we do not own 100% of the equity, as well as the limited partners' interests in the operating partnership. in 2014, we recognized net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in afores of $64.8 million due to the fibra prologis transaction, primarily related to the third-party investors' share of the gain on disposition and the net deferred income tax benefit.
in 2013, we earned a promote of $18.8 million from the cumulative returns of the investors of our consolidated co-investment venture, prologis institutional alliance fund ii, over the life of the venture. of that amount, $13.5 million represents the third-party investors' portion and is reflected as a component of noncontrolling interest.
see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our consolidated co-investment ventures.
other comprehensive income (loss)  foreign currency translation losses, net we recognized unrealized gains or losses related to the translation of our foreign subsidiaries' assets and liabilities into u.s. dollars, along with realized and unrealized gains or losses associated with the changes in the fair value of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations. during 2014, we recorded net losses of $171.4 million principally due to the weakening of the japanese yen, euro and british pound sterling to the u.s. dollar, from the beginning of the period to the end of the period. in 2013, we recorded net losses of $234.7 million, which included approximately $190 million of foreign currency translation losses on the properties contributed to pelp and npr due to the weakening of the euro and japanese yen, respectively, to the u.s. dollar from december 31, 2012, through the date of the contributions. also in 2013, we recorded net unrealized losses due to the weakening of the japanese yen to the u.s. dollar, from the beginning of the period to the end of the period. during 2012, we recorded net losses of $79.0 million as the japanese yen weakened relative to the u.s. dollar, offset slightly by the euro and british pound sterling slightly strengthening against the u.s. dollar, from the beginning of the period to the end of the period. see note 18 in the consolidated financial statements for further detail.
environmental matters a majority of the properties acquired by us were subjected to environmental reviews either by us or the previous owners. while some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling, none of the environmental assessments have revealed an environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
see note 19 in the consolidated financial statements for further information about environmental liabilities.

liquidity and capital resources overview we consider our ability to generate cash from operating activities, dispositions of properties and from available financing sources to be adequate to meet our anticipated future development, acquisition, operating, debt service, dividend and distribution requirements.
near-term principal cash sources and uses in addition to dividends to the common and preferred stockholders of prologis and distributions to the holders of limited partnership units of the operating partnership and other partnerships, we expect our primary cash needs will consist of the following:
                                             repayment of debt, including payments on our credit facilities and scheduled principal payments in 2015 of $599 million (which includes $460 million due march 15, 2015, on exchangeable/convertible notes that are exchangeable/convertible at a rate of 25.8244 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (equivalent to an exchange or conversion price of $38.72));
                                     completion of the development and leasing of the properties in our consolidated development portfolio (we had 79 properties at december 31, 2014, in our development portfolio that were 46.7% leased with a current investment of $1.5 billion and a total expected investment of $2.5 billion when completed and leased, leaving $1.0 billion remaining to be spent);
   development of new properties for long-term investment, including the acquisition of land in certain markets;
   capital expenditures and leasing costs on properties in our operating portfolio;
   additional investments in current unconsolidated entities or new investments in future unconsolidated entities;
   depending on market and other conditions, acquisition of operating properties and/or portfolios of operating properties in global or regional markets for direct, long-term investment in our consolidated portfolio (this might include acquisitions from our co-investment ventures); and
   depending on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors, we may repurchase our outstanding debt or equity securities through cash purchases, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers or otherwise.
we expect to fund our cash needs principally from the following sources, all subject to market conditions:
   available unrestricted cash balances ($350.7 million at december 31, 2014);
   property operations;
   fees earned for services performed on behalf of the co-investment ventures and distributions received from the co-investment ventures;
   proceeds from the disposition of properties, land parcels or other investments to third parties;
   proceeds from the contributions of properties to current or future co-investment ventures;
   borrowing capacity under our current credit facility arrangements discussed below ($2.7 billion available at december 31, 2014), other facilities or borrowing arrangements;
   proceeds from the issuance of equity securities, including through the atm program (we issued 3.3 million shares of common stock in 2014, generating net proceeds of $140.1 million  see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for details on this program); and
   proceeds from the issuance of debt securities, including secured mortgage debt.
debt debt balances at december 31 consisted of the following (dollars in millions):

we used the proceeds from these issuances to repay or redeem $1.3 billion of outstanding senior notes scheduled to mature in 2015 through 2022, secured mortgage debt of $528.0 million, fund additional investments in our co-investment ventures and general corporate purposes.
in 2014, we terminated our existing senior term loan agreement and entered into a new agreement under which loans can be obtained in u.s. dollars, euro, japanese yen and british pounds sterling in an aggregate amount not to exceed 500 million ($607.1 million at december 31, 2014). we may pay down and re-borrow under this arrangement. we had borrowings of 190 million ($230.7 million at december 31, 2014). we also entered into a japanese yen term loan under which we may obtain loans in an aggregate amount not to exceed ¥40.9 billion ($342.1 million at december 31, 2014). we had fully drawn this term loan at december 31, 2014.
at december 31, 2014, we had credit facilities with an aggregate borrowing capacity of $2.7 billion, all of which was available for borrowing.
at december 31, 2014, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants, which include customary financial covenants for total debt ratios, encumbered debt ratios and fixed charge coverage ratios.
see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our debt.
equity commitments related to certain co-investment ventures certain co-investment ventures have equity commitments from us and our venture partners. our venture partners fulfill their equity commitment with cash. we may fulfill our equity commitment through contributions of properties or cash. for more information on equity commitments for our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. we have one consolidated co-investment venture, the brazil fund, with equity commitments at december 31, 2014, of $75.4 million, of which $37.7 million is our share and expires in december 2017. the equity commitments are denominated in brazilian real and called and reported in u.s. dollars.

at december 31, 2014, we did not guarantee any third-party debt of the co-investment ventures. in our role as the manager, we work with the co-investment ventures to refinance their maturing debt. there can be no assurance that the co-investment ventures will be able to refinance any maturing indebtedness on terms as favorable as the maturing debt, or at all. if the ventures are unable to refinance the maturing indebtedness with newly issued debt, they may be able to obtain funds by voluntary capital contributions from us and our partners or by selling assets. certain of the ventures also have credit facilities, or unencumbered properties, both of which may be used to obtain funds.

(1)                                                 we had properties in our development portfolio (completed and under development) at december 31, 2014, with a total expected investment of $2.5 billion. the unfunded commitments presented include not only those costs that we are obligated to fund under construction contracts, but all costs necessary to place the property into service, including the estimated costs of tenant improvements, marketing and leasing costs that we will incur as the property is leased.

distribution and dividend requirements our dividend policy on our common stock is to distribute a percentage of our cash flow to ensure we will meet the dividend requirements of the internal revenue code, relative to maintaining our real estate investment trust status, while still allowing us to retain cash to meet other needs such as capital improvements and other investment activities.
in 2014 and 2013, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.33 and $0.28 per common share, respectively. our future common stock dividends may vary and will be determined by our board of directors upon the circumstances prevailing at the time, including our financial condition, operating results and real estate investment trust distribution requirements, and may be adjusted at the discretion of the board of directors during the year.
at december 31, 2014, we had one series of preferred stock outstanding  series q. the annual dividend rate is 8.54% per share and dividends are payable quarterly in arrears.
pursuant to the terms of our preferred stock, we are restricted from declaring or paying any dividend with respect to our common stock unless and until all cumulative dividends with respect to the preferred stock have been paid and sufficient funds have been set aside for dividends that have been declared for the relevant dividend period with respect to the preferred stock.
other commitments on a continuing basis, we are engaged in various stages of negotiations for the acquisition and/or disposition of individual properties or portfolios of properties.
critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity's financial condition and results of operations and requires judgment on the part of management. generally, the judgment requires management to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. estimates are prepared using management's best judgment, after considering past and current economic conditions and expectations for the future. changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by stockholders, potential investors, industry analysts and lenders in their evaluation of our performance. of the accounting policies discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, those presented below have been identified by us as critical accounting policies.
consolidation we consolidate all entities that are wholly-owned and those in which we own less than 100% of the equity but control, as well as any variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary. we evaluate our ability to control an entity and whether the entity is a variable interest entity and we are the primary beneficiary through consideration of the substantive terms of the arrangement to identify which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impacts the entity's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity. investments in entities that we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are presented under the equity method. our ability to correctly assess our influence and/or control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in the consolidated financial statements.
business combinations upon acquisition of real estate that constitutes a business, which includes acquiring a controlling interest in an entity previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting, we allocate the purchase price to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component. the components typically include land, building, debt, intangible assets related to above and below market leases, value of costs to obtain tenants, deferred tax liability and other assumed assets and liabilities in the case of an acquisition of a business. in an acquisition of multiple properties, we must also allocate the purchase price among the properties. the allocation of the purchase price is based on our assessment of estimated fair value and often is based upon the expected future cash flows of the property and various characteristics of the markets where the property is located. the fair value may also include an enterprise value premium that we estimate a third party would be willing to pay for a portfolio of properties. in the case of an acquisition of a controlling interest in an entity previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting, this allocation may result in a gain or a loss. the initial allocation of the purchase price is based on management's preliminary assessment, which may differ when final information becomes available. subsequent adjustments made to the initial purchase price allocation are made within the allocation period, not to exceed one year.
capitalization of costs and depreciation we capitalize costs incurred in developing, renovating, rehabilitating and improving real estate assets as part of the investment basis. costs incurred in making repairs and maintaining real estate assets are expensed as incurred. during the land development and construction periods, we capitalize interest costs, insurance, real estate taxes and certain general and administrative costs of the personnel performing development, renovations and rehabilitation if such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use. capitalized costs are included in the investment basis of real estate assets.
35
we estimate the depreciable portion of our real estate assets and related useful lives in order to record depreciation expense. our ability to estimate the depreciable portions of our real estate assets and useful lives is critical to the determination of the appropriate amount of depreciation expense recorded and the carrying value of the underlying assets. any change to the assets to be depreciated and the estimated depreciable lives of these assets would have an impact on the depreciation expense recognized.
revenue recognition  gains on disposition of real estate and strategic capital income we recognize gains from the contributions and sales of real estate assets, generally at the time the title is transferred, consideration is received and we no longer have substantial continuing involvement with the real estate sold. in many of our transactions, an entity in which we have an equity investment will acquire a real estate asset from us. we make judgments based on the specific terms of each transaction as to the amount of the total profit from the transaction that we recognize given our continuing ownership interest and our level of future involvement with the entity that acquires the assets. in addition, we make judgments regarding recognition in earnings of certain fees and incentives earned for services provided to these entities based on when they are earned, fixed and determinable.
other than temporary impairment of investments in unconsolidated entities when circumstances indicate there may have been a reduction in the value of an equity investment, we evaluate whether the loss in value is other than temporary. if we determine there is a loss in value that is other than temporary, we recognize an impairment charge to reflect the investment at fair value. the use of projected future cash flows and other estimates of fair value, the determination of when a loss is other than temporary and the calculation of the amount of the loss is complex and subjective. use of other estimates and assumptions may result in different conclusions. changes in economic and operating conditions, as well as changes in our intent with regard to our investment that occur subsequent to our review, could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment charges of our equity investments.
derivative financial instruments derivatives instruments can be designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. accounting for derivatives as hedges requires that at inception, and over the term of the instruments, the hedged item and derivative qualify for hedge accounting. the rules and interpretations for derivatives are complex. failure to apply this guidance correctly may result in all changes in fair value of the derivative being recognized in earnings.
we assess both at inception, and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair values or cash flows of the related underlying exposures. any ineffective portion of a derivative financial instrument's change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings. derivatives not designated as hedges are to manage our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and variable interest rates but do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements.
see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our derivative financial instrument policy.
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, significant management judgment is required to estimate our income tax liability for each taxable entity, the liability associated with open tax years that are under review, our reit taxable income and our compliance with reit requirements. our estimates are based on interpretation of tax laws. we estimate our actual current income tax due and assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes resulting in the recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities. these estimates may have an impact on the income tax expense recognized. adjustments may be required by a change in assessment of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities; changes in assessments of the recognition of income tax benefits for certain non-routine transactions; changes due to audit adjustments by federal, international and state tax authorities; our inability to qualify as a reit; the potential for built-in gain recognition; changes in the assessment of properties to be contributed to taxable reit subsidiaries and changes in tax laws. adjustments required in any given period are included within income tax expense. we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is "more likely than not" that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities.
impairment of long-lived assets we assess the carrying values of our respective long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable.
recoverability of real estate assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. in order to review our real estate assets for recoverability, we consider current market conditions, as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. our intent with regard to the underlying assets might change as market conditions change. fair value is determined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, applying a capitalization rate to estimated noi of a property, quoted market values and third-party appraisals, where considered necessary. the use of projected future cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan we use to manage our underlying business. if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of a real estate property that we expect to hold is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the real estate property. at the time our intent changes to dispose of one of our real estate properties, we compare the carrying value of the property to the estimated proceeds from disposition. if there is an impairment, we record an impairment for any excess, including costs to sell.
36
assumptions and estimates used in the recoverability analyses for future cash flows, discount rates and capitalization rates are complex and subjective. changes in economic and operating conditions or our intent with regard to our investment that occurs subsequent to our impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment of our long-lived assets.
new accounting pronouncements see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
funds from operations ("ffo")
ffo is a financial measure that is not determined in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"), but is a measure that is commonly used in the real estate industry. the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo is net earnings. although the national association of real estate investment trusts ("nareit") has published a definition of ffo, modifications to the nareit calculation of ffo are common among real estate investment trusts, as companies seek to provide financial measures that meaningfully reflect their business.
ffo is not meant to represent a comprehensive system of financial reporting and does not present, nor do we intend it to present, a complete picture of our financial condition and operating performance. we believe net earnings computed under gaap remains the primary measure of performance and that ffo is only meaningful when it is used in conjunction with net earnings computed under gaap. further, we believe our consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with gaap, provide the most meaningful picture of our financial condition and our operating performance.
nareit's ffo measure adjusts net earnings computed under gaap to exclude historical cost depreciation and gains and losses from the sales, along with impairment charges, of previously depreciated properties. we agree that these nareit adjustments are useful to investors for the following reasons:
(i)                                             historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap assumes, through depreciation charges, that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. nareit stated in its white paper on ffo "since real estate asset values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves." consequently, nareit's definition of ffo reflects the fact that real estate, as an asset class, generally appreciates over time and depreciation charges required by gaap do not reflect the underlying economic realities.
(ii)                                          reits were created in order to encourage public ownership of real estate as an asset class through investment in firms that were in the business of long-term ownership and management of real estate. the exclusion, in nareit's definition of ffo, of gains and losses from the sales, along with impairment charges, of previously depreciated operating real estate assets allows investors and analysts to readily identify the operating results of the long-term assets that form the core of a reit's activity and assists in comparing those operating results between periods. we include the gains and losses (including impairment charges) from dispositions of land and development properties, as well as our proportionate share of the gains and losses (including impairment charges) from dispositions of development properties recognized by our unconsolidated entities, in our definition of ffo. we exclude the gain on revaluation of equity investments upon acquisition of a controlling interest from our definition of ffo.
our ffo measures at the same time that nareit created and defined its ffo measure for the reit industry, it also recognized that "management of each of its member companies has the responsibility and authority to publish financial information that it regards as useful to the financial community." we believe stockholders, potential investors and financial analysts who review our operating results are best served by a defined ffo measure that includes other adjustments to net earnings computed under gaap in addition to those included in the nareit-defined measure of ffo. our ffo measures are used by management in analyzing our business and the performance of our properties and we believe that it is important that stockholders, potential investors and financial analysts understand the measures management uses.
we use these ffo measures, including by segment and region, to: (i) evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison to expected results and results of previous periods, relative to resource allocation decisions; (ii) evaluate the performance of our management; (iii) budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources; (iv) assess our performance as compared to similar real estate companies and the industry in general; and (v) evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results. because we make decisions with regard to our performance with a long-term outlook, we believe it is appropriate to remove the effects of short-term items that we do not expect to affect the underlying long-term performance of the properties. the long-term performance of our properties is principally driven by rental income. while not infrequent or unusual, these additional items we exclude in calculating ffo, as defined by prologis, defined below, are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period that cause both positive and negative short-term effects on our results of operations in inconsistent and unpredictable directions that are not relevant to our long-term outlook.
we use our ffo measures as supplemental financial measures of operating performance. we do not use our ffo measures as, nor should they be considered to be, alternatives to net earnings computed under gaap, as indicators of our operating performance, as alternatives to cash from operating activities computed under gaap or as indicators of our ability to fund our cash needs.
37
ffo, as defined by prologis to arrive at ffo, as defined by prologis, we adjust the nareit-defined ffo measure to exclude:
(i)   deferred income tax benefits and deferred income tax expenses recognized by our subsidiaries;
(ii)   current income tax expense related to acquired tax liabilities that were recorded as deferred tax liabilities in an acquisition, to the extent the expense is offset with a deferred income tax benefit in gaap earnings that is excluded from our defined ffo measure;
(iii)   unhedged foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from debt transactions between us and our foreign consolidated subsidiaries and our foreign unconsolidated entities;
(iv)   foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement (based on current foreign currency exchange rates) of certain third-party debt of our foreign consolidated subsidiaries and our foreign unconsolidated entities; and
(v)   mark-to-market adjustments and related amortization of debt discounts associated with derivative financial instruments.
we calculate ffo, as defined by prologis for our unconsolidated entities on the same basis as we calculate our ffo, as defined by prologis.
we believe investors are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of our operating results along the same lines that our management uses in planning and executing our business strategy.
core ffo in addition to ffo, as defined by prologis, we also use core ffo. to arrive at core ffo, we adjust ffo, as defined by prologis, to exclude the following recurring and non-recurring items that we recognized directly or our share of these items recognized by our unconsolidated entities to the extent they are included in ffo, as defined by prologis:
(i)   gains or losses from contribution or sale of land or development properties;
(ii)   income tax expense related to the sale of investments in real estate and third-party acquisition costs related to the acquisition of real estate;
(iii)   impairment charges recognized related to our investments in real estate generally as a result of our change in intent to contribute or sell these properties;
(iv)   gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt and redemption and repurchase of preferred stock;
(v)   merger, acquisition and other integration expenses; and
(vi)   expenses related to natural disasters.
we believe it is appropriate to further adjust our ffo, as defined by prologis for certain recurring items as they were driven by transactional activity and factors relating to the financial and real estate markets, rather than factors specific to the on-going operating performance of our properties or investments. the impairment charges we have recognized were primarily based on valuations of real estate, which had declined due to market conditions, that we no longer expected to hold for long-term investment. over the last few years, we made it a priority to strengthen our financial position by reducing our debt, our investment in certain low yielding assets and our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations. as a result, we changed our intent to sell or contribute certain of our real estate properties and recorded impairment charges when we did not expect to recover the costs of our investment. also, we purchased portions of our debt securities when we believed it was advantageous to do so, which was based on market conditions, and in an effort to lower our borrowing costs and extend our debt maturities. as a result, we have recognized net gains or losses on the early extinguishment of certain debt due to the financial market conditions at that time.
we have also adjusted for some non-recurring items. the merger, acquisition and other integration expenses included costs we incurred in 2012 associated with the merger between amb and prologis, the acquisition of prologis european properties and the integration of our systems and processes. in addition, we and our co-investment ventures make acquisitions of real estate and we believe the costs associated with these transactions are transaction based and not part of our core operations.
we analyze our operating performance primarily by the rental income of our real estate and the revenue driven by our strategic capital business, net of operating, administrative and financing expenses. this income stream is not directly impacted by fluctuations in the market value of our investments in real estate or debt securities. although these items discussed above have had a material impact on our operations and are reflected in our financial statements, the removal of the effects of these items allows us to better understand the core operating performance of our properties over the long term.
we use core ffo, including by segment and region, to: (i) evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison to expected results and results of previous periods, relative to resource allocation decisions; (ii) evaluate the performance of our management; (iii) budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources; (iv) provide guidance to the financial markets to understand our
38
expected operating performance; (v) assess our operating performance as compared to similar real estate companies and the industry in general; and (vi) evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results. because we make decisions with regard to our performance with a long-term outlook, we believe it is appropriate to remove the effects of items that we do not expect to affect the underlying long-term performance of the properties we own. as noted above, we believe the long-term performance of our properties is principally driven by rental income. we believe investors are best served if the information that is made available to them allows them to align their analysis and evaluation of our operating results along the same lines that our management uses in planning and executing our business strategy.
limitations on use of our ffo measures while we believe our defined ffo measures are important supplemental measures, neither nareit's nor our measures of ffo should be used alone because they exclude significant economic components of net earnings computed under gaap and are, therefore, limited as an analytical tool. accordingly, these are only a few of the many measures we use when analyzing our business. some of these limitations are:
(i)   the current income tax expenses and acquisition costs that are excluded from our defined ffo measures represent the taxes and transaction costs that are payable.
(ii)                                  depreciation and amortization of real estate assets are economic costs that are excluded from ffo. ffo is limited, as it does not reflect the cash requirements that may be necessary for future replacements of the real estate assets. further, the amortization of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of industrial properties are not reflected in ffo.
(iii)   gains or losses from property acquisitions and dispositions or impairment charges related to expected dispositions represent changes in value of the properties. by excluding these gains and losses, ffo does not capture realized changes in the value of acquired or disposed properties arising from changes in market conditions.
(iv)   the deferred income tax benefits and expenses that are excluded from our defined ffo measures result from the creation of a deferred income tax asset or liability that may have to be settled at some future point. our defined ffo measures do not currently reflect any income or expense that may result from such settlement.
(v)                                          the foreign currency exchange gains and losses that are excluded from our defined ffo measures are generally recognized based on movements in foreign currency exchange rates through a specific point in time. the ultimate settlement of our foreign currency-denominated net assets is indefinite as to timing and amount. our ffo measures are limited in that they do not reflect the current period changes in these net assets that result from periodic foreign currency exchange rate movements.
(vi)   the gains and losses on extinguishment of debt that we exclude from our core ffo, may provide a benefit or cost to us as we may be settling our debt at less or more than our future obligation.
(vii)   the merger, acquisition and other integration expenses and the natural disaster expenses that we exclude from core ffo are costs that we have incurred.
39
we compensate for these limitations by using our ffo measures only in conjunction with net earnings computed under gaap when making our decisions. this information should be read with our complete consolidated financial statements prepared under gaap. to assist investors in compensating for these limitations, we reconcile our defined ffo measures to our net earnings computed under gaap for the years ended december 31 as follows (in thousands).

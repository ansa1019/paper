item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations please read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
we have omitted discussion of 2017 results where it would be redundant to the discussion previously included in part ii, item 7 of our 2018 annual report on form 10-k, as amended.
trends in our business the following trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate that they will continue to affect our future results:
•users' behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves.
the continuing shift from an offline to online world has contributed to the growth of our business since inception, contributing to revenue growth, and we expect that this online shift will continue to benefit our business.
•users are increasingly using diverse devices and modalities to access our products and services, and our advertising revenues are increasingly coming from new formats.
our users are accessing the internet via diverse devices and modalities, such as smartphones, wearables and smart home devices, and want to feel connected no matter where they are or what they are doing. we seek to expand our products and services to stay in front of these trends in order to maintain and grow our business.
we generate our advertising revenues increasingly from different channels, including mobile, and newer advertising formats, and the margins from the advertising revenues from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional desktop search. additionally, as the market for a particular device type or modality matures our revenues may be affected. for example, growth in the global smartphone market has slowed due to various factors, including increased market saturation in developed countries, which can affect our mobile advertising revenue growth rates.
we expect tac paid to our distribution partners to increase as our revenues grow and to be affected by changes in device mix; geographic mix; partner mix; partner agreement terms; and the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points.
we expect these trends to continue to put pressure on our overall margins and affect our revenue growth rates.
•as online advertising evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings which may affect our monetization.
as interactions between users and advertisers change and as online user behavior evolves, we continue to expand and evolve our product offerings to serve their changing needs. over time, we expect our monetization trends to fluctuate. for example, we have seen an increase in youtube engagement ads, which monetize at a lower rate than traditional search ads.
•as users in developing economies increasingly come online, our revenues from international markets continue to increase and movements in foreign exchange rates affect such revenues.
the shift to online, as well as the advent of the multi-device world, has brought opportunities outside of the u.s., including in emerging markets, and we continue to develop localized versions of our products and relevant advertising programs useful to our users in these markets. this has led to a trend of increased revenues from international markets over time and we expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these markets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available. this trend could impact our margins as developing markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets.
our international revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the u.s. dollar. while we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings.
alphabet inc.
•the portion of our revenues that we derive from non-advertising revenues is increasing and may affect margins.
non-advertising revenues have grown over time. we expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our offerings to our users through products and services like google cloud, google play, hardware products, and youtube subscriptions. across these initiatives, we currently derive non-advertising revenues primarily from sales of apps, in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees, including fees received for google cloud offerings and subscription and other services. the margins on these revenues vary significantly and may be lower than the margins on our advertising revenues. a number of our other bets initiatives are in their initial development stages, and as such, the sources of revenues from these businesses could change over time and the revenues could be volatile.
•as we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and capital expenditures.
we continue to make significant r&d investments in areas of strategic focus such as advertising, cloud, machine learning, and search, as well as in new products and services. in addition, our capital expenditures have grown over the last several years. we expect this trend to continue in the long term as we invest heavily in land and buildings for data centers and offices, and information technology infrastructure, which includes servers and network equipment.
in addition, acquisitions remain an important part of our strategy and use of capital, and we expect to continue to spend cash on acquisitions and other investments. these acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of our offerings, as well as expand our expertise in engineering and other functional areas.
•   our employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them.
our employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. we expect to continue hiring talented employees around the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs to our employees.

google advertising revenues our advertising revenue growth, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on google properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on google network members' properties and the correlation between these items, have been affected and may continue to be affected by various factors, including:
•   advertiser competition for keywords;
•   changes in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy;
•   changes in device mix;
•   changes in foreign currency exchange rates;
•   fees advertisers are willing to pay based on how they manage their advertising costs;
•   general economic conditions;
•   seasonality; and
•   traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various advertising verticals and channels.
our advertising revenue growth rate has been affected over time as a result of a number of factors, including challenges in maintaining our growth rate as revenues increase to higher levels; changes in our product mix; changes in advertising quality or formats and delivery; the evolution of the online advertising market; increasing competition; our investments in new business strategies; query growth rates; and shifts in the geographic mix of our revenues. we also expect that our revenue growth rate will continue to be affected by evolving user preferences, the acceptance by users of our products and services as they are delivered on diverse devices and modalities, our ability to create a seamless experience for both users and advertisers, and movements in foreign currency exchange rates.

(1)    youtube non-advertising revenues are included in google other revenues.
google advertising revenues are generated on our google properties (including google search & other properties and youtube) and google network members' properties. google advertising revenues consist primarily of the following:
•   google search &amp; other consists of revenues generated on google search properties (including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.) and other google owned and operated properties like gmail, google maps, and google play;
•   youtube ads consists of revenues generated primarily on youtube properties; and
•   google network members' properties consist of revenues generated primarily on google network members' properties participating in admob, adsense, and google ad manager.
google search & other our google search & other revenues increased $12,819 million from 2018 to 2019. the growth was primarily driven by interrelated factors including increases in search queries resulting from ongoing growth in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices, continued growth in advertiser activity, and improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery. revenue growth was partially offset by the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.
our google search & other revenues increased $15,485 million from 2017 to 2018. the growth was primarily driven by increases in mobile search resulting from ongoing growth in user adoption and usage, as well as continued growth in advertiser activity. growth was also driven by improvements in ad formats and delivery, primarily on desktop. additionally, revenue growth was favorably affected by the general weakening of the u.s. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.
youtube ads youtube ads revenues increased $3,994 million from 2018 to 2019 and increased $3,005 million from 2017 to 2018. the largest contributors to the growth during both periods were our direct response and brand advertising products, both of which benefited from improvements to ad formats and delivery and increased advertiser spending.
google network members' properties our google network members' properties revenues increased $1,537 million from 2018 to 2019. the growth was primarily driven by strength in both admanager (included in what was previously referred to as programmatic advertising buying) and admob, partially offset by the general strengthening of the u.s. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.
our google network members' properties revenues increased $2,394 million from 2017 to 2018, primarily driven by strength in both admob and admanager, offset by a decline in our traditional adsense businesses. additionally, the growth was favorably affected by the general weakening of the u.s. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.
use of monetization metrics paid clicks for our google properties represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users related to searches on google.com and other owned and operated properties including gmail, google maps, and google play; and viewed youtube engagement ads (certain youtube ad formats are not included in our click or impression based metrics). impressions for our google network members' properties include impressions displayed to users served on google network members' properties participating primarily in admob, adsense and google ad manager.
cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.
alphabet inc.
cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based revenues divided by our total number of impressions and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each impression displayed to users.
as our business evolves, we periodically review, refine and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks on our google properties and the number of impressions on google network members' properties and for identifying the revenues generated by click activity on our google properties and the revenues generated by impression activity on google network members' properties.

cost-per-click change    (25   )%              (7   )%
the number of paid clicks through our advertising programs on google properties increased from 2018 to 2019 due to growth in views of youtube engagement ads; increase in clicks due to interrelated factors, including an increase in search queries resulting from ongoing growth in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices; continued growth in advertiser activity; and improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery. the positive effect on our revenues from an increase in paid clicks was partially offset by a decrease in the cost-per-click paid by our advertisers. the decrease in cost-per-click was primarily driven by continued growth in youtube engagement ads where cost-per-click remains lower than on our other advertising platforms. cost-per-click was also affected by changes in device mix, geographic mix, ongoing product changes, product mix, property mix, and fluctuations of the u.s. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.

use of constant currency revenues and constant currency revenue growth the effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons. our international revenues are favorably affected as the u.s. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies, and unfavorably affected as the u.s. dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. our revenues are also favorably affected by net hedging gains and unfavorably affected by net hedging losses.
we use non-gaap constant currency revenues and constant currency revenue growth for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) results helps improve alphabet inc.
the ability to understand our performance because they exclude the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.
constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. we define constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, and use it to determine the constant currency revenue growth on a year-on-year basis. constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.
constant currency revenue growth (expressed as a percentage) is calculated by determining the increase in current period revenues over prior period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods.
these results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with gaap. results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with gaap.

costs and expenses cost of revenues cost of revenues consists of tac which are paid to google network members primarily for ads displayed on their properties and amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers.
the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on google network members' properties are significantly higher than the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on google properties because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on google network members' properties are paid as tac to our google network members.
additionally, other cost of revenues (which is the cost of revenues excluding tac) includes the following:
•   content acquisition costs primarily related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution on youtube advertising and subscription services and google play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee);
•   expenses associated with our data centers and other operations (including bandwidth, compensation expenses (including stock-based compensation (sbc)), depreciation, energy, and other equipment costs); and
•   inventory related costs for hardware we sell.
the following tables present our cost of revenues, including tac (in millions):

total cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues        43.5     %              44.4     %
cost of revenues increased $12,347 million from 2018 to 2019. the increase was due to increases in other cost of revenues and tac of $8,984 million and $3,363 million, respectively.
the increase in other cost of revenues from 2018 to 2019 was due to an increase in data center and other operations costs. additionally, there was an increase in content acquisition costs for youtube consistent with the growth in youtube revenues.
the increase in tac from 2018 to 2019 was due to increases in tac paid to distribution partners and to google network members, primarily driven by growth in revenues subject to tac. the tac rate decreased from 22.9% to 22.3%, primarily due to the favorable revenue mix shift from google network members' properties to google properties. the tac rate on google properties revenues increased primarily due to the ongoing shift to mobile, which carries higher tac because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points. the tac rate on google network revenues decreased primarily due to changes in product mix to products that carry a lower tac rate.
over time, cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues may be affected by a number of factors, including the following:
•   the amount of tac paid to google network members, which is affected by a combination of factors such as geographic mix, product mix, revenue share terms, and fluctuations of the u.s. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies;
•   the amount of tac paid to distribution partners, which is affected by changes in device mix, geographic mix, partner mix, partner agreement terms such as revenue share arrangements, and the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points;
•   relative revenue growth rates of google properties and google network members' properties;
•   costs associated with our data centers and other operations to support ads, google cloud, search, youtube and other products;
•   content acquisition costs, which are primarily affected by the relative growth rates in our youtube advertising and subscription revenues;
•   costs related to hardware sales; and
•   increased proportion of non-advertising revenues, which generally have higher costs of revenues, relative to our advertising revenues.

other income (expense), net, as a percentage of revenues         5.4     %               3.3     %
other income (expense), net, decreased $1,995 million from 2018 to 2019. this decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in gains on equity securities, which were $2,649 million in 2019 as compared to $5,460 million in 2018. the majority of the gains in both periods were unrealized. the effect of the decrease in gains on equity securities was partially offset by a decrease in performance fees. the decrease in other income (expense) was also driven by a decrease in gains on debt securities primarily due to an unrealized gain recognized in 2018 resulting from the modification of the terms of a non-marketable debt security.
performance fees of $1,203 million have been reclassified from general and administrative expenses to other income (expense), net, for 2018 to conform with current period presentation. see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further details.
over time, other income (expense), net, as a percentage of revenues may be affected by market dynamics and other factors. equity values generally change daily for marketable equity securities and upon the occurrence of observable price changes or upon impairment of non-marketable equity securities. in addition, volatility in the global economic climate and financial markets could result in a significant change in the value of our equity securities. fluctuations in the value of these investments has, and we expect will continue to, contribute to volatility of oi&e in future periods. for additional information about equity investments, see note 1 and note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.

effective tax rate                12.0     %              13.3     %
our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate increased from 2018 to 2019, due to discrete events in 2018 and 2019. in 2018, we released our deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to gains on equity securities and recognized the benefits of the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act ("tax act"). in 2019, we recognized an increase in discrete benefits related to the resolution of multi-year audits, partially offset by the reversal of altera tax benefit as a result of the u.s. court of appeals decision. see note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information.
as of december 31, 2019, we have simplified our corporate legal entity structure and now license intellectual property from the u.s. that was previously licensed from bermuda. this will affect our geographic mix of earnings.
we expect our future effective tax rate to be affected by the geographic mix of earnings in countries with different statutory rates. additionally, our future effective tax rate may be affected by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items.

quarterly results of operations the following tables presenting our quarterly results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. we have prepared the unaudited information on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements. our operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future quarters or for a full year.
the following table presents our unaudited quarterly results of operations for the eight quarters ended december 31, 2019. this table includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated financial position and operating results for the quarters presented. seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and advertiser expenditures, underlying business trends such as traditional retail seasonality and macroeconomic conditions have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our business. commercial queries typically increase significantly in the fourth quarter of each year. these seasonal trends have caused, and will likely continue to cause, fluctuations in our quarterly results, including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates.

capital resources and liquidity as of december 31, 2019, we had $119.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market funds, highly liquid government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities and marketable equity securities.
as of december 31, 2019, we had long-term taxes payable of $7.3 billion related to a one-time transition tax payable incurred as a result of the tax act. as permitted by the tax act, we will pay the transition tax in annual interest-free installments through 2025.
in 2017, 2018 and 2019, the ec announced decisions that certain actions taken by google infringed european competition law and imposed fines of €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of june 27, 2017), €4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of june 30, 2018), and €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of march 20, 2019), respectively. while each ec decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines.

in november 2019, we entered into an agreement to acquire fitbit, a leading wearables brand, for $7.35 per share, representing a total purchase price of approximately $2.1 billion as of the date of the agreement. the acquisition of fitbit is expected to be completed in 2020, subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals.
our principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from our operations. the primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long term growth of the business. we regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace and form of capital return to stockholders.
we have a short-term debt financing program of up to $5.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. we had no commercial paper outstanding as of december 31, 2019. we have $4.0 billion of revolving credit facilities expiring in july 2023 with no amounts outstanding as of december 31, 2019. the interest rate for the credit facilities is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. we believe that our sources of funding will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements including capital expenditures, working capital requirements, potential acquisitions and other liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months.

net cash used in financing activities       $(13,179      )           $(23,209      )
cash provided by operating activities our largest source of cash provided by our operations are advertising revenues generated by google properties and google network members' properties. additionally, we generate cash through sales of apps, in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees, including fees received for google cloud offerings and subscription-based products.
our primary uses of cash from our operating activities include payments to our google network members and distribution partners, and payments for content acquisition costs. in addition, uses of cash from operating activities include compensation and related costs, hardware inventory costs, other general corporate expenditures, and income taxes.
net cash provided by operating activities increased from 2018 to 2019 primarily due to increases in cash received from revenues, offset by increases in cash paid for cost of revenues and operating expenses.
cash used in investing activities cash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of our investments in marketable and non-marketable securities. cash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of property and alphabet inc.
equipment, which primarily includes our investments in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology infrastructure to provide capacity for the growth of our businesses; purchases of marketable and non-marketable securities; and payments for acquisitions.
net cash used in investing activities increased from 2018 to 2019 primarily due to a net increase in purchases of securities and an increase in payments for acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in payments for purchases of property and equipment. the decrease in purchases of property and equipment was driven by decreases in purchases of servers as well as land and buildings for offices, partially offset by an increase in data center construction.
cash used in financing activities cash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from sale of interest in consolidated entities. cash used in financing activities consists primarily of net payments related to stock-based award activities, repurchases of capital stock, and repayments of debt.
net cash used in financing activities increased from 2018 to 2019 primarily due to an increase in cash payments for repurchases of capital stock and a decrease in proceeds from sale of interest in consolidated entities.

critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap. in doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, gains and losses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. in some cases, we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates. in some cases, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations will be affected. we base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. we refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss further below. we have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors.
please see notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for a summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements.
revenues for the sale of third-party goods and services, we evaluate whether we are the principal, and report revenues on a gross basis, or an agent, and report revenues on a net basis. in this assessment, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in establishing price.
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made.
the provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties. in addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue services (irs) and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
loss contingencies we are regularly subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings involving competition and antitrust, intellectual property, privacy, consumer protection, non-income taxes, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, and other matters. certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. we record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. if we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
we evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our disclosures as appropriate. significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being, and the estimated amount of, a loss related to such matters. until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
long-lived assets long-lived assets, including property and equipment, long-term prepayments, and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated alphabet inc.
from the assets are less than their carrying amount. measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value.
fair value measurements we measure certain of our non-marketable equity and debt investments, certain other instruments including stock-based compensation awards settled in the stock of certain other bets, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. the determination of fair value involves the use of appropriate valuation methods and relevant inputs into valuation models. the fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value whereby it gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. we maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. our use of unobservable inputs reflects the assumptions that market participants would use and may include our own data adjusted based on reasonably available information. we apply judgment in assessing the relevance of observable market data to determine the priority of inputs under the fair value hierarchy, particularly in situations where there is very little or no market activity.
in determining the fair values of our non-marketable equity and debt investments, as well as assets acquired (especially with respect to intangible assets) and liabilities assumed in business combinations, we make significant estimates and assumptions, some of which include the use of unobservable inputs.
certain stock-based compensation awards may be settled in the stock of certain of our other bets or in cash. these awards are based on the equity values of the respective other bet, which requires use of unobservable inputs.
we also have compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized investment returns, i.e. performance fees. we recognize compensation expense based on the estimated payouts, which may result in expense recognized before investment returns are realized, and may require the use of unobservable inputs.
non-marketable equity securities our non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are carried either at fair value or under the measurement alternative. under the measurement alternative, the carrying value is measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. determining whether an observed transaction is similar to a security within our portfolio requires judgment based on the rights and obligations of the securities. recording upward and downward adjustments to the carrying value of our equity securities as a result of observable price changes requires quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities using various valuation methodologies and involves the use of estimates.
non-marketable equity securities are also subject to periodic impairment reviews. our quarterly impairment analysis considers both qualitative and quantitative factors that may have a significant effect on the investment's fair value. qualitative factors considered include industry and market conditions, financial performance, business prospects, and other relevant events and factors. when indicators of impairment exist, we prepare quantitative assessments of the fair value of our equity investments using both the market and income approaches which require judgment and the use of estimates, including discount rates, investee revenues and costs, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among others. when our assessment indicates that an impairment exists, we measure our non-marketable securities at fair value.

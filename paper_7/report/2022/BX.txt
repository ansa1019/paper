in this report, references to "blackstone," the "company," "we," "us" or "our" refer to blackstone inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
our business blackstone is one of the world's leading investment firms. our business is organized into four segments: real estate, private equity, credit & insurance and hedge fund solutions. for more information about our business segments, see "part i. item 1. business - business segments."
we generate revenue from fees earned pursuant to contractual arrangements with funds, fund investors and fund portfolio companies (including management, transaction and monitoring fees), and from capital markets services. we also invest in the vehicles we manage and we are entitled to a pro-rata share of the results of the vehicle (a "pro-rata allocation"). in addition to a pro-rata allocation, and assuming certain investment returns are achieved, we are entitled to a disproportionate allocation of the income otherwise allocable to the investors ("performance allocations"). in carry funds, such allocations are commonly referred to as carried interest. in certain structures, we receive a contractual incentive fee from an investment vehicle in the event that specified cumulative investment returns are achieved (an "incentive fee," and together with performance allocations, "performance revenues"). the composition of our revenues will vary based on market conditions and the cyclicality of the different businesses in which we operate. net investment gains and investment income generated by the blackstone funds are driven by value created by our operating and strategic initiatives as well as overall market conditions. fair values are affected by changes in the fundamentals of our portfolio company and other investments, the industries in which they operate, the overall economy and other market conditions.
business environment blackstone's businesses are materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions in the u.s., europe, asia and, to a lesser extent, elsewhere in the world.
in 2022, the market environment was one of the most challenging since the global financial crisis as central banks around the world pursued monetary policy tightening amid high, persistent inflation. in the u.s., annual inflation reached 9.1% in june 2022 but subsequently declined to 6.5% in december 2022. in eurozone economies, inflation reached 10.6% in october 2022 before decreasing to 9.2% in december 2022. the u.s. federal reserve raised the federal funds target range seven times over the course of 2022, beginning the year at 0.0%-0.25% and reaching 4.25%-4.50% in december. in february 2023, the federal reserve further raised the federal funds target range to 4.50%-4.75% and reiterated its anticipation that ongoing increases would be appropriate in order to return to the u.s. federal reserve's long term inflation target of 2%. economists expect inflation to continue moderating from 2022 highs, but remain above the u.s. federal reserve's long run target of 2% for a period of time.
despite monetary policy tightening, economic growth, employment rates and consumer health indicators have demonstrated resilience. the bureau of economic analysis' advance estimate of u.s. real gdp growth indicated growth of 2.1% in 2022, down from 5.9% in 2021. the u.s. unemployment rate remained at the pre-pandemic level of 3.5% in december 2022, down from 3.9% in december 2021, indicating a robust labor market. retail sales increased 9.2% year-over-year in 2022, driven in part by higher prices. in manufacturing, however, the institute for supply management purchasing managers' index decreased to 48.4 in december 2022, down from 58.8 in december 2021, signaling a contraction in the u.s. manufacturing sector for the first time since may 2020. while the u.s. economy demonstrated relative strength, other major economies experienced less robust fundamentals. in china, there was 0% economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2022 and 3% for the year - the second lowest level since 1976. most economists believe an economic recession in 2023 is highly probable in the u.k., but somewhat less probable in the eurozone.
87
the s&p 500 declined 18% in 2022 with most sectors down for the year. the telecom sector experienced the largest decline, down 40%, while energy was the best performing sector, up 65%. the price of west texas intermediate crude oil increased 7% in 2022 to $80 per barrel, and remained at approximately that same level in february 2023. the henry hub natural gas spot price increased 20% to $4.48 during the year, but has subsequently fallen to $2.57 as of february 14, 2023.
volatility increased materially as the cboe volatility index rose 26% in 2022. capital markets and transaction activity declined materially, with u.s. initial public offering volumes down 93% and u.s. announced merger and acquisition deal volumes down 43% compared to 2021.
the ten-year treasury yield increased by 273 basis points to a fourteen-year high of 4.24% in october 2022 and ended the year lower at 3.87%. since year end, the rate has risen slightly to 3.92% as of february 22, 2023. meanwhile, short term rates remain on an upward trajectory as three-month libor increased by 4.56% to 4.82% during 2022 and has since increased to 4.93% as of february 22, 2023.
in credit markets, the s&p leveraged loan index decreased by 0.6% and the credit suisse high yield bond index declined by 11% in 2022. high yield spreads widened by 144 basis points in 2022, while issuance decreased 77%.
while showing some recent signs of moderating in the u.s., inflation remains meaningfully elevated. in response, the federal reserve has indicated that it anticipates further interest rate increases will be appropriate in order to achieve inflation at the rate of two percent over the longer term. the economic consensus predicts multiple additional moderate interest rate increases in the remainder of 2023, with some economists predicting a first reduction by the end of 2023. the possibility of a period of economic slowdown or recession has contributed, and in the near term may continue to contribute, to market volatility.

the simplified diagram below depicts our current organizational structure. the diagram does not depict all of our subsidiaries, including intermediate holding companies through which certain of the subsidiaries depicted are held.
key financial measures and indicators we manage our business using certain financial measures and key operating metrics since we believe these metrics measure the productivity of our investment activities. we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap"). see "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - note 2. summary of significant accounting policies" and "- critical accounting policies." our key non-gaap financial measures and operating indicators and metrics are discussed below.
distributable earnings distributable earnings is derived from blackstone's segment reported results. distributable earnings is used to assess performance and amounts available for dividends to blackstone stockholders, including blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of the blackstone holdings partnerships. distributable earnings is the sum of segment distributable earnings plus net interest and dividend income (loss) less taxes and related payables. distributable earnings excludes unrealized activity and is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable gaap measure of income (loss) before provision (benefit) for taxes. see "- non-gaap financial measures" for our reconciliation of distributable earnings.
89
net interest and dividend income (loss) is presented on a segment basis and is equal to interest and dividend revenue less interest expense, adjusted for the impact of consolidation of blackstone funds, and interest expense associated with the tax receivable agreement.
taxes and related payables represent the total gaap tax provision adjusted to include only the current tax provision (benefit) calculated on income (loss) before provision (benefit) for taxes and including the payable under the tax receivable agreement. further, the current tax provision utilized when calculating taxes and related payables and distributable earnings reflects the benefit of deductions available to the company on certain expense items that are excluded from the underlying calculation of segment distributable earnings and total segment distributable earnings, such as equity-based compensation charges and certain transaction-related charges where there is a current tax provision or benefit. the economic assumptions and methodologies that impact the implied income tax provision are the same as those methodologies and assumptions used in calculating the current income tax provision for blackstone's consolidated statements of operations under gaap, excluding the impact of divestitures and accrued tax contingencies and refunds which are reflected when paid or received. management believes that including the amount payable under the tax receivable agreement and utilizing the current income tax provision adjusted as described above when calculating distributable earnings is meaningful as it increases comparability between periods and more accurately reflects earnings that are available for distribution to stockholders.
segment distributable earnings segment distributable earnings is blackstone's segment profitability measure used to make operating decisions and assess performance across blackstone's four segments. blackstone believes it is useful to stockholders to review the measure that management uses in assessing segment performance. segment distributable earnings represents the net realized earnings of blackstone's segments and is the sum of fee related earnings and net realizations for each segment. blackstone's segments are presented on a basis that deconsolidates blackstone funds, eliminates non-controlling ownership interests in blackstone's consolidated operating partnerships, removes the amortization of intangible assets and removes transaction-related charges. transaction-related charges arise from corporate actions including acquisitions, divestitures and blackstone's initial public offering. they consist primarily of equity-based compensation charges, gains and losses on contingent consideration arrangements, changes in the balance of the tax receivable agreement resulting from a change in tax law or similar event, transaction costs and any gains or losses associated with these corporate actions. segment distributable earnings excludes unrealized activity and is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable gaap measure of income (loss) before provision (benefit) for taxes. see "- non-gaap financial measures" for our reconciliation of segment distributable earnings.
net realizations is presented on a segment basis and is the sum of realized principal investment income and realized performance revenues (which refers to realized performance revenues excluding fee related performance revenues), less realized performance compensation (which refers to realized performance compensation excluding fee related performance compensation and equity-based performance compensation).
realized performance compensation reflects an increase in the aggregate realized performance compensation paid to certain of our professionals above the amounts allocable to them based upon the percentage participation in the relevant performance plans previously awarded to them as a result of a compensation program that commenced during the three months ended june 30, 2021. for the full year 2022, fee related compensation was decreased by the total amount of additional performance compensation awarded for the year. during the year ended december 31, 2022, realized performance compensation was increased by an aggregate of $77.0 million and fee related compensation was decreased by a corresponding amount. in the year ended december 31, 2021, realized performance compensation was increased by an aggregate of $19.7 million and fee related compensation was decreased by a corresponding amount. these changes to realized performance compensation and fee related compensation reduced net realizations, increased fee related
90
earnings and had a neutral impact to income before provision (benefit) for taxes and distributable earnings in the years ended december 31, 2022 and december 31, 2021.
fee related earnings fee related earnings is a performance measure used to assess blackstone's ability to generate profits from revenues that are measured and received on a recurring basis and not subject to future realization events. blackstone believes fee related earnings is useful to stockholders as it provides insight into the profitability of the portion of blackstone's business that is not dependent on realization activity. fee related earnings equals management and advisory fees (net of management fee reductions and offsets) plus fee related performance revenues, less (a) fee related compensation on a segment basis, and (b) other operating expenses. fee related earnings is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable gaap measure of income (loss) before provision (benefit) for taxes. see "- non-gaap financial measures" for our reconciliation of fee related earnings.
fee related compensation is presented on a segment basis and refers to the compensation expense, excluding equity-based compensation, directly related to (a) management and advisory fees, net and (b) fee related performance revenues, referred to as fee related performance compensation.
fee related performance revenues refers to the realized portion of performance revenues from perpetual capital that are (a) measured and received on a recurring basis, and (b) not dependent on realization events from the underlying investments.
other operating expenses is presented on a segment basis and is equal to general, administrative and other expenses, adjusted to (a) remove the amortization of transaction-related intangibles, (b) remove certain expenses reimbursed by the blackstone funds which are netted against management and advisory fees, net in blackstone's segment presentation, and (c) give effect to an administrative fee collected on a quarterly basis from certain holders of blackstone holdings partnership units. the administrative fee is accounted for as a capital contribution under gaap, but is reflected as a reduction of other operating expenses in blackstone's segment presentation.
adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization ("adjusted ebitda"), is a supplemental measure used to assess performance derived from blackstone's segment results and may be used to assess its ability to service its borrowings. adjusted ebitda represents distributable earnings plus the addition of (a) interest expense on a segment basis, (b) taxes and related payables, and (c) depreciation and amortization. adjusted ebitda is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable gaap measure of income (loss) before provision (benefit) for taxes. see "- non-gaap financial measures" for our reconciliation of adjusted ebitda.
net accrued performance revenues net accrued performance revenues is a non-gaap financial measure blackstone believes is useful to stockholders as an indicator of potential future realized performance revenues based on the current investment portfolio of the funds and vehicles we manage. net accrued performance revenues represents the accrued performance revenues receivable by blackstone, net of the related accrued performance compensation payable by blackstone, excluding performance revenues that have been realized but not yet distributed as of the reporting date and clawback amounts, if any. net accrued performance revenues is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable gaap measure of investments. see "- non-gaap financial measures" for our reconciliation of net accrued performance revenues and note 2 "summary of significant accounting policies - equity method investments" in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" in "- item 8.

operating metrics the alternative asset management business is primarily based on managing third party capital and does not require substantial capital investment to support rapid growth. since our inception, we have developed and used various key operating metrics to assess and monitor the operating performance of our various alternative asset management businesses in order to monitor the effectiveness of our value creating strategies.
total and fee-earning assets under management total assets under management refers to the assets we manage. we believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it represents the total capital for which we provide investment management services. our total assets under management equals the sum of:
(a)   the fair value of the investments held by our carry funds and our side-by-side and co-investment entities managed by us plus the capital that we are entitled to call from investors in those funds and entities pursuant to the terms of their respective capital commitments, including capital commitments to funds that have yet to commence their investment periods,
(b)   the net asset value of (1) our hedge funds, real estate debt carry funds, bpp, certain co-investments managed by us, certain credit-focused funds, and our hedge fund solutions drawdown funds (plus, in each case, the capital that we are entitled to call from investors in those funds, including commitments yet to commence their investment periods), and (2) our funds of hedge funds, our hedge fund solutions registered investment companies, breit, and bepif,
(c)   the invested capital, fair value or net asset value of assets we manage pursuant to separately managed accounts,
(d)   the amount of debt and equity outstanding for our clos during the reinvestment period,
(e)   the aggregate par amount of collateral assets, including principal cash, for our clos after the reinvestment period,
(f)   the gross or net amount of assets (including leverage where applicable) for our credit-focused registered investment companies,
(g)   the fair value of common stock, preferred stock, convertible debt, term loans or similar instruments issued by bxmt, and
(h)   borrowings under and any amounts available to be borrowed under certain credit facilities of our funds.
our carry funds are commitment-based drawdown structured funds that do not permit investors to redeem their interests at their election. our funds of hedge funds, hedge funds, funds structured like hedge funds and other open-ended funds in our real estate, credit & insurance and hedge fund solutions segments generally have structures that afford an investor the right to withdraw or redeem their interests on a periodic basis (for example, annually, quarterly or monthly), typically with 2 to 95 days' notice, depending on the fund and the liquidity profile of the underlying assets. in our perpetual capital vehicles where redemption rights exist, blackstone has the ability to fulfill redemption requests only (a) in blackstone's or the vehicles' board's discretion, as applicable, or (b) to the extent there is sufficient new capital. investment advisory agreements related to certain separately managed accounts in our credit & insurance and hedge fund solutions segments, excluding our bis separately managed accounts, may generally be terminated by an investor on 30 to 90 days' notice. our bis separately managed accounts can generally only be terminated for long-term underperformance, cause and certain other limited circumstances, in each case subject to blackstone's right to cure.
92
fee-earning assets under management refers to the assets we manage on which we derive management fees and/or performance revenues. we believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides insight into the capital base upon which we can earn management fees and/or performance revenues. our fee-earning assets under management equals the sum of:
(a)   for our private equity segment funds and real estate segment carry funds, including certain breds and hedge fund solutions funds, the amount of capital commitments, remaining invested capital, fair value, net asset value or par value of assets held, depending on the fee terms of the fund,
(b)   for our credit-focused carry funds, the amount of remaining invested capital (which may include leverage) or net asset value, depending on the fee terms of the fund,
(c)   the remaining invested capital or fair value of assets held in co-investment vehicles managed by us on which we receive fees,
(d)   the net asset value of our funds of hedge funds, hedge funds, bpp, certain co-investments managed by us, certain registered investment companies, breit, bepif, and certain of our hedge fund solutions drawdown funds,
(e)   the invested capital, fair value of assets or the net asset value we manage pursuant to separately managed accounts,
(f)   the net proceeds received from equity offerings and accumulated distributable earnings of bxmt, subject to certain adjustments,
(g)   the aggregate par amount of collateral assets, including principal cash, of our clos, and
(h)   the gross amount of assets (including leverage) or the net assets (plus leverage where applicable) for certain of our credit-focused registered investment companies.
each of our segments may include certain fee-earning assets under management on which we earn performance revenues but not management fees.
our calculations of total assets under management and fee-earning assets under management may differ from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers. in addition, our calculation of total assets under management includes commitments to, and the fair value of, invested capital in our funds from blackstone and our personnel, regardless of whether such commitments or invested capital are subject to fees. our definitions of total assets under management and fee-earning assets under management are not based on any definition of total assets under management and fee-earning assets under management that is set forth in the agreements governing the investment funds that we manage.
for our carry funds, total assets under management includes the fair value of the investments held and uncalled capital commitments, whereas fee-earning assets under management may include the total amount of capital commitments or the remaining amount of invested capital at cost depending on whether the investment period has expired or as specified by the fee terms of the fund. as such, in certain carry funds fee-earning assets under management may be greater than total assets under management when the aggregate fair value of the remaining investments is less than the cost of those investments.
perpetual capital perpetual capital refers to the component of assets under management with an indefinite term, that is not in liquidation, and for which there is no requirement to return capital to investors through redemption requests in the ordinary course of business, except where funded by new capital inflows. perpetual capital includes co-investment capital with an investor right to convert into perpetual capital. we believe this measure is useful to
93
stockholders as it represents capital we manage that has a longer duration and the ability to generate recurring revenues in a different manner than traditional fund structures.
dry powder dry powder represents the amount of capital available for investment or reinvestment, including general partner and employee capital, and is an indicator of the capital we have available for future investments. we believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides insight into the extent to which capital is available for blackstone to deploy capital into investment opportunities as they arise.
invested performance eligible assets under management invested performance eligible assets under management represents invested capital at fair value, including capital closed for funds whose investment period has not yet commenced, on which performance revenues could be earned if certain hurdles are met. we believe invested performance eligible assets under management is useful to stockholders as it provides insight into the capital deployed that has the potential to generate performance revenues.
recent tax developments recent and future changes to tax laws and regulations may create uncertainty for our business and investment strategies and could have an adverse impact on us. for example, the recently enacted inflation reduction act imposes, among other things, a minimum "book" tax on certain large corporations and creates a new excise tax on net stock repurchases made by certain publicly traded corporations after december 31, 2022. while the application of this new law is uncertain and we continue to evaluate its potential impact, these changes could materially change the amount and/or timing of tax blackstone inc. may be required to pay. for further discussion of potential consequences of changes in tax regulations, please see "- item 1a. risk factors - risks related to our business - changes in u.s. and foreign taxation of businesses and other tax laws, regulations or treaties or an adverse interpretation of these items by tax authorities could adversely affect us, including by adversely impacting our effective tax rate and tax liability."
consolidated results of operations following is a discussion of our consolidated results of operations. for a more detailed discussion of the factors that affected the results of our four business segments (which are presented on a basis that deconsolidates the investment funds, eliminates non-controlling ownership interests in blackstone's consolidated operating partnerships and removes the amortization of intangibles assets and transaction-related charges) in these periods, see "-segment analysis" below.

year ended december 31, 2022 compared to year ended december 31, 2021
revenues revenues were $8.5 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022, a decrease of $14.1 billion, or 62%, compared to $22.6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021. the decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to a decrease of $15.6 billion in investment income (loss), which is composed of decreases of $15.1 billion in unrealized investment income (loss) and $425.3 million in realized investment income (loss).
the $15.1 billion decrease in unrealized investment income (loss) was primarily attributable to net unrealized depreciation of investments in the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to net unrealized appreciation of investment holdings in the year ended december 31, 2021 in the segments. principal drivers of the decrease were:
•   a decrease of $6.7 billion in our real estate segment, primarily attributable to lower net unrealized appreciation of investments in brep and core+ during the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to the year ended december 31, 2021. brep and core+ carrying value increased 7.1% and 10.3%, respectively, in the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to increases of 43.8% and 25.0%, respectively, in the year ended december 31, 2021.
•   a decrease of $5.6 billion in our private equity segment, primarily attributable to net unrealized depreciation of investments in corporate private equity and lower net unrealized appreciation in strategic partners in the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to net unrealized appreciation of investments in the year ended december 31, 2021. corporate private equity and strategic partners carrying value decreased 0.6% and increased 8.5%, respectively, in the year ended december 31, 2022 compared to increases of 42.2% and 61.2%, respectively, in the year ended december 31, 2021.
•   a decrease of $1.3 billion in our credit &amp; insurance segment, primarily attributable to an unrealized loss on the ownership of corebridge common stock based on the publicly traded price as of december 31, 2022.
the $425.3 million decrease in realized investment income (loss) was primarily attributable to lower realized gains in our private equity segment, offset by higher realized gains in our real estate segment.
the $1.1 billion increase in management and advisory fees, net was primarily due to increases in our real estate and credit & insurance segments of $570.8 million and $455.8 million, respectively. the increase in our real estate segment was primarily due to fee-earning assets under management growth in core+ real estate. the increase in our credit & insurance segment was primarily due to an increase in inflows in bcred.
expenses expenses were $5.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022, a decrease of $4.5 billion, compared to $9.5 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021. the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of $4.8 billion in total compensation and benefits, composed of a decrease of $5.3 billion in performance allocations compensation and an increase of $407.8 million in compensation. the decrease in performance allocations compensation was primarily due to the decrease in investment income (loss) - performance allocations, on which a portion of performance allocations compensation is based.
other income (loss)
other income (loss) was $(82.9) million for the year ended december 31, 2022, a decrease of $541.7 million, compared to $458.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the decrease in other income (loss) was due to a decrease of $566.8 million in net gains (losses) from fund investment activities, partially offset by an increase of $25.0 million in change in tax receivable agreement liability.
96
the decrease in net gains (losses) from fund investment activities was principally driven by decreases of $265.4 million, $159.8 million and $111.2 million in our private equity, real estate and hedge fund solutions segments, respectively. the decrease in our private equity segment was primarily due to unrealized depreciation and lower realized gains of investments in our consolidated private equity funds. the decreases in our real estate and hedge fund solutions segments were primarily due to unrealized depreciation of investments in our consolidated real estate and hedge fund solutions funds.
the increase in change in tax receivable agreement liability was primarily attributable to a change in our state tax apportionment.
provision (benefit) for taxes blackstone's provision for taxes for the year ended december 31, 2022 was $472.9 million, a decrease of $711.5 million, compared to $1.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021. this resulted in an effective tax rate of 13.7% and 8.7% based on our income before provision for taxes of $3.5 billion and $13.6 billion for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
the increase in blackstone's effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2022, compared to the year ended december 31, 2021, resulted primarily from recent increases in blackstone's state tax provisions for the jurisdictions in which it operates and larger benefits recorded in december 31, 2021 for valuation allowance releases.
during the year ended december 31, 2022, blackstone recorded an out-of-period adjustment to revise the book investment basis used to calculate deferred tax assets and the deferred tax provision. the cumulative impact of the correction related to prior years resulted in a decrease in the provision for taxes and a corresponding increase to deferred tax assets for the year ended december 31, 2022.

non-controlling interests in consolidated entities the net income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests in consolidated entities and net income attributable to non-controlling interests in consolidated entities is attributable to the consolidated blackstone funds. the amounts of these items vary directly with the performance of the consolidated blackstone funds and largely eliminate the amount of other income (loss) - net gains (losses) from fund investment activities from the net income (loss) attributable to blackstone inc.
net income attributable to non-controlling interests in blackstone holdings is derived from the income before provision (benefit) for taxes at the blackstone holdings level, excluding the net gains (losses) from fund investment activities and the percentage allocation of the income between blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of blackstone holdings and blackstone after considering any contractual arrangements that govern the allocation of income such as fees allocable to blackstone.
for the years ended december 31, 2022 and 2021, the net income before taxes allocated to blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of blackstone holdings was 39.7% and 41.3%, respectively. the decrease of 1.6% was primarily due to the conversion of blackstone holdings partnership units to shares of common stock and the vesting of shares of common stock.
the other income (loss) - change in tax receivable agreement liability was entirely allocated to blackstone inc.

year ended december 31, 2022 compared to year ended december 31, 2021
segment distributable earnings were $4.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022, an increase of $1.1 billion, or 34%, compared to $3.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021. the increase in segment distributable earnings was primarily attributable to an increase of $1.1 billion in net realizations.
eighty percent of the aggregate net asset value of our global opportunistic and core+ real estate vehicles is concentrated in logistics, rental housing, hotels, life science office and data centers. we believe these sectors are more likely to withstand inflationary pressures given stronger relative cash flow growth, sustained robust demand and muted supply which has driven historically low vacancies. certain of these sectors also benefit from shorter duration leases, providing opportunity to capture growth in an inflationary environment. despite this strong operating performance, unrealized valuations in certain investments were adversely impacted by an environment characterized by higher interest rates and a rising cost of capital. certain funds have exposure to more challenged sectors such as traditional u.s. office buildings and assets with long-term leases which could be further adversely impacted by the current environment. with respect to realizations and deployment, continuing capital market volatility and economic uncertainty have contributed to muted activity, and this is likely to continue until market conditions improve.
fundraising in 2022 remained positive despite a challenging market backdrop and some near-term industry headwinds, perpetual capital strategies, including breit, represent an increasing percentage of total assets under
115
management in our real estate segment. beginning in late 2022, however, market volatility drove a material increase in breit repurchase requests, and pursuant to the terms of the vehicle, breit began to prorate such requests beginning in november 2022. concurrently, breit inflows were materially reduced, particularly after proration was announced. a continuation or worsening of the current environment could further adversely affect net flows in certain perpetual capital strategies for a more extended period of time. however, we believe the long-term growth trajectory remains positive and that strong investment performance and investor under-allocation to such strategies should drive flows over the long-term. see "part i. item 1a. risk factors - risks related to our business - we have increasingly undertaken business initiatives to increase the number and type of investment products we offer to individual investors, which could expose us to new and greater levels of risk."
fee related earnings fee related earnings were $2.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022, a decrease of $7.4 million, compared to $2.4 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021. the decrease in fee related earnings was attributable to a decrease of $619.6 million in fee related performance revenues and an increase of $80.8 million in other operating expenses, partially offset by an increase of $570.8 million in management fees, net and a decrease of $122.2 million in fee related compensation.
fee related performance revenues were $1.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022, a decrease of $619.6 million, compared to $1.7 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021. the decrease was primarily due to the crystallization of breit performance revenues.
other operating expenses were $315.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, an increase of $80.8 million, compared to $234.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the increase was primarily due to travel, entertainment, occupancy, technology-related expenses and professional fees.
management fees, net were $2.6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022, an increase of $570.8 million, compared to $2.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021, primarily driven by an increase in base management fees. base management fees increased $566.8 million primarily due to fee-earning assets under management growth in core+ real estate.
the annualized base management fee rate decreased from 1.09% at december 31, 2021 to 0.97% at december 31, 2022. the decrease was primarily due to the commencement of brep x, for which a significant portion of management fees are on a fee holiday through december 31, 2022, and growth in breds insurance vehicles, which have a lower management fee rate.
fee related compensation was $1.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022, a decrease of $122.2 million, compared to $1.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021. the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in fee related performance revenues, partially offset by an increase in management fees, net, both of which impact fee related compensation.
net realizations net realizations were $2.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022, an increase of $1.1 billion, or 125%, compared to $873.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the increase in net realizations was attributable to an increase of $1.9 billion in realized performance revenues, partially offset by an increase of $724.8 million in realized performance compensation and a decrease of $46.1 million in realized principal investment income.
realized performance revenues were $3.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022, an increase of $1.9 billion, compared to $1.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021. the increase was primarily due to higher realized performance revenues in brep.
116
realized performance compensation was $1.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022, an increase of $724.8 million, compared to $443.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the increase was primarily due to the increase in realized performance revenues.
realized principal investment income was $150.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, a decrease of $46.1 million, compared to $196.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the decrease was primarily due to the segment's allocation of the gain recognized in connection with the pátria investments limited and pátria investimentos ltda. (collectively, "pátria") sale transactions during the first and third quarters of 2021.

year ended december 31, 2022 compared to year ended december 31, 2021
segment distributable earnings were $1.7 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022, a decrease of $795.8 million, compared to $2.5 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021. the decrease in segment distributable earnings was attributable to a decrease of $796.7 million in net realizations.
despite some recent signs of moderation, tight labor markets and wage inflation have put profit margin pressure on certain of our private equity portfolio companies, especially those in labor-intensive businesses. these impacts should be mitigated as inflation moderates. moreover, the impact of such pressures on our overall private equity portfolio has been to some extent mitigated by its focus on investing in companies that are less impacted by rising input costs or that benefit from strong revenue growth and pricing power. with respect to realizations and deployment, continuing capital market volatility and economic uncertainty have contributed to more muted activity, and this is likely to continue until market conditions improve, which would negatively impact segment distributable earnings in our private equity segment. challenging market conditions have pressured investors' ability to allocate to private equity strategies and contributed to an already competitive fundraising environment. despite these near-term headwinds and a slower pace of fundraising, our institutional fundraising has remained positive and we have advanced considerably toward our overall flagship fundraise goal.
in energy, favorable market conditions contributed to a meaningful increase in the value of certain energy investments, as energy, oil and gas prices remained elevated in 2022. this trend, in part due to decreased supply because of the ongoing war between russia and ukraine, has had a positive impact on our energy portfolio. beyond this trend, however, increased scrutiny from regulators, investors and other market participants on the climate impact of oil and gas energy investments has weakened long-term growth prospects for traditional energy. the persistence of these weakened market fundamentals could negatively impact the performance of certain investments in our energy and corporate private equity funds.

realized performance revenues were $1.2 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022, a decrease of $1.1 billion, compared to $2.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2021. the decrease was primarily due to lower realized performance revenues in corporate private equity and tactical opportunities, partially offset by higher realized performance revenues in strategic partners.

(b)   bcep is a core private equity strategy which invests with a more modest risk profile and longer hold period than traditional private equity.
(c)   realizations are treated as return of capital until fully recovered and therefore inception to date realized returns are not applicable. returns are calculated from results that are reported on a three month lag from strategic partners' fund financial statements and therefore do not include the impact of economic and market activities in the current quarter.
funds with closed investment periods the corporate private equity funds within the private equity segment have nine funds with closed investment periods: bcp iv, bcp v, bcp vi, bcp vii, bcom, bep i, bep ii, bcep i and bcp asia i. as of december 31, 2022, bcp iv

was above its carried interest threshold (i.e., the preferred return payable to its limited partners before the general partner is eligible to receive carried interest) and would still be above its carried interest threshold even if all remaining investments were valued at zero. bcp v is comprised of two fund classes, the bcp v "main fund" and bcp v-ac fund. within these fund classes, the general partner is subject to equalization such that (a) the general partner accrues carried interest when the respective carried interest for either fund class is positive and (b) the general partner realizes carried interest so long as clawback obligations, if any, for either of the respective fund classes are fully satisfied. bcp v, bcp vi, bcp vii, bcom, bep i, bep ii, bcep i and bcp asia were above their respective carried interest thresholds. funds are considered above their carried interest thresholds based on the aggregate fund position, although individual limited partners may be below their respective carried interest thresholds in certain funds. we are entitled to retain previously realized carried interest up to 20% of bcom's net gains. as a result, performance revenues are recognized from bcom on current period gains and losses.

year ended december 31, 2022 compared to year ended december 31, 2021
segment distributable earnings were $1.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022, an increase of $464.5 million, or 86%, compared to $540.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the increase in segment distributable earnings was attributable to an increase of $485.7 million in fee related earnings, partially offset by a decrease of $21.2 million in net realizations.
while public spreads widened in 2022 amid market volatility and heightened uncertainty, rising interest rates and solid underlying company performance favorably impacted returns in our private credit strategies. while rising interest rates and the resulting higher cost of capital have the potential to negatively impact the free cash flow and credit quality of certain borrowers, the performance of our credit funds has generally benefited from rising interest rates as a substantial majority of the portfolio is floating rate. rising costs resulting from heightened energy prices and input costs have contributed to margin pressures at certain of our credit & insurance segment investments. such investments would continue to be negatively impacted by a sustained high rate of inflation if

they are unable to mitigate margin pressures, especially if concurrent with an increase in their debt service costs. if continued interest rate increases occur concurrently with a period of economic weakness or a slowdown in growth, portfolio performance in our credit & insurance segment may be negatively impacted. continued market dislocation may create attractive deployment opportunities, particularly for our private credit strategies, as borrowers seek alternative lending sources. nonetheless, significant market dislocation could limit the liquidity of certain assets traded in the credit markets, and this would impact our funds' ability to sell such assets at attractive prices or in a timely manner.
in energy, oil and gas prices remained elevated in 2022, in part due to decreased supply as a result of the ongoing war between russia and ukraine and heightened global demand. this short-term trend has had a positive impact on our energy portfolio. beyond this short-term trend, however, increased scrutiny from regulators, investors and other market participants on the climate impact of oil and gas energy investments has weakened long-term market fundamentals for traditional energy. the persistence of these weakened market fundamentals could negatively impact the performance of certain investments in our credit funds.
perpetual capital strategies, including bcred, represent an increasing percentage of total assets under management in our credit & insurance segment. beginning in late 2022, market volatility drove a material increase in bcred repurchase requests and a material decrease in inflows. this led to minimal net flows in bcred in the fourth quarter. a continuation or worsening of the current environment would further adversely affect our net flows for a more extended period of time. however, we believe the long-term growth trajectory remains positive and that strong investment performance and investor under-allocation to such private wealth strategies should drive flows over the long-term. see "item 1a. risk factors - risks related to our business - we have increasingly undertaken business initiatives to increase the number and type of investment products we offer to individual investors, which could expose us to new and greater levels of risk" in this report.
fee related earnings fee related earnings were $840.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, an increase of $485.7 million, or 137%, compared to $355.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the increase in fee related earnings was attributable to increases of $455.8 million in management fees, net and $256.6 million in fee related performance revenues, partially offset by increases of $162.5 million in fee related compensation and $64.3 million in other operating expenses.
management fees, net were $1.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2022, an increase of $455.8 million, compared to $804.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, primarily driven by an increase in base management fees. base management fees increased $464.8 million primarily due to inflows in bcred and bis.
fee related performance revenues were $374.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, an increase of $256.6 million, compared to $118.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the increase was primarily due to performance and an increase in subscriptions in bcred.
fee related compensation was $529.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, an increase of $162.5 million, compared to $367.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the increase was primarily due to increases in management fees, net and fee related performance revenues, both of which impact fee related compensation.
other operating expenses were $264.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, an increase of $64.3 million, compared to $199.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the increase was primarily due to travel, entertainment, occupancy and technology-related expenses and professional fees.

net realizations net realizations were $164.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, a decrease of $21.2 million, compared to $185.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the decrease in net realizations was attributable to a decrease of $62.0 million in realized performance revenues, partially offset by a decrease of $30.6 million in realized performance compensation.
realized performance revenues were $147.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, a decrease of $62.0 million, compared to $209.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the decrease was primarily attributable to lower realized performance revenues in our mezzanine funds.
realized performance compensation was $63.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, a decrease of $30.6 million, compared to $94.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in realized performance revenues.

year ended december 31, 2022 compared to year ended december 31, 2021
segment distributable earnings were $403.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, a decrease of $264.4 million, compared to $667.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the decrease in segment distributable earnings was attributable to decreases of $117.3 million in fee related earnings and $147.1 million in net realizations.
strategies across our hedge fund solutions segment navigated a year of significant market volatility caused by high inflation and escalating interest rates to generally outperform the broader market with significantly less volatility. the performance of some of the underlying managers in our hedge fund solutions segment, however, was adversely impacted by the challenging market environment. segment distributable earnings in the hedge fund solutions segment would likely be negatively impacted by a significant or sustained weak market environment or decline in asset prices, including as a result of concerns over macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. in addition, while certain of our strategies are designed to benefit from a rising interest rate environment, in an environment concurrently characterized by high interest rates and weak equity markets, it may be difficult for funds in certain strategies to exceed interest rate-based performance hurdles to which such funds are subject, which would negatively impact our segment distributable earnings.
outperformance relative to the broader market by strategies in our hedge fund solutions segment, particularly during times of meaningful equity market volatility, could contribute to increased flows in the segment. despite significant volatility in 2022, however, overall in recent years markets have experienced relatively low volatility, which has at times resulted in certain investors reallocating capital away from traditional hedge fund strategies. to the extent markets experience a prolonged period of low volatility and outperform our hedge fund strategies, investors may seek to reallocate capital away from traditional hedge fund strategies, which could negatively impact net flows in our hedge fund solutions segment. conversely, outperformance by our hedge fund solutions strategies in a weak market environment has in some cases resulted in such strategies representing an increasing portion of the value of certain investors' portfolios, which may limit such investors' ability to allocate additional capital to certain funds in the segment, or result in such investors seeking to withdraw capital from such funds. the hedge fund solutions segment operates multiple business lines, manages strategies that are both long and short asset classes and generates a majority of its revenue through management fees. in that regard, the segment's revenues depend in part on our ability to successfully grow such existing diverse business lines and strategies and to identify and scale new ones to meet evolving investor appetites. in recent years we have shifted the mix of our product offerings to include more products whose performance-based fees represent a more significant proportion of the fees earned from such products than has historically been the case.
fee related earnings fee related earnings were $279.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, a decrease of $117.3 million, compared to $396.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the decrease in fee related earnings was primarily attributable to a decrease of $76.6 million in management fees, net and increases of $30.2 million in fee related compensation and $10.5 million in other operating expenses.
management fees, net were $571.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, a decrease of $76.6 million, compared to $647.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2021, primarily driven by a decrease in base management fees. base management fees decreased $71.5 million primarily driven by a decrease in fee-earning assets under management in customized solutions and commingled products.
fee related compensation were $186.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, an increase of $30.2 million, compared to $156.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the increase was primarily due to compensation accruals, hiring and corporate allocations.
126
other operating expenses were $105.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, an increase of $10.5 million, compared to $94.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the increase was primarily due to travel and entertainment, and occupancy related expenses.
net realizations net realizations were $123.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, a decrease of $147.1 million, compared to $271.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the decrease in net realizations was primarily attributable to decreases of $153.8 million in realized performance revenues and $32.0 million in realized principal investment income, partially offset by a decrease of $38.7 million in realized performance compensation.
realized performance revenues were $137.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, a decrease of $153.8 million, compared to $291.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the decrease was primarily driven by reduced realized performance revenues in liquid and specialized solutions and in customized solutions and commingled products.
realized principal investment income was $24.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, a decrease of $32.0 million, compared to $56.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the decrease was primarily due to the segment's allocation of the gain recognized in the pátria sale transaction in the first and third quarters of 2021.
realized performance compensation was $38.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2022, a decrease of $38.7 million, compared to $76.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2021. the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in realized performance revenues.

the returns presented herein represent those of the applicable blackstone funds and not those of blackstone.
(a)   composite returns present a summarized asset-weighted return measure to evaluate the overall performance of the applicable class of blackstone funds.
(b)   baam's principal solutions ("bps") composite covers the period from january 2000 to present, although baam's inception date is september 1990. the bps composite includes only baam-managed commingled and customized multi-manager funds and accounts and does not include baam's individual investor solutions (liquid alternatives), strategic capital (seeding and gp minority stakes), strategic opportunities (co-invests), and advisory (non-discretionary) platforms, except for investments by bps funds directly into those platforms.
127
baam-managed funds in liquidation and, in the case of net returns, non-fee-paying assets are also excluded. the funds/accounts that comprise the bps composite are not managed within a single fund or account and are managed with different mandates. there is no guarantee that baam would have made the same mix of investments in a stand-alone fund/account. the bps composite is not an investible product and, as such, the performance of the bps composite does not represent the performance of an actual fund or account. the historical return is from january 1, 2000.

(a)   this adjustment removes transaction-related charges, which are excluded from blackstone's segment presentation. transaction-related charges arise from corporate actions including acquisitions, divestitures, and blackstone's initial public offering. they consist primarily of equity-based compensation charges, gains and losses on contingent consideration arrangements, changes in the balance of the tax receivable agreement resulting from a change in tax law or similar event, transaction costs and any gains or losses associated with these corporate actions.
129
(b)   this adjustment removes the amortization of transaction-related intangibles, which are excluded from blackstone's segment presentation. this amount includes amortization of intangibles associated with blackstone's investment in pátria, which was historically accounted for under the equity method. as a result of pátria's ipo in january 2021, equity method has been discontinued and there is no longer amortization of intangibles associated with the investment.
(c)   this adjustment reverses the effect of consolidating blackstone funds, which are excluded from blackstone's segment presentation. this adjustment includes the elimination of blackstone's interest in these funds and the removal of amounts associated with the ownership of blackstone consolidated operating partnerships held by non-controlling interests.
(d)   this adjustment removes unrealized performance revenues on a segment basis. the segment adjustment represents the add back of performance revenues earned from consolidated blackstone funds which have been eliminated in consolidation.

liquidity and capital resources general blackstone's business model derives revenue primarily from third party assets under management. blackstone is not a capital or balance sheet intensive business and targets operating expense levels such that total management and advisory fees exceed total operating expenses each period. as a result, we require limited capital resources to support the working capital or operating needs of our businesses. we draw primarily on the long-term committed capital of our limited partner investors to fund the investment requirements of the blackstone funds and use our own realizations and cash flows to invest in growth initiatives, make commitments to our own funds, where our minimum general partner commitments are generally less than 5% of the limited partner commitments of a fund, and pay dividends to stockholders and distributions to holders of holdings units.
fluctuations in our statement of financial condition result primarily from activities of the blackstone funds that are consolidated as well as business transactions, such as the issuance of senior notes described below. the majority economic ownership interests of such consolidated blackstone funds are reflected as redeemable non-controlling interests in consolidated entities, and non-controlling interests in consolidated entities in the consolidated financial statements. the consolidation of these blackstone funds has no net effect on blackstone's net income or equity. additionally, fluctuations in our statement of financial condition also include appreciation or depreciation in blackstone investments in the non-consolidated blackstone funds, additional investments and redemptions of such interests in the non-consolidated blackstone funds and the collection of receivables related to management and advisory fees.
132
total assets were $42.5 billion as of december 31, 2022, an increase of $1.3 billion from december 31, 2021. the increase in total assets was principally due to an increase of $3.3 billion in total assets attributable to consolidated blackstone funds, partially offset by a decrease of $1.5 billion in total assets attributable to consolidated operating partnerships. the increase in total assets attributable to consolidated blackstone funds was primarily due to an increase of $3.1 billion in investments. the increase in investments was primarily due to two newly consolidated blackstone funds. the decrease in total assets attributable to consolidated operating partnerships was primarily due to a decrease of $3.8 billion in investments, partially offset by an increase of $2.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents. the decrease in investments was primarily due to a decrease in accrued performance allocations, primarily attributable to realizations in excess of unrealized performance allocations. the increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to bond issuances and borrowings during the year, as described in "- sources and uses of liquidity."
total liabilities were $22.8 billion as of december 31, 2022, an increase of $3.4 billion, or 17%, from december 31, 2021. the increase in total liabilities was principally due to an increase of $1.9 billion in total liabilities attributable to consolidated operating partnerships and an increase of $1.5 billion in total liabilities attributable to consolidated blackstone funds. the increase in total liabilities attributable to consolidated operating partnerships and consolidated blackstone funds was primarily due to increases of $3.2 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, in loans payable, partially offset by a $1.8 billion decrease in accrued compensation and benefits attributable to consolidated operating partnerships. the increase in loans payable was primarily due to bond issuances and borrowings, as discussed in the previous paragraph. the decrease in accrued compensation and benefits was primarily due to a decrease in performance compensation.
we have multiple sources of liquidity to meet our capital needs as described in "- sources and uses of liquidity."
sources and uses of liquidity we have multiple sources of liquidity to meet our capital needs, including annual cash flows, accumulated earnings in our businesses, the proceeds from our issuances of senior notes, liquid investments we hold on our balance sheet and access to our $4.135 billion committed revolving credit facility. on june 3, 2022, blackstone amended and restated its revolving credit facility to, among other things, increase the amount of the revolving credit facility from $2.25 billion to $4.135 billion and to extend the maturity date of the revolving credit facility from november 24, 2025 to june 3, 2027. as of december 31, 2022, blackstone had $4.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $1.1 billion invested in corporate treasury investments and $3.5 billion in other investments (which included $3.1 billion of liquid investments), against $11.0 billion in borrowings from our bond issuances, and no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility.
on january 10, 2022, blackstone issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.550% senior notes due march 30, 2032 and $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.200% senior notes due january 30, 2052. for additional information see note 13. "borrowings" in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" in "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this filing and "- notable transactions."
on june 1, 2022, blackstone issued €500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.500% senior notes due june 1, 2034. for additional information see note 13. "borrowings" in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" in "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this filing and "- notable transactions."
on november 3, 2022, blackstone issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of 5.900% senior notes due november 3, 2027 and $900 million aggregate principal amount of 6.200% senior notes due april 22, 2033. for additional information see note 13. "borrowings" in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" in "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this filing and "- notable transactions."

in addition to the cash we received from our notes offerings and availability under our revolving credit facility, we expect to receive (a) cash generated from operating activities, (b) performance revenue realizations, and (c) realizations on the fund investments that we make. the amounts received from these three sources in particular may vary substantially from year to year and quarter to quarter depending on the frequency and size of realization events or net returns experienced by our investment funds. our available capital could be adversely affected if there are prolonged periods of few substantial realizations from our investment funds accompanied by substantial capital calls for new investments from those investment funds. therefore, blackstone's commitments to our funds are taken into consideration when managing our overall liquidity and cash position.
we expect that our primary liquidity needs will be cash to (a) provide capital to facilitate the growth of our existing businesses, which principally includes funding our general partner and co-investment commitments to our funds, (b) provide capital for business expansion, (c) pay operating expenses, including cash compensation to our employees, and other obligations as they arise, (d) fund modest capital expenditures, (e) repay borrowings and related interest costs, (f) pay income taxes, (g) repurchase shares of our common stock and blackstone holdings partnership units pursuant to our repurchase program and (h) pay dividends to our stockholders and distributions to the holders of blackstone holdings partnership units. for a tabular presentation of blackstone's contractual obligations and the expected timing of such see "- contractual obligations."

(a)   for some of the general partner commitments shown in the table above, we require our senior managing directors and certain other professionals to fund a portion of the commitment even though the ultimate obligation to fund the aggregate commitment is ours pursuant to the governing agreements of the respective funds. the amounts of the aggregate applicable general partner original and remaining commitment are shown in the table above. in addition, certain senior managing directors and other professionals may be required to fund a de minimis amount of the commitment in certain carry funds. we expect our commitments to be drawn down over time and to be funded by available cash and cash generated from operations and realizations. taking into account prevailing market conditions and both the liquidity and cash or liquid investment balances, we believe that the sources of liquidity described above will be more than sufficient to fund our working capital requirements.
(b)   represents capital commitments to a number of other funds in each respective segment.

(a)   we lease our primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that expire through 2043. occupancy lease agreements, in addition to contractual rent payments, generally include additional payments for certain costs incurred by the landlord, such as building expenses, and utilities. to the extent these are fixed or determinable they are included in the table above. the table above includes operating leases that are recognized as operating lease liabilities, short-term leases that are not recorded as operating lease liabilities and leases that have been signed but not yet commenced which are not recorded as operating lease liabilities. the amounts in this table are presented net of contractual sublease commitments.
(b)   represents the principal amount due on the senior notes we issued assuming no pre-payments are made and the notes are held until their final maturity. as of december 31, 2022, we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolver.
(c)   represents interest to be paid over the maturity of our senior notes which has been calculated assuming no pre-payments are made and debt is held until its final maturity date. these amounts include commitment fees for unutilized borrowings under our revolver.
139
(d)   these obligations represent commitments of the consolidated blackstone funds to make capital contributions to investee funds and portfolio companies. these amounts are generally due on demand and are therefore presented in the less than one year category.
(e)   represents obligations by blackstone's corporate subsidiary to make payments under the tax receivable agreements to certain non-controlling interest holders for the tax savings realized from the taxable purchases of their interests in connection with the reorganization at the time of blackstone's ipo in 2007 and subsequent purchases. the obligation represents the amount of the payments currently expected to be made, which are dependent on the tax savings actually realized as determined annually without discounting for the timing of the payments. as required by gaap, the amount of the obligation included in the consolidated financial statements and shown in note 18. "related party transactions" (see "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data") differs to reflect the net present value of the payments due to certain non-controlling interest holders.
(f)   as of december 31, 2022, there were no unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties. in addition, blackstone is not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with gross unrecognized benefits of $153.6 million and interest of $38.0 million; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligations table.
(g)   these obligations represent commitments by us to provide general partner capital funding to the blackstone funds, limited partner capital funding to other funds and blackstone principal investment commitments. these amounts are generally due on demand and are therefore presented in the less than one year category; however, a substantial amount of the capital commitments are expected to be called over the next three years. we expect to continue to make these general partner capital commitments as we raise additional amounts for our investment funds over time.
guarantees blackstone and certain of its consolidated funds provide financial guarantees. the amounts and nature of these guarantees are described in note 19. "commitments and contingencies - contingencies - guarantees" in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" in "-item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this filing.
indemnifications in many of its service contracts, blackstone agrees to indemnify the third party service provider under certain circumstances. the terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the above contractual obligations table or recorded in our consolidated financial statements as of december 31, 2022.
clawback obligations performance allocations are subject to clawback to the extent that the performance allocations received to date with respect to a fund exceed the amount due to blackstone based on cumulative results of that fund. the amounts and nature of blackstone's clawback obligations are described in note 19. "commitments and contingencies - contingencies - contingent obligations (clawback)" in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" in "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this filing.
share repurchase program on december 7, 2021, blackstone's board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.0 billion of common stock and blackstone holdings partnership units. under the repurchase program, repurchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. the timing and the actual number repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including legal requirements, price and economic and market conditions. the repurchase program may be changed, suspended or discontinued at any time and does not have a specified expiration date.
140
during the year ended december 31, 2022, blackstone repurchased 3.9 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $392.0 million. as of december 31, 2022, the amount remaining available for repurchases under the program was $1.1 billion.
dividends our intention is to pay to holders of common stock a quarterly dividend representing approximately 85% of blackstone inc.'s share of distributable earnings, subject to adjustment by amounts determined by our board of directors to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the conduct of our business, to make appropriate investments in our business and funds, to comply with applicable law, any of our debt instruments or other agreements, or to provide for future cash requirements such as tax-related payments, clawback obligations and dividends to stockholders for any ensuing quarter. the dividend amount could also be adjusted upward in any one quarter.
for blackstone's definition of distributable earnings, see "- key financial measures and indicators."
all of the foregoing is subject to the qualification that the declaration and payment of any dividends are at the sole discretion of our board of directors, and our board of directors may change our dividend policy at any time, including, without limitation, to reduce such quarterly dividends or even to eliminate such dividends entirely.
because the publicly traded entity and/or its wholly owned subsidiaries must pay taxes and make payments under the tax receivable agreements, the amounts ultimately paid as dividends by blackstone to common stockholders in respect of each fiscal year are generally expected to be less, on a per share or per unit basis, than the amounts distributed by the blackstone holdings partnerships to the blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of the blackstone holdings partnerships in respect of their blackstone holdings partnership units. following blackstone's conversion from a limited partnership to a corporation, we expect to pay more corporate income taxes than we would have as a limited partnership, which will increase this difference between the per share dividend and per unit distribution amounts.
dividends are treated as qualified dividends to the extent of blackstone's current and accumulated earnings and profits, with any excess dividends treated as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder's basis.
the following graph shows fiscal quarterly and annual per common stockholder dividends for 2022, 2021 and 2020. dividends are declared and paid in the quarter subsequent to the quarter in which they are earned.
141
with respect to fiscal year 2022, we paid to stockholders of our common stock a dividend of $1.32, $1.27, $0.90 and $0.91 per share in respect of the first, second, third and fourth quarters, respectively, aggregating to $4.40 per share of common stock. with respect to fiscal years 2021 and 2020, we paid stockholders of our common stock aggregate dividends of $4.06 per share and $2.26 per share, respectively.
leverage we may under certain circumstances use leverage opportunistically and over time to create the most efficient capital structure for blackstone and our stockholders. in addition to the borrowings from our notes issuances and our revolving credit facility, we may use reverse repurchase agreements, repurchase agreements and securities sold, not yet purchased. reverse repurchase agreements are entered into primarily to take advantage of opportunistic yields otherwise absent in the overnight markets and also to use the collateral received to cover securities sold, not yet purchased. repurchase agreements are entered into primarily to opportunistically yield higher spreads on purchased securities. the balances held in these financial instruments fluctuate based on blackstone's liquidity needs, market conditions and investment risk profiles.
142
the following table presents information regarding these financial instruments in our consolidated statements of financial condition:
repurchase                 securities agreements              sold, not yet purchased

maximum daily balance             $419.5                     $27.8
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap. in applying many of these accounting principles, we need to make assumptions, estimates and/or judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in our consolidated financial statements. we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. these assumptions, estimates and/or judgments, however, are often subjective. actual results may be affected negatively based on changing circumstances. if actual amounts are ultimately different from our estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. we believe the following critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying assumptions, estimates and/or judgments. for a description of our accounting policies, see note 2. "summary of significant accounting policies" in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" in "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this filing.
principles of consolidation for a description of our accounting policy on consolidation, see note 2. "summary of significant accounting policies - consolidation" and note 9. "variable interest entities" in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" in "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" for detailed information on blackstone's involvement with vies. the following discussion is intended to provide supplemental information about how the application of consolidation principles impact our financial results, and management's process for implementing those principles including areas of significant judgment.
the determination that blackstone holds a controlling financial interest in a blackstone fund or investment vehicle significantly changes the presentation of our consolidated financial statements. in our consolidated statements of financial position included in this filing, we present 100% of the assets and liabilities of consolidated vies along with a non-controlling interest which represents the portion of the consolidated vehicle's interests held by third parties. however, assets of our consolidated vies can only be used to settle obligations of the consolidated vie and are not available for general use by blackstone. further, the liabilities of our consolidated vies do not have recourse to the general credit of blackstone. in the consolidated statements of operations, we eliminate any management fees, incentive fees, or performance allocations received or accrued from consolidated vies as they are considered intercompany transactions. we recognize 100% of the consolidated vie's investment income (loss) and allocate the portion of that income (loss) attributable to third party ownership to non-controlling interests in arriving at net income attributable to blackstone inc.
143
the assessment of whether we consolidate a blackstone fund or investment vehicle we manage requires the application of significant judgment. these judgments are applied both at the time we become involved with the vie and on an ongoing basis and include, but are not limited to:
•   determining whether our management fees, incentive fees or performance allocations represent variable interests - we make judgments as to whether the fees we earn are commensurate with the level of effort required for those fees and at market rates. in making this judgment, we consider, among other things, the extent of third party investment in the entity and the terms of any other interests we hold in the vie.
•   determining whether kick-out rights are substantive - we make judgments as to whether the third party investors in a partnership entity have the ability to remove the general partner, the investment manager or its equivalent, or to dissolve (liquidate) the partnership entity, through a simple majority vote. this includes an evaluation of whether barriers to exercise these rights exist.
•   concluding whether blackstone has an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie - as there is no explicit threshold in gaap to define "potentially significant," management must apply judgment and evaluate both quantitative and qualitative factors to conclude whether this threshold is met.
revenue recognition for a description of our accounting policy on revenue recognition, see note 2. "summary of significant accounting policies -revenue recognition" in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" in "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data." for an additional description of the nature of our revenue arrangements, including how management fees, incentive fees, and performance allocations are generated, please refer to "part i. item 1. business - fee structure/incentive arrangements." the following discussion is intended to provide supplemental information about how the application of revenue recognition principles impact our financial results, and management's process for implementing those principles including areas of significant judgment.
management and advisory fees, net - blackstone earns base management fees from its customers at a fixed percentage of a calculation base which is typically assets under management, net asset value, gross asset value, total assets, committed capital or invested capital. the range of management fee rates and the calculation base from which they are earned, generally, are as follows:
on private equity, real estate, and certain of our hedge fund solutions and credit-focused funds:
•   0.25% to 1.75% of committed capital or invested capital during the investment period,
•   0.25% to 1.50% of invested capital, committed capital or investment fair value subsequent to the investment period for private equity and real estate funds, and
•   1.00% to 1.75% of invested capital or net asset value subsequent to the investment period for certain of our hedge fund solutions and credit-focused funds.
on real estate and credit-focused funds structured like hedge funds:
•   0.50% to 1.00% of net asset value.
on credit separately managed accounts:
•   0.20% to 1.35% of net asset value or total assets.
on real estate separately managed accounts:
•   0.65% to 2.00% of invested capital, net operating income or net asset value.
on insurance separately managed accounts and investment vehicles:
•   0.25% to 1.00% of net asset value.

on funds of hedge funds, certain hedge funds and separately managed accounts invested in hedge funds:
•   0.20% to 1.50% of net asset value.
on clo vehicles:
•   0.20% to 0.50% of the aggregate par amount of collateral assets, including principal cash.

the investment adviser of bxmt receives annual management fees based on 1.50% of bxmt's net proceeds received from equity offerings and accumulated "distributable earnings" (which is generally equal to its gaap net income excluding certain non-cash and other items), subject to certain adjustments. the investment advisers of breit and bepif receive a management fee of 1.25% per annum of net asset value, payable monthly.
management fee calculations based on committed capital or invested capital are mechanical in nature and therefore do not require the use of significant estimates or judgments. management fee calculations based on net asset value, total assets, or investment fair value depend on the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds. estimates and assumptions are made when determining the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds and could vary depending on the valuation methodology that is used as well as economic conditions. see "- fair value" below for further discussion of the judgment required for determining the fair value of the underlying investments.
investment income (loss) - performance allocations are made to the general partner based on cumulative fund performance to date, subject to a preferred return to limited partners. blackstone has concluded that investments made alongside its limited partners in a partnership which entitle blackstone to a performance allocation represent equity method investments that are not in the scope of the gaap guidance on accounting for revenues from contracts with customers. blackstone accounts for these arrangements under the equity method of accounting. under the equity method, blackstone's share of earnings (losses) from equity method investments is determined using a balance sheet approach referred to as the hypothetical liquidation at book value ("hlbv") method. under the hlbv method, at the end of each reporting period blackstone calculates the accrued performance allocations that would be due to blackstone for each fund pursuant to the fund agreements as if the fair value of the underlying investments were realized as of such date, irrespective of whether such amounts have been realized. performance allocations are subject to clawback to the extent that the performance allocation received to date exceeds the amount due to blackstone based on cumulative results.
the change in the fair value of the investments held by certain blackstone funds is a significant input into the accrued performance allocation calculation and accrual for potential repayment of previously received performance allocations. estimates and assumptions are made when determining the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds. see "- fair value" below for further discussion related to significant estimates and assumptions used for determining fair value of the underlying investments.
fair value blackstone uses fair value throughout the reporting process. for a description of our accounting policies related to valuation, see note 2. "summary of significant accounting policies - fair value of financial instruments" and "summary of significant accounting policies - investments at fair value" in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" in "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this filing. the following discussion is intended to provide supplemental information about how the application of fair value principles impact our financial results, and management's process for implementing those principles including areas of significant judgment.

the fair value of the investments held by blackstone funds is the primary input to the calculation of certain of our management fees, incentive fees, performance allocations and the related compensation we recognize. generally, blackstone funds are accounted for as investment companies under the american institute of certified public accountants accounting and auditing guide, investment companies, and in accordance with the gaap guidance on investment companies and reflect their investments, including majority-owned and controlled investments (the "portfolio companies"), at fair value. in the absence of observable market prices, we utilize valuation methodologies applied on a consistent basis and assumptions that we believe market participants would use to determine the fair value of the investments. for investments where little market activity exists management's determination of fair value is based on the best information available in the circumstances, which may incorporate management's own assumptions and involves a significant degree of judgment, and the consideration of a combination of internal and external factors, including the appropriate risk adjustments for non-performance and liquidity risks.
blackstone has also elected the fair value option for certain instruments it owns directly, including loans and receivables, investments in private debt securities and other proprietary investments. blackstone is required to measure certain financial instruments at fair value, including debt instruments, equity securities and freestanding derivatives.
fair value of investments or instruments that are publicly traded securities that are publicly traded and for which a quoted market exists will be valued at the closing price of such securities in the principal market in which the security trades, or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market on the valuation date. when a quoted price in an active market exists, no block discounts or control premiums are permitted regardless of the size of the public security held. in some cases, securities will include legal and contractual restrictions limiting their purchase and sale for a period of time. a discount to publicly traded price may be appropriate in instances where a legal restriction is a characteristic of the security, such as may be required under sec rule 144. the amount of the discount, if taken, shall be determined based on the time period that must pass before the restricted security becomes unrestricted or otherwise available for sale.
fair value of investments or instruments that are not publicly traded investments for which market prices are not observable include private investments in the equity or debt of operating companies or real estate properties. our primary methodology for determining the fair values of such investments is generally the income approach which provides an indication of fair value based on the present value of cash flows that a business, security, or property is expected to generate in the future. the most widely used methodology under the income approach is the discounted cash flow method which includes significant assumptions about the underlying investment's projected net earnings or cash flows, discount rate, capitalization rate and exit multiple. our secondary methodology, generally used to corroborate the results of the income approach, is typically the market approach. the most widely used methodology under the market approach relies upon valuations for comparable public companies, transactions, or assets, and includes making judgments about which companies, transactions, or assets are comparable. depending on the facts and circumstances associated with the investment, different primary and secondary methodologies may be used including option value, contingent claims or scenario analysis, yield analysis, projected cash flow through maturity or expiration, probability weighted methods or recent round of financing.

in certain cases debt and equity securities are valued on the basis of prices from an orderly transaction between market participants provided by reputable dealers or pricing services. in determining the value of a particular investment, pricing services may use certain information with respect to transactions in such investments, quotations from dealers, pricing matrices and market transactions in comparable investments and various relationships between investments.
management process on fair value due to the importance of fair value throughout the consolidated financial statements and the significant judgment required to be applied in arriving at those fair values, we have developed a process around valuation that incorporates several levels of approval and review from both internal and external sources. investments held by blackstone funds and investment vehicles are valued on at least a quarterly basis by our internal valuation or asset management teams, which are independent from our investment teams.
for investments valued utilizing the income method and where blackstone has information rights, we generally have a direct line of communication with each of the portfolio companies' and underlying assets' finance teams and collect financial data used to support projections used in a discounted cash flow analysis. the valuation team then analyzes the data received and updates the valuation models reflecting any changes in the underlying cash flow projections, weighted-average cost of capital, exit multiple or capitalization rate, and any other valuation input relevant economic conditions.
the results of all valuations of investments held by blackstone funds and investment vehicles are reviewed by the relevant business unit's valuation sub-committee, which is comprised of key personnel from the business unit, typically the chief investment officer, chief operating officer, chief financial officer, chief compliance officer (or their respective equivalents where applicable) and other senior managing directors in the business. to further corroborate results, each business unit also generally obtains either a positive assurance opinion or a range of value from an independent valuation party, at least annually for internally prepared valuations for investments that have been held by blackstone funds and investment vehicles for greater than a year and quarterly for certain investments. our firmwide valuation committee, chaired by our chief financial officer and comprised of senior members of our businesses and representatives from corporate functions, including legal and finance, reviews the valuation process for investments held by us and our investment vehicles, including the application of appropriate valuation standards on a consistent basis. each quarter, the valuation process is also reviewed by the audit committee of our board of directors, which is comprised of our non-employee directors.
income tax for a description of our accounting policy on taxes and additional information on taxes see note 2. "summary of significant accounting policies" and note 15. "income taxes," respectively, in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" in "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this filing.
our provision for income taxes is composed of current and deferred taxes. current income taxes approximate taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period. deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the applicable enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse.
additionally, significant judgment is required in estimating the provision for (benefit from) income taxes, current and deferred tax balances (including valuation allowance), accrued interest or penalties and uncertain tax positions. in evaluating these judgments, we consider, among other items, projections of taxable income (including the character of such income), beginning with historic results and incorporating assumptions of the amount of future pretax operating income. these assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates that blackstone uses to manage its business. to the extent any portion of the deferred tax assets are not considered to be more likely than not to be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded.
revisions in estimates and/or actual costs of a tax assessment may ultimately be materially different from the recorded accruals and unrecognized tax benefits, if any.

interbank offered rates transition certain jurisdictions are currently reforming or phasing out their benchmark interest rates, most notably libor across multiple currencies. many such reforms and phase outs became effective at the end of 2021 with select u.s. dollar libor tenors persisting through june 2023 and others potentially persisting on a synthetic basis through september 2024. blackstone has taken steps to prepare for and mitigate the impact of changing base rates and continues to manage transition efforts and evaluate the impact of prospective changes on existing transactions and contractual arrangements. see "part i. item 1a. risk factors - risks related to our business - interest rates on our and our portfolio companies' outstanding financial instruments might be subject to change based on regulatory developments, which could adversely affect our revenue, expenses and the value of those financial instruments."

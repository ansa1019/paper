overview we are a global leader in customer relationship management ("crm") technology that brings companies and customers together. with our customer 360 platform we deliver a single source of truth, connecting customer data across systems, apps and devices to help companies sell, service, market and conduct commerce, from anywhere. since our founding in 1999, we have pioneered innovations in cloud, mobile, social, analytics and artificial intelligence ("ai"), enabling companies of every size and industry to transform their businesses in the all-digital, work-from-anywhere era.
covid-19 impact in december 2019, the novel coronavirus and resulting disease ("covid-19") was first reported. after ongoing assessment of the rapid spread, number of cases and countries affected, on march 11, 2020, the world health organization characterized covid-19 as a pandemic. the covid-19 pandemic has created significant global economic uncertainty, adversely impacted the business of our customers and partners, impacted our business and results of operations and could further impact our results of operations and our cash flows in the future.
in response to the covid-19 pandemic, we have been guided by our core values of trust, customer success, innovation and equality. beginning in the first fiscal quarter and through the remainder of fiscal 2021, we took actions in response to the pandemic that focused on maintaining business continuity, supporting our employees, helping our customers and communities and preparing for the future and the long-term success of our business.
as a result of the pandemic, we experienced a slight decline in new business in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 as compared to the same prior-year period; however, new business grew during the remainder of fiscal 2021 at rates consistent with historical trends prior to covid-19. in addition, as a result of actions taken by us in response to the pandemic, we experienced incremental operating expenses and lower than expected operating cash flows for the full year of fiscal 2021, when compared to historical trends. for example, changes in billing frequency for new business and investments in our go-to-market efforts resulted in a negative impact to our operating cash flows during the year. in fiscal 2021, our income from operations benefited from our global work from home policy and limited business travel by our employees. we continue to evaluate our office space needs, and as a result we recorded approximately $216 million of impairments to assets associated with real estate leases in select locations we have decided to exit, of which approximately $184 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.
in addition, we have in the past implemented strategic realignments to position our company for future growth and will continue to do so, particularly as we evaluate the impact of covid-19 on our business. as part of our current strategic realignment, we have redirected and may in the future redirect some resources from areas that no longer align with our business priorities into key growth and strategic areas, as well as to increase investments in our go-to-market and product efforts. as a result of these investments and redirection efforts, which included some position eliminations, we saw an increase in expenses in fiscal 2021. in addition, as we continue to evaluate our office space needs, we may record additional impairments to associated assets. as we adjust and refine our strategy, there may be additional investments and redirection efforts in the future.
we do not yet know the impact the pandemic will have on our long-term revenue growth and profitability. authorities throughout the world have implemented numerous preventative measures to contain or mitigate further spread of the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, limitations on business activity, quarantines, work-from-home directives and shelter-in-place orders. these measures have caused, and could continue to cause, business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas, both regionally and worldwide. these business slowdowns and shutdowns have impacted and may continue to impact our business and results of operations. for example, the extent and duration of these measures could impact our ability to address cybersecurity incidents; have resulted in increased internet demand, which could cause access issues; could affect our ability to develop and support products and services; and could cause issues with access to data centers.
the ultimate extent of the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance depends on certain developments, including the duration of the pandemic and any resurgences, the severity of the disease, responsive actions taken by public health officials, the development, distribution and public acceptance of treatments and vaccines, the impacts on our customers and our sales cycles, our ability to generate new business leads, the impacts on our customers, employee and industry events, and the effects on our vendors, all of which are uncertain and currently cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty. as a result, the extent to which the covid-19 pandemic will continue to impact our financial condition or results of operations is uncertain. due to our primarily subscription-based business model, the effect of the covid-19 pandemic may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. if the covid-19 pandemic has a substantial impact on our employees', partners' or customers' productivity, our results of operations and overall financial performance may be harmed. in addition, the global macroeconomic effects of the covid-19 pandemic and related impacts on our customers' business operations and their demand for our products and services may persist for an indefinite period, even after the covid-19 pandemic has subsided.
see part i, item 1a. "risk factors" for further discussion of the impact and possible future impacts of the covid-19 pandemic on our business.
highlights from the fiscal year 2021.
•revenue: total fiscal 2021 revenue was $21.3 billion, an increase of 24 percent year-over-year.
•earnings per share: fiscal 2021 diluted earnings per share was $4.38 as compared to earnings per share of $0.15 from a year ago, and was benefited by approximately $2.0 billion from the one-time discrete tax benefit resulting from the recognition of deferred tax assets related to an intra-entity transfer of intangible property and an unrealized gain of $1.7 billion associated with the initial public offerings of two of our strategic investments.
•cash: cash provided by operations for fiscal 2021 was $4.8 billion, an increase of 11 percent year-over-year. total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities ended fiscal 2021 at $12.0 billion.
•remaining performance obligation: remaining performance obligation ended fiscal 2021 at approximately $36.1 billion, an increase of 17 percent year-over-year. current remaining performance obligation ended fiscal 2021 at approximately $18.0 billion, an increase of 20 percent year-over-year.
•acquisition: during fiscal 2021, we completed the acquisition of vlocity, inc. ("vlocity") for $1.4 billion, consisting primarily of $1.2 billion in cash. additionally, during fiscal 2021, we announced our pending acquisition of slack technologies, inc. ("slack"), a leading channel-based messaging platform, which is expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, for an estimated $15.6 billion in cash and 45 million shares of salesforce common stock, based on slack class a and class b shares outstanding as of january 31, 2021.
we continue to invest for future growth and are focused on several key growth levers, including driving multi-cloud adoption, increasing our penetration with enterprise and international customers and our industry-specific reach with more vertical software solutions. these growth drivers often require a more sophisticated go-to-market approach and, as a result, we may incur additional costs upfront to obtain new customers and expand our relationships with existing customers, including additional sales and marketing expenses specific to subscription and support revenue. as a result, we have seen that customers with many of these characteristics have lower attrition rates than our company average.
we plan to continue to reinvest a significant portion of our income from operations in future periods to grow and innovate our business and service offerings and expand our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. we drive innovation organically and, to a lesser extent, through acquisitions. we regularly evaluate acquisitions and investment opportunities in complementary businesses, joint ventures, services, technologies and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our service offerings and to nurture the overall ecosystem for our offerings. past acquisitions have enabled us to deliver innovative solutions in new categories, including analytics and integration. we continue to evaluate investment opportunities and expect to continue to make investments and acquisitions in the future, such as our pending acquisition of slack. slack has an integrated value proposition across all of our service offerings and, upon close of the transaction and successful product integration, we believe it will further enable companies to grow and succeed in an all-digital, work-from-anywhere era.
as a result of our aggressive growth plans and integration of our previously acquired businesses, we have incurred significant expenses for equity awards and amortization of purchased intangibles, which have reduced our operating income.
we periodically make changes to our sales organization to position us for long-term growth, which has in the past and could again in the future result in temporary disruptions to our sales productivity. in addition, we have experienced, and may at times in the future experience, more variation from our forecasted expectations of new business activity due to longer and less predictable sales cycles and increasing complexity of our business, which includes an expanded mix of products and various revenue models resulting from acquisitions and increased enterprise solution selling activities. slower growth in new business in a given period could negatively affect our revenues in future periods, as well as remaining performance obligation in current or future periods, particularly if experienced on a sustained basis.
the expanding global scope of our business and the heightened volatility of global markets, including as a result of covid-19, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates had a modest favorable impact on our revenue results for fiscal 2021. in addition, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates had a modest favorable impact on both our remaining performance obligation and current remaining performance obligation as of january 31, 2021. we expect these fluctuations to continue in the future.
fiscal year our fiscal year ends on january 31. references to fiscal 2021, for example, refer to the fiscal year ending january 31, 2021.
operating segments we operate as one segment. see note 1 "summary of business and significant accounting policies" to the consolidated financial statements for our discussion about segments.
sources of revenues we derive our revenues from two sources: subscription and support revenues and related professional services. subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 94 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2021.
subscription and support revenues are primarily comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services (collectively, "cloud services"). cloud services allow customers to use our multi-tenant software without taking possession of the software. revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term. with the may 2018 acquisition of mulesoft and the august 2019 acquisition of tableau, subscription and support revenues also include revenues associated with software licenses. software license revenues include fees from the sales of term and perpetual licenses. revenues from software licenses are generally recognized upfront when the software is made available to the customer and revenues from the related support are generally recognized ratably over the contract term. changes in contract duration for multi-year licenses can impact the amount of revenues recognized upfront. revenues from software licenses represent less than ten percent of total subscription and support revenue for fiscal 2021.
the revenue growth rates of each of our service offerings, as described below in "results of operations," fluctuate from quarter to quarter and over time. additionally, we manage the total balanced product portfolio to deliver solutions to our customers and, as a result, the revenue result for each offering is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarter. in addition, some of our cloud service offerings have similar features and functions. for example, customers may use our sales, service or platform service offering to record account and contact information, which are similar features across these service offerings. depending on a customer's actual and projected business requirements, more than one service offering may satisfy the customer's current and future needs. we record revenue based on the individual products ordered by a customer, not according to the customer's business requirements and usage.
our growth in revenues is also impacted by attrition. attrition represents the reduction or loss of the annualized value of our contracts with customers. we calculate our attrition rate at a point in time on a trailing twelve-month basis as of the end of each month. as of january 31, 2021, our attrition rate, excluding our integration service offering, salesforce.org and tableau, was between 9.0% and 9.5%. prior to fiscal year 2021, our attrition rate excluded our commerce service offering. in general, we exclude service offerings from acquisitions from our attrition calculation until they are fully integrated into our customer success organization. while our attrition rate is difficult to predict, we expect it to remain consistent or slightly better in the near term due to the diversity of size, industry and geography within the customer base. however, our attrition rate may increase over time, including, for example, as a result of covid-19.
we continue to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives which, along with increasing enterprise adoption, have helped keep our attrition rate consistent as compared to the prior year. consistent attrition rates play a role in our ability to maintain growth in our subscription and support revenues.
seasonal nature of unearned revenue, accounts receivable and operating cash flow unearned revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. we generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in unearned revenue or in revenue depending on whether transfer of control to customers has occurred. in general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. we typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. there is a disproportionate weighting toward annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. the year-on-year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. accordingly, because of this billing activity, our first quarter is typically our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. conversely, our third quarter has historically been our smallest operating cash flow quarter. in response to covid-19, we offered temporary financial flexibility to some customers in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and changed billing frequencies for other customers throughout fiscal 2021, which has delayed payments to periods later than expected. we also have accelerated our investments in our go-to-market and product efforts throughout fiscal 2021, which resulted in increased expenses and a negative impact to operating cash flow. these efforts have affected and may continue to affect trends related to the seasonal nature of unearned revenue, accounts receivable and operating cash flow. unearned revenues, accounts receivable and operating cash flow may also be impacted by acquisitions. for example, operating cash flows may be adversely impacted by acquisitions due to transaction costs, financing costs such as interest expense and lower operating cash flows from the acquired entity.
the sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable and the related unearned revenue and operating cash flow during the first quarter of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs for the following quarters as displayed below (in millions).
remaining performance obligation our remaining performance obligation represents all future revenue under contract that has not yet been recognized as revenue and includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts. our current remaining performance obligation represents future revenue under contract that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months.
remaining performance obligation is not necessarily indicative of future revenue growth and is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the timing of renewals, average contract terms, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in new business growth. remaining performance obligation is also impacted by acquisitions. unbilled portions of the remaining performance obligation denominated in foreign currencies are revalued each period based on the period end exchange rates. for multi-year subscription agreements billed annually, the associated unbilled balance and corresponding remaining performance obligation are typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero just prior to renewal, and increase if the agreement is renewed. low remaining performance obligation attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal but may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer. changes in contract duration can impact remaining performance obligation and current remaining performance obligation.
remaining performance obligation consisted of the following (in billions):
cost of revenues and operating expenses impact of acquisitions the comparability of our operating results is impacted by our recent acquisitions, including our acquisition of vlocity in june 2020 and our acquisition of tableau in august 2019. expense contributions by expense type from our recent acquisitions generally may not be separately identifiable due to the integration of these businesses into our existing operations, or may be insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented.
cost of revenues cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to delivering our service and providing support, including the costs of data center capacity, certain fees paid to various third parties for the use of their technology, services and data and employee-related costs such as salaries and benefits.
cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including stock-based expenses, the cost of subcontractors and certain third-party fees. we expect the cost of professional services to be approximately in line with revenues from professional services in future fiscal periods. we believe that this investment in professional services facilitates the adoption of our service offerings.
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses and allocated overhead.
marketing and sales marketing and sales expenses make up the majority of our operating expenses and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses and commissions, for our sales and marketing staff, as well as payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building and product marketing activities. we capitalize certain costs to obtain customer contracts, such as commissions, and amortize these costs on a straight-line basis. payments of these commissions are not consistent with the period in which the expense is recognized.
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based expenses, for finance and accounting, legal, internal audit, human resources and management information systems personnel and professional services fees.
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
we believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in note 1 "summary of business and significant accounting policies" to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies and specific estimates involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity.
revenue recognition - contracts with multiple performance obligations. we enter into contracts with our customers that may include promises to transfer multiple cloud services, software licenses, premium support and professional services. a performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer products or services that are distinct. determining whether products and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as one unit of accounting may require significant judgment.
cloud services and software licenses are distinct as such offerings are often sold separately. in determining whether professional services are distinct, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription start date and the contractual dependence of the service on the customer's satisfaction with the professional services work. to date, we have concluded that professional services included in contracts with multiple performance obligations are generally distinct.
we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price ("ssp") basis. the ssp is the price at which we would sell a promised product or service separately to a customer. judgment is required to determine the ssp for each distinct performance obligation. we determine ssp by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions. significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where services are sold, price lists, our go-to-market strategy, historical sales and contract prices. in instances where we do not sell or price a product or service separately, we determine relative fair value using information that may include market conditions or other observable inputs. as our go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes to ssp.
in certain cases, we are able to establish ssp based on observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. we use a single amount to estimate ssp when it has observable prices. if ssp is not directly observable, for example when pricing is highly variable, we use a range of ssp. we determine the ssp range using information that may include pricing practices or other observable inputs. we typically have more than one ssp for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customer size and geography.
costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts. costs capitalized related to new revenue contracts are amortized on a straight-line basis over four years, which, although longer than the typical initial contract period, reflects the average period of benefit, including expected contract renewals. significant judgment is required in arriving at this average period of benefit. therefore, we evaluate both qualitative and quantitative factors, including the estimated life cycles of our offerings and our customer attrition.
business combinations. accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and pre-acquisition contingencies. we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as the useful lives of those acquired intangible assets.
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired are:
•future expected cash flows from subscription and support contracts, professional services contracts, other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;
•historical and expected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customers;
•assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name will continue to be used in our offerings;
•discount rates;
•uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances assumed;
•fair value of assumed equity awards; and
•fair value of pre-existing relationships.
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.
income taxes. valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character, for example, ordinary income or capital gains, within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the applicable tax law. we regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and tax planning strategies. should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed.
our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. we recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. the tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. we recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision.
in fiscal 2021, we changed our international corporate structure, which included the transfer of certain intangible property between foreign affiliates resulting in a net tax benefit of $2.0 billion related to foreign deferred tax assets. the deferred tax assets were recognized as a result of the book and tax basis difference on the intangible property and were based on the intangible property's current fair value. in determining the estimated fair value of the intangible property, we made significant estimates and assumptions including, but not limited to, projected revenues, operating expenses and geographic earnings mix in the valuation models. we believe that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, and will regularly evaluate its realizability.
strategic investments. accounting for strategic investments in privately held debt and equity securities in which we do not have a controlling interest or significant influence requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions.
valuations of privately held securities are inherently complex and require judgment due to the lack of readily available market data. privately held debt and equity securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. the carrying values of our privately held equity securities are adjusted if there are observable price changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that may indicate impairment, as discussed below. in determining the estimated fair value of our strategic investments in privately held companies, we utilize the most recent data available, as adjusted to reflect the specific rights and preferences of those securities we hold.
we assess our privately held debt and equity securities strategic investment portfolio quarterly for impairment. our impairment analysis encompasses an assessment of both qualitative and quantitative analyses of key factors including the investee's financial metrics, market acceptance of the product or technology, and the rate at which the investee is using its cash. if the investment is considered to be impaired, we record the investment at fair value by recognizing an impairment through the consolidated statement of operations and establishing a new carrying value for the investment.
the particular privately held debt and equity securities we hold, and their rights and preferences relative to those of other securities within the capital structure, may impact the magnitude by which our investment value moves in relation to movement of the total enterprise value of the company. as a result, our investment value in a specific company may move by more or less than any change in the value of that overall company. an immediate decrease of ten percent in enterprise value of our largest privately held equity securities held as of january 31, 2021 could result in a $66 million reduction in the value of our investment portfolio.

remaining performance obligation represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue in future periods.
impact of acquisitions the comparability of our operating results for the fiscal year ended january 31, 2021 compared to the same period of fiscal 2020 was impacted by our acquisitions in the current and prior year, including the acquisition of tableau in the prior year, which was our largest acquisition to date. in our discussion of changes in our results of operations for the fiscal year ended january 31, 2021 compared to the same periods of fiscal 2020, we may quantitatively disclose the impact of our acquired products and services for the fiscal year subsequent to the acquisition date on the growth in certain of our revenues where such discussions would be meaningful. expense contributions from our recent acquisitions for each of the respective period comparisons generally were not separately identifiable due to the integration of these businesses into our existing operations or were insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented.

the increase in subscription and support revenues was primarily caused by volume-driven increases from new business, which includes new customers, upgrades, additional subscriptions from existing customers and acquisition activity. pricing was not a significant driver of the increase in revenues for the period. revenues from term and perpetual software licenses, which are recognized at a point in time, represent approximately six percent of total subscription and support revenues for fiscal 2021. subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 94 percent of our total revenues for both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020.
the acquisition of tableau in august 2019 contributed approximately $1.5 billion and $652 million to total subscription and support revenues in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively, and is included in the above amounts. as a result of our business combination activity, we recorded unearned revenue related to acquired contracts from acquired entities at fair value on the date of acquisition. as a result, we did not recognize certain revenues related to these acquired contracts that the acquired entities would have otherwise recorded as an independent entity.
the increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of customers.

our industry offerings revenue is included in either sales, service or platform and other depending on the primary service offering purchased. subscription and support revenues from platform and other benefited from a full twelve months of revenue from the acquisition of tableau in fiscal 2021 as compared to six months in fiscal 2020. the revenue growth rates of each of our core service offerings have been and may be impacted by covid-19 in the future, depending on our customers' actual and projected business needs. for example, we experienced increased demand for our marketing and commerce service offering for fiscal 2021 when compared to prior periods.

revenues by geography are determined based on the region of the salesforce contracting entity, which may be different than the region of the customer. the increase in americas revenues was the result of the increasing acceptance of our services and the investment of additional sales resources. the increase in revenues outside of the americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our services, our focus on marketing our services internationally and investment in additional international sales resources. revenues in the americas and europe also benefited from our acquisition of tableau in august 2019. foreign currency fluctuations had a minimal impact on revenues outside of the americas for fiscal 2021 and 2020.

for fiscal 2021, the increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to an increase of $330 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $37 million in stock-based expenses, an increase of $275 million in service delivery costs primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity, an increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets of $222 million and an increase in third party fees and allocated overhead. service delivery costs associated with our perpetual and term software licenses are lower than service delivery costs associated with our cloud service offerings and as a result, our subscription and support gross margin in fiscal 2021 benefited, in part, due to this shift in our business mix.
we have increased our headcount associated with our data centers, customer support, and professional services by 18 percent since fiscal 2020 to meet the higher demand for services from our customers, and our recent acquisitions also contributed to this increase. we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity to allow us to scale with our customers and continuously evolve our security measures. we also plan to add employees in our professional services group to facilitate the adoption of our services. the timing of these expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in future periods.

for fiscal 2021, the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase of approximately $508 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $193 million in stock-based expenses, and increases in our development and test data center costs and allocated overhead. our research and development headcount increased by 11 percent since fiscal 2020 in order to improve and extend our service offerings, develop new technologies and integrate acquired companies. we expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods as we continue to invest in additional employees and technology to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired technologies.
for fiscal 2021, the increase in marketing and sales expenses was primarily due to an increase of $1.4 billion in employee-related costs and amortization of deferred commissions, an increase of $89 million in stock-based expenses, an increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets of $107 million, and allocated overhead partially offset by a reduction in employee travel and expenses. marketing and sales expenses for fiscal 2021 were also negatively impacted by the one-time partial minimum commission guarantee offered to our direct sales force. our marketing and sales headcount increased by 14 percent since fiscal 2020, primarily attributable to hiring additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. we expect that marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods as we continue to hire additional sales personnel. we also expect an increase in marketing and sales expenses due to the gradual increase of travel and related expenses in the second half of fiscal 2022.
for fiscal 2021, the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in employee-related costs as well as being impacted by our charitable donations to members of our ecosystem and community. our general and administrative headcount increased by 12 percent since fiscal 2020 as we added personnel to support our growth. while not material to date, we may experience increasing credit loss risks from accounts receivable in future periods depending on the duration or degree of economic slowdown caused by the covid-19 pandemic, and our actual experience in the future may differ from our past experiences or current assessments.
as a result of the june 2019 salesforce.org business combination, we effectively settled all existing agreements between ourselves and salesforce.org and, as part of business combination accounting, accordingly recorded a one-time, non-cash operating expense charge of approximately $166 million in fiscal 2020 related to the effective settlement of the reseller agreement.

gains on strategic investments, net consists primarily of mark-to-market adjustments related to our publicly held equity securities, observable price adjustments related to our privately held equity securities and other adjustments. net gains recognized during fiscal 2021 were primarily driven by unrealized gains recognized on publicly traded equity securities of $1.7 billion and realized gains on sales of equity securities of $0.4 billion.
other expense primarily consists of interest expense on our debt as well as our operating and finance leases offset by investment income. interest expense was $126 million and $131 million for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. investment income decreased $34 million in fiscal 2021, respectively, compared to the same period a year ago due to lower interest rates across our portfolio, modestly offset by larger cash equivalents and marketable securities balances. upon closing of our acquisition of slack, we expect an increase in interest expense due to debt agreements we plan to enter into in connection with the pending acquisition.

in fiscal 2021, we recognized a tax benefit of $1.5 billion on a pretax income of $2.6 billion. in the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we changed our international corporate structure, which included the transfer of certain intangible property between foreign affiliates resulting in a net tax benefit of $2.0 billion related to foreign deferred tax assets. the deferred tax assets were recognized as a result of the book and tax basis difference on the intangible property and were based on the intangible property's current fair value. the determination of the estimated fair value of the intangible property is complex and judgmental due to the use of subjective assumptions in the valuation models used by management. the tax amortization related to the intellectual property transferred will be recognized in future periods and any amortization that is unused in a particular year can be carried forward indefinitely under irish tax laws. the deferred tax asset and the tax benefit were measured based on the currently enacted irish tax rate. we believe that it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized in ireland.
in fiscal 2020, we recognized a tax provision of $580 million on a pretax income of $706 million. our tax provision was primarily driven by incremental tax costs associated with the integration of acquired operations and assets and profitable jurisdictions outside of the united states.
fiscal year ended january 31, 2020 and 2019
for a discussion of the year ended january 31, 2020 compared to the year ended january 31, 2019, please refer to part ii, item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended january 31, 2020.
liquidity and capital resources at january 31, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $12.0 billion and accounts receivable of $7.8 billion. our cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and obligations, u.s. treasury securities, u.s. agency obligations, asset-backed securities, foreign government obligations, mortgage-backed obligations, covered bonds, time deposits, money market mutual funds and municipal securities. our revolving loan credit agreement, which provides the ability to borrow up to $3.0 billion in unsecured financing ("credit facility") as of january 31, 2021, also serves as a source of liquidity.
as of january 31, 2021, our remaining performance obligation was $36.1 billion. our remaining performance obligation represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized and includes unearned revenue, which has been invoiced and is recorded on the balance sheet, and unbilled amounts that are not recorded on the balance sheet, that will be recognized as revenue in future periods.
cash from operations could continue to be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the effects of the covid-19 pandemic and other risks detailed in part i, item 1a titled "risk factors." we believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash provided by operating activities, unbilled amounts related to contracted non-cancelable subscription agreements, which is not reflected on the balance sheet, and, if necessary, our borrowing capacity under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure and debt repayment needs over the next 12 months. in addition, we expect to have a sufficient combination of available cash and borrowing capacity to fund the aggregate cash portion of the pending acquisition of slack, which is expected to be approximately $15.6 billion. sources of financing associated with our pending acquisition of slack are detailed below in "debt."
in the future, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies, and intellectual property rights. to facilitate these acquisitions or investments, we may seek additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all, impacting our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions or investments.
cash flows for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, our cash flows were as follows (in millions):

operating activities the net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2021 was primarily related to net income of $4.1 billion, adjusted for non-cash items including $2.0 billion from a one-time discrete tax item from the recognition of deferred tax assets related to an intra-entity transfer of certain intangible property, $2.8 billion of depreciation and amortization and $2.2 billion of expenses related to employee stock plans, as well as adjusted for $2.2 billion of gains on strategic investments. cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2021 further benefited by the change in unearned revenue of $1.9 billion, offset by a change in accounts receivable, net of $1.6 billion. cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2021 was negatively impacted by changes in billing frequency for new business due to the covid-19 pandemic. in addition, our operating cash flows were negatively impacted by investments made in our go-to-market efforts, such as the partial minimum commission guarantee provided in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.
the net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2020 was primarily related to net income of $126 million, adjusted for non-cash items such as $2.1 billion related to depreciation and amortization, $1.8 billion of expenses related to employee stock plans and discrete one-time non-cash adjustments.
investing activities the net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2021 was primarily related to cash consideration for the acquisition of vlocity, net of cash acquired, of approximately $1.2 billion as well as purchases of marketable securities of $4.8 billion, partially offset by sales and maturities of marketable securities of $2.9 billion. in addition, we paid approximately $150 million of cash consideration related to the purchase of the property located at 450 mission street ("450 mission") in san francisco, ca, which is reflected in capital expenditures.
the net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2020 was primarily related to the purchases of marketable securities of $3.9 billion, offset by sales and maturities of marketable securities of $2.2 billion. in addition, we paid approximately $0.4 billion of cash consideration, net of cash acquired, for business combinations during fiscal 2020.
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2021 consisted primarily of $1.3 billion from proceeds from equity plans.
net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2020 consisted primarily of $840 million from proceeds from equity plans offset by repayments of debt of $503 million, including repayment of our senior unsecured term loan facility that would have matured in april 2021, and principal payments on financing obligations of $173 million.
debt as of january 31, 2021, we had senior unsecured debt outstanding due in 2023 and 2028 with a total carrying value of $2.5 billion. in addition, we had senior secured notes outstanding related to our loan on our purchase of an office building located at 50 fremont street in san francisco ("50 fremont"), due in 2023 with a total carrying value of $190 million. we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of january 31, 2021.
in december 2020, we entered into a credit agreement (the "revolving loan credit agreement"), which provides for a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the "credit facility") that matures in december 2025, replacing our previous $1.0 billion revolving credit facility. there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility as of january 31, 2021. we may use the proceeds of future borrowings under the credit facility for general corporate purposes, which may include, without limitation, financing the considerations for and fees, costs and expenses related to any acquisition.
in addition, in connection with our pending acquisition of slack, in december 2020, we obtained commitments from certain financial institutions for a 364-day senior unsecured bridge loan facility (the "bridge facility"). the original commitments in respect of the bridge facility were $10.0 billion, but were reduced to $7.0 billion in december 2020 following our entry into a $3.0 billion three-year senior unsecured loan agreement ("acquisition term loan"), the proceeds of which may be used to finance a portion of the cash consideration for our pending acquisition of slack, for the repayment of certain debt of slack to pay fees, costs and expenses related thereto. in february 2021, we elected to further reduce our bridge facility commitments to $4.0 billion. the availability and funding of the bridge facility and the acquisition term loan are conditioned on the consummation of the acquisition of slack in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement and are subject to certain exceptions, qualifications and certain other conditions. we may further reduce the commitments in respect of the bridge facility prior to the consummation of the acquisition, all or a portion of which may be in connection with the issuance of one or more series of senior secured debt securities or other incurrences of new indebtedness or commitments in respect thereof.
we do not have any special purpose entities and we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
contractual obligations our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space, co-location data center facilities and our development and test data center, as well as leases for computer equipment, software, furniture and fixtures. for more information regarding our lease obligations, see note 6 "leases and other commitments" to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii. in addition, we have a substantial level of debt. for more information regarding our debt service obligations, see note 9 "debt" to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 of part ii. as of january 31, 2021, our other contractual commitments associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms were payments of $0.6 billion due in the next 12 months and $1.9 billion due thereafter. we expect to fund these obligations with cash flows from operations and cash on our balance sheet.
during fiscal 2021 and in future fiscal years, we have made and expect to continue to make additional investments in our infrastructure to scale our operations, increase productivity and enhance our security measures. we plan to upgrade or replace various internal systems to scale with our overall growth. while we continue to make investments in our infrastructure including offices, information technology and data centers to provide capacity for the growth of our business, our strategy may continue to change related to these investments and we may slow the pace of our investments including in response to the known and potential impacts of covid-19 on our business.
other future obligations in december 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire slack. under the terms of the agreement, slack shareholders will receive $26.79 in cash and 0.0776 shares of salesforce common stock for each outstanding share of slack class a and class b common stock, resulting in an estimated $15.6 billion of cash consideration and 45 million shares to be issued, based on slack class a and class b shares outstanding as of january 31, 2021. the agreement also provides for the assumption of outstanding equity awards held by slack employees. we expect to fund the cash portion of the consideration with a combination of new debt, as discussed above, and cash on our balance sheet.
in february 2021, we acquired all outstanding stock of acumen solutions, inc. ("acumen") for approximately $433 million, in cash.
in october 2019, we acquired clicksoftware for approximately $1.4 billion. in the event that we fully integrate the operations and assets of clicksoftware, as well as other acquired israeli based entities into our operations, we may be subject to a potential one-time income tax charge based on an assumed israeli statutory tax rate of 23 percent applied to the value of any transferred intangibles. the timing and amount of the cash payment, if any, is uncertain and would be based upon a number of factors, including our integration plans, valuations related to intercompany transactions, the tax rate in effect at the time, potential negotiations with the taxing authorities and potential litigation.
environmental, social, governance we believe the business of business is to make the world a better place for all of our stakeholders, including our stockholders, customers, employees, partners, the planet and the communities in which we work and live. we believe that values drive value, and that effectively managing our priority environmental, social, and governance ("esg") topics will help create long-term value for our investors. we also believe that transparently disclosing the goals and relevant metrics related to our esg programs will allow our stakeholders to be informed about our progress.
the topics covered in this section are informed by an internal esg materiality assessment completed in fiscal 2020, which assessed both the impact on our business and the importance to our stakeholders, as well as by relevant topics identified through third-party esg reporting frameworks, standards and metrics, such as the sustainability accounting standards board ("sasb"), and the task force on climate-related financial disclosures ("tcfd"). more information on our key esg programs, goals and commitments, and key metrics can be found on our website in our annual stakeholder impact report.
our esg highlights as of the fiscal year ended january 31, 2021 include the following:
covid-19 response. in fiscal 2021 we mobilized to support our employees, our customers and our communities in response to the covid-19 pandemic in a number of ways.
•protecting our workforce. in an effort to protect the safety and well-being of our employees, we closed our offices around the world and provided an allowance for employees to use for equipment to improve their ability to work from home. we provided regular communication and updates to employees, including through company-wide video calls led by senior management, with participation of board members and guest experts in psychology and other medical fields throughout fiscal 2021. additionally, we expanded our leave programs to include accommodations for child or elder care hardships during the pandemic.
•innovation and customer support. to support our customers, we launched work.com, which includes new solutions designed to help our customers reopen safely. we also launched work.com for schools to help schools reopen safely and vaccine cloud to help governments and healthcare organizations more safely and efficiently manage vaccine programs at scale.
•supporting our communities. in fiscal 2021, we took action to help address the personal protective equipment ("ppe") shortage facing medical personnel by sourcing millions of units of ppe for doctors, nurses and first responders in the united states and other countries.
data security. customers entrust us with their most sensitive data, and they expect us to protect it using security risk management practices and advanced systems that respond to the changing security landscape and emerging threats. we have made and will continue to make substantial investments in our cybersecurity programs. we provide an overview of our program, training, best practices for our customers, and information on system status, security issues, and compliance certificates on our website at www.trust.salesforce.com.
data privacy. our customers trust us to help them build meaningful relationships with their own customers. the privacy of the data that we are entrusted to protect is a top priority. our customer agreements and our privacy policies (which are publicly available on our website) describe how we safeguard data with an effective privacy and security program. we also offer resources to help our customers operate globally in compliance with privacy laws such as general data protection regulation and the california consumer privacy act.
equality. we invest in programs designed to enhance employee success and create a safe, healthy and engaging working environment that fosters our core value of equality for all. refer to our "human capital management" section in item 1 of part i for details.
racial equality and justice task force. in fiscal 2021 we launched our racial equality and justice task force to help drive systemic change in our workplace and community. to create the task force, we invited employees from across the business, as well as leaders of our black employee resource group, to help guide our vision, which includes our focus on the four pillars of "people, purchasing, philanthropy and policy." our vision and goals have been formalized in a new racial equality and justice v2mom, which is an internal management tool that incorporates our vision, values, methods, obstacles and measures.
ethical and humane use. we recognize the transformative power of technologies and the importance of ensuring their ethical and humane use. core to this effort is our office of ethical and humane use of technology, which works across product, law, policy and ethics to develop and implement strategic frameworks across the company for the responsible design, development and use of salesforce technologies. we regularly engage with stakeholders and experts in the field to further this effort. we also rely on our ethical use advisory council, composed of diverse frontline and executive employees, as well as external academics, industry experts and society leaders, to navigate how we mitigate risk and avoid harmful unintended consequences.
civic engagement. we work with policymakers and elected officials around the globe on issues that matter to our stakeholders, including our employees, our customers, our stockholders, our communities and the environment. salesforce is nonpartisan in our work, and we support candidates and eligible organizations of any party who share our priorities, align with our core values, represent and engage with significant numbers of our employees and demonstrate leadership. we are committed to complying with all laws, rules and regulations relevant to our political activity and we publicly disclose all contributions in the u.s. in reports filed with the federal election commission and with various state campaign finance commissions. our governance committee provides independent oversight and annually reviews our political contributions. management prepares a detailed annual report of our corporate political spending, which is publicly accessible at https://www.salesforce.com/company/public-policy/.
supporting our communities. giving back is foundational to our corporate culture and our core value of equality. in the fiscal year ended january 31, 2021, together with the salesforce foundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, our social value contribution include the following:
•approximately $1.4 billion in donated or discounted products provided to non-profits and higher education institutions via salesforce.org. we calculate the social value of products sold or donated based on the estimated price we would have received if a comparable product was sold to a for-profit business of similar size and location, less the price that we received, if any, for the same product from a qualified non-profit educational institution or other non-government organization ("ngo"). when a comparable salesforce product price was not readily available, we used a ratio based on the weighted average of the salesforce price to a for-profit company compared to the salesforce price to a non-profit company.
•approximately $100 million in grants and donations to qualified non-profits, educational institutions or other ngos in fiscal 2021.

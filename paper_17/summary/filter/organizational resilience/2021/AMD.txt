Our operations rely critically on the proper functioning and security of our information technology assets and information systems, and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business processes and internal controls. We maintain sensitive data on our IT assets—including intellectual property and confidential business information relating to our customers, partners, workers and consumers—and the confidentiality, integrity and timely access to that data is central to our reputation and competitive position. We have been increasingly subject to cyber‐attacks, hacking, phishing and other security incidents, and outages, data loss, data breaches or unauthorized access could compromise our intellectual property or sensitive information, incur significant remediation costs, disrupt product development and key business operations, expose us to liability and adverse publicity, and damage customer relationships. The increased prevalence of work-from-home arrangements at AMD and our providers has introduced additional operational and cybersecurity risks to our more distributed IT environment, making it more difficult to maintain visibility, control and administrative scalability, and if our security controls cannot keep pace with these changes or with evolving regulatory and compliance requirements, our business would be materially adversely affected. We anticipate ongoing and increasing costs for enhancing and implementing information security controls, training personnel, investigating and remediating breaches, defending related litigation and complying with regulations such as the GDPR and CCPA. We outsource portions of our supply‐chain logistics, product distribution, transportation management and information technology support services to third parties, and our ability to deliver the right products on time depends on maintaining robust IT governance, systems capability and process automation across multiple internal and external platforms. Our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is also dependent upon third-party intellectual property and software and hardware development and testing tools, and any incompatibility between our products and industry-standard software or hardware could materially adversely affect our business.

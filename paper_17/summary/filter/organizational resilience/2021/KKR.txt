Extended periods of remote working by our employees could strain our technology resources and introduce operational risks, including heightened cybersecurity risk. We rely heavily on our financial, accounting and other data processing systems and on third-party systems for critical functions, and our business is highly dependent on information systems and technology to process and evaluate transactions globally in a time-sensitive, efficient and accurate manner. Our information systems and technology, including related security systems, may be unable to accommodate our growth or new business needs, and any failure to timely implement necessary software or system upgrades—for example, to transition away from libor to alternative reference rates—could adversely affect our operations. We depend on an increasingly concentrated group of external vendors for hosting solutions and technologies, and a disaster or disruption in the technology that supports our businesses or the electronic communications with our counterparties could have a material adverse impact. Cybersecurity failures and data security breaches in our computer systems and networks—or in those of third-party service providers—could jeopardize confidential information, cause interruptions or malfunctions, and result in significant losses, liability to clients and reputational damage.

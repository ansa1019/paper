Visa describes itself as a global payments technology company whose advanced transaction-processing network, VisaNet, enables the authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions for consumers, merchants, financial institutions and other participants and supports a broad portfolio of digital solutions and infrastructure investments—ranging from tokenization, push payments and non-card payment flows such as Visa B2B Connect to mobile, in-app and e-commerce channels and emerging blockchain, distributed ledger, cryptocurrency and biometric authentication technologies. The company acknowledges that innovations in payment technology have not only opened new product and service offerings but also expanded regulatory oversight over governance, licensing, cybersecurity, processing infrastructure and localized risk-management requirements, and it warns that failure to anticipate, adapt to or integrate new technologies in a timely manner could undermine its competitive position, product value, intellectual-property rights and future growth. Visa further recognizes that it must collaborate closely with clients, fintechs, merchants, platform providers and network partners to develop, deploy and secure these technologies, and it cautions that disruptions, failures or breaches of its own or third-party systems—whether from cyber-attacks, hardware, software or network failures, supply-chain disruptions or severe weather events—could significantly impair its operations, harm its reputation and brand, trigger regulatory action or litigation, and challenge its ability to recover critical business functions under its continuity plans.

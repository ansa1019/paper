We develop infrastructure needed to scale our business, including acquisitions, customer support, e-commerce and IP licensing capabilities, and make substantial technical, financial, compliance, sales and marketing investments that depend on robust information systems. We rely on internal processes and information systems to support key business functions, including SOX-compliant financial reporting, and are implementing a new enterprise resource planning system whose programming quality and controls are critical to our ability to operate efficiently and report accurately. We depend on third-party software development tools to design, simulate and verify new products and on cloud-based infrastructure, encryption and authentication technologies, employee email and other services provided by external suppliers to run critical business systems and data centers, yet we have limited visibility into their security practices. Security breaches, cyber-attacks or supply-chain attacks—whether through malware, social-engineering, ransomware or exploitable defects in third-party software—could disrupt operations, delay order fulfillment, harm customer relationships, reduce revenue, increase expenses, trigger regulatory inquiries or enforcement, and damage our reputation. To mitigate these risks, we must continuously engineer more secure products, enhance system reliability, address identified vulnerabilities promptly, and ensure our suppliers maintain adequate information security measures. We are also subject to complex and evolving data privacy and security obligations under laws such as the GDPR, CCPA/CPRA and various cross-border data transfer regulations, and failure by us or our partners to comply could result in fines, litigation, restrictions on data processing or orders to destroy data, any of which could materially harm our business.

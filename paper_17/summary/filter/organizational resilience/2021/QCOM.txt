The annual report discloses that third parties regularly attempt to gain unauthorized access to the firm’s IT systems, employing increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks—“trying to covertly introduce malware to our computers and networks, including those in our manufacturing operations, and impersonating authorized users”—which could lead to the misappropriation, theft, misuse, disclosure, loss or destruction of proprietary technology, intellectual property or confidential information and may even disrupt manufacturing, assembly or testing operations. The company asserts that it “has a robust cybersecurity program that is aligned to international cybersecurity frameworks, and that we leverage industry best practices across people, processes and technologies in an attempt to mitigate cybersecurity threats,” and it “expects to continue to devote significant resources to the security of our IT systems, and our technology, intellectual property and proprietary and confidential information.” It further warns that third-party providers of software or services used in its IT infrastructure “may be subject to similar attacks, which could also result in malware being introduced into our IT infrastructure… through the third parties’ software updates.” In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company “modified our workforce practices, such as having the vast majority of our employees working from home,” and plans to operate under a “hybrid” working environment offering remote access flexibility while acknowledging that such arrangements “may impair our ability to maintain our collaborative and innovative culture” and “cause disruptions… including decreases in productivity, challenges in communications between on-site and off-site employees and, potentially, employee dissatisfaction and attrition.” Finally, the report describes how the firm “places orders with our suppliers using our and our customers’ forecasts of demand for our products, which are based on a number of assumptions and estimates,” underscoring the coordination of internal planning, asset deployment and interfirm transactions fundamental to its operational and supply-chain capabilities.

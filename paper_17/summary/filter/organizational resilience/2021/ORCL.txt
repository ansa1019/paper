Our annual report emphasizes that information technology capabilities have evolved from standalone software and hardware offerings to comprehensive platforms that coordinate a firm’s assets, internal processes and interfirm transactions in support of business strategies and work processes. We underscore our “ability to develop new products and services, integrate acquired products and services and enhance our existing products and services” as central to transforming Oracle into a competitive force, with frequent “refreshes and releases of our cloud products and services” driven by machine learning, artificial intelligence and rapidly changing IT trends. Our Oracle Cloud strategy, including SaaS and IaaS offerings, depends on anticipating customer needs, increasing data center capacity and optimizing connectivity and infrastructure scalability to meet demand, while managing revenue volatility arising from subscription-based cloud services versus point-in-time license and hardware arrangements. We acknowledge the complexity inherent in our software development, hardware manufacturing and support operations, the critical role of third-party suppliers and open-source components, and the associated risks of “coding, manufacturing or configuration errors” and security vulnerabilities that “could result in service interruptions, delays or outages” and damage information reliability, customer relationships and market-based performance. We further recognize the need for robust information management capability—ensuring data accuracy, timeliness, security, confidentiality and access controls—amidst evolving privacy and security regulations, cyber-attack threats and the integration challenges of acquired technologies, all of which require organizational agility, process optimization, strategic resource allocation and dynamic capabilities to deliver competitive advantage in a global, digital business environment.

The Company’s disclosures reflect a broad and evolving IT capability encompassing substantial investments in technology infrastructure, software development and digital services to coordinate assets, processes and interfirm transactions.  Technology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees engaged in research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design and maintenance of its online stores and curation and display of products, as well as infrastructure costs such as servers, networking equipment, data center depreciation and amortization, rent and utilities that support both internal requirements and external sales through AWS compute, storage, database, analytics and machine learning offerings.  These investments enable process automation, enhanced customer experiences and operational flexibility, including faster delivery, expanded selection and improved reliability, while payment processing and related transaction costs are integrated into variable fulfillment expenses.  The risk factors acknowledge that system interruptions and delays caused by surges in website traffic, constrained labor markets, global supply-chain disruptions or failures of hardware or software upgrades could materially disrupt order acceptance, fulfillment and service delivery, reducing sales, increasing costs and exposing the Company to liability.  The Company also uses third-party encryption, authentication, content-delivery and back-office systems, and its digital content offerings depend on effective digital rights management technology, with any breach or malfunction posing risks of data loss, unauthorized disclosure of confidential, sensitive or proprietary information and regulatory or legal action under privacy, data protection and network security laws.  In response to regulatory, licensing and cybersecurity requirements in jurisdictions such as China and India, the Company tailors technology services through contractual relationships with locally licensed third parties.  Ongoing expansion into new products, services, technologies and geographies subjects the Company to technology challenges that may require write-downs of investments, while system optimization efforts—including process development, fulfillment network and data center optimization, and upgrades to online and network infrastructure—remain critical to sustaining the Company’s competitive advantage and supporting its firm-wide capability to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure IT resources in support of business strategy and work processes.

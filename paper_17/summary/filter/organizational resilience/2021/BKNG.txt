The Company’s disclosures emphasize that its information technology capabilities are pivotal to coordinating assets and internal processes, supporting business strategies, and enabling interfirm transactions, yet are exposed to significant risks and challenges. Management warns that it may not be able to keep up with the rapid pace of technological and market changes—necessitating continual adaptation of services and online platforms to evolving industry standards, devices, and local preferences, development of differentiated mobile apps, and integration of new “connected trip” technologies and cross‐brand ERP and financial systems. The Company highlights its reliance on third‐party IT resources—search and meta‐search platforms (principally Google), GDSs, cloud and hosting providers, affiliate marketing channels, payment processors, and data communications services—any deterioration in whose performance, algorithmic terms, or contractual arrangements could harm traffic, transaction processing, marketing efficiency, and revenues. It also discloses extensive cybersecurity, data privacy, and business continuity concerns, including cyberattacks, ransomware, phishing, account takeovers, system outages, and data localization and regulatory requirements, which could disrupt service availability, impair information accuracy and timeliness, damage its reputation, expose it to liability and regulatory fines, and increase costs. Furthermore, the Company acknowledges investment needs in IT governance, software development, monitoring and evaluation systems, payment innovation, and disaster recovery to maintain operational flexibility, information reliability, and competitive advantage, noting that failures in these IT capabilities could materially impair its growth, customer experience, and financial results.

During periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services, we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems and procedures for training, assimilating and managing our workforce and in appropriately sizing our supply chain infrastructure and facilities on a timely basis, and the variability in our customers’ investments may require our management to adjust spending and other resources allocated to operating activities and to continuously reassess our strategic resource allocation choices in response to the changing business environment. The COVID-19 outbreak and related governmental measures have affected our business and operations by causing facility closures, disrupting production and logistics, requiring modifications to our business processes, the implementation of business continuity plans, the development and qualification of alternative sources of supply, changes to existing manufacturing processes, and teleworking by a large proportion of our workforce, which have caused delays in product shipments and product development, increases in costs, and decreases in revenue, profitability and cash from operations. We must continue to invest in research and development and maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive, and in the face of uncertainty on which technology solutions will become successful, we will need to focus our efforts on developing the technology changes that are ultimately successful in supporting our customer requirements. Certain critical information systems that we rely on for the operation of our business and the products that we sell are susceptible to cybersecurity and other threats or incidents. We maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business, including telecommunications, the internet, our corporate intranet, various computer hardware and software applications (some of which may be integrated into the products that we sell or required in order to provide the services that we offer), network communications and email, and we make use of software-as-a-service products for certain important business functions provided by third parties and hosted on their own or third-party networks and servers. These information systems may be owned and maintained by us, our outsourced providers or third parties such as vendors, contractors, customers and cloud providers, and are subject to disruption, breach or failure from various sources. Although we have implemented ISO 27001-compliant security procedures, virus protection software, intrusion prevention systems, identity and access controls and emergency recovery processes, and we carefully select our third-party providers of information systems to mitigate risks to our technology, data, intellectual property and other sensitive information, those procedures and protection systems cannot be guaranteed to be fail-safe and we may still suffer cybersecurity and other incidents that could result in the loss of confidentiality, security, connectivity and access, disruption of operations and failure of our or our customers’ manufacturing processes, errors in output, exposure to legal claims, reputational damage and other adverse effects.

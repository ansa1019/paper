In managing and scaling our operations, we continue to expand and deploy information technology systems globally—encompassing product data management, procurement, inventory and supply chain management with automation, production planning and execution, sales, service and logistics, dealer management, financial, tax and regulatory compliance and connectivity features such as over-the-air software updates, internet access and supercharger network provisioning—while delivering functional enhancements like next-generation driver-assistance features. These complex infrastructures underscore our IT capability to mobilize and deploy digital resources in support of business strategies and interfirm coordination, yet remain susceptible to external and internal cyber-attacks—including malware, ransomware, denial-of-service and phishing—unauthorized access or exploitation of software defects, system malfunctions, interruptions or power outages, which could result in data breaches, intellectual property theft, operational disruptions, regulatory investigations, litigation and reputational harm. While we maintain information technology measures and rely on service providers to safeguard our networks and products, we acknowledge inherent challenges in monitoring third-party controls and ensuring timely identification and remediation of vulnerabilities. Any failure to successfully implement, maintain or expand these digital infrastructures and controls could disrupt our ability to manage data, inventory, manufacturing, sales, delivery and service processes, impair internal control over financial reporting and compliance and harm our competitive positioning, brand and overall performance.

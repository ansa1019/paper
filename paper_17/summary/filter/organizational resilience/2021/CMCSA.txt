The company’s disclosures emphasize that its ability to acquire, develop, adopt and leverage new and existing technologies is critical to supporting and enhancing its business strategies and work processes, as reflected in ongoing investments in scalable infrastructure, line extensions, customer premises equipment, wireless gateways, X1 and Sky Q set-top boxes, smart televisions using its global technology platform and the Peacock streaming service; its success depends on executing these technology initiatives effectively and choosing equipment that meets consumer expectations in an environment of rapidly evolving 4G, 5G and fiber-based networks and advanced distribution platforms. The company acknowledges reliance on third-party vendors for hardware, software and operational support, including extensive open-source components, applications, data hosting and cloud-based services, and recognizes the importance of mobilizing and deploying these IT-based resources in coordination with other organizational capabilities to deliver data and information with appropriate accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access. Network management systems, customer service operations and programming delivery platforms are critical to operations and are subject to constant threats from cyber attacks, vulnerabilities in security architecture, malicious software and social engineering, requiring ongoing monitoring, updates and significant cybersecurity investment. The company’s technology deployment and digital transformation efforts are intended to improve operational flexibility, customer experience and market responsiveness, but carry risks of cost overruns, reduced revenue or competitive disadvantage if execution is delayed or if competitors adopt superior technologies, while contractual commitments with vendors and ongoing capital expenditures underscore the importance of effective IT governance, resource allocation and strategic decision-making to maintain competitive advantage and support business innovation.

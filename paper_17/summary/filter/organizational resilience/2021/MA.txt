Mastercard’s 2021 Form 10-K describes its IT capabilities as the backbone of its core global payments network and its expanding multi-rail solutions, through which it acquires, deploys, combines and reconfigures technology resources—comprising computer systems, software, networks, data management and human expertise—to support and enhance business strategies and work processes worldwide.  The company operates an integrated suite of digital technologies including automated clearing house transactions, real-time account-based payments, tokenization, contactless and mobile payments, machine learning, AI, cyber and intelligence solutions, and data-services offerings designed to deliver accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access in response to changing business needs.  These disclosures underscore reliance on secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential information across its own and third-party systems and personal mobile devices, the need to adapt IT infrastructure and delivery models to regulatory mandates such as data localization and on-soil hosting, and the pursuit of strategic partnerships with fintechs, digital and technology companies to foster innovation, competitiveness and market agility.  Mastercard further highlights challenges of rapid technological change, intellectual property and standards compliance, onboarding new customer types, remote and hybrid workforce environments, expanding cybersecurity threats—ranging from malware and phishing to state-sponsored attacks—and the establishment of an enterprise resiliency program with enhanced controls, monitoring systems and ongoing IT investment to safeguard operations, support regulatory compliance, sustain operational flexibility and drive organizational transformation.

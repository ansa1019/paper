Technological changes, such as reconfiguration of supply chains, autonomous vehicles, robotics, 3D printing or other technologies, are identified as factors that may affect real estate values and cash flows. Our information technology systems, despite system redundancy, security measures and a disaster recovery plan, remain vulnerable to energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication failures and cyber security attacks, including malware, ransomware or unauthorized access. Any system failure, cyber security attack or third-party security event at vendors, sub-processors and service providers could interrupt operations, disrupt data and services, result in material business disruptions and financial losses and require significant additional costs to remedy. Despite training, detection systems and response procedures, an increase in email attacks (phishing and business email compromise) may create disruption to our business and financial risk. Although security incidents to date have had an insignificant financial impact on our operating results, the growing frequency of attempts may lead to increased costs to protect the company and respond to events, including the engagement of additional personnel, consultants and protection technologies. Any compromise of our security could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, unauthorized access to information of ours and others, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, loss or misuse of information and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business. Remediation costs for security events may not be covered by our insurance.

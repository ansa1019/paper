The Company relies on the efficient, uninterrupted and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate its business and securely process, transmit and store electronic information and to provide the data and analytics used to manage its business, support its work processes and execute strategic initiatives; accordingly, it has embarked on strategic initiatives involving investments in and partnerships with technology companies, technology infrastructure and digital platforms, including mobile devices, cloud services, “open source” software, digital analytics, artificial intelligence, robotics and blockchain, to enhance its IT architecture, enable connectivity and interoperability, mobilize IT‐based resources and integrate these with other organizational resources in support of its growth and competitive positioning. These IT capabilities must be continually maintained, updated, patched and upgraded to protect against a growing volume of software vulnerabilities and evolving cyber‐attack methods—such as advanced persistent threats, supply chain intrusions through third‐party software updates, ransomware, malware, phishing, “deep fakes” and denial‐of‐service attacks—and to manage access controls in a complex vendor and subcontractor environment. The Company’s information management capability must provide data with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality and user access and adapt to changing business directions, while complying with evolving global privacy, data security and data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, Brazil’s LGPD, China’s PIPL and other U.S. state and federal requirements), which impose significant costs, operational requirements and risk of regulatory enforcement, fines and reputational harm. In addition, the integration of acquired businesses’ information systems is complex and exposes the Company to technology deployment and security risks, potential legacy vulnerabilities and liabilities, and may delay realization of expected benefits. Failure to develop and implement improvements in technology or to respond effectively to digital disruption and other technological change could result in operational difficulties, additional costs, business continuity failures, degraded client service, impeded market responsiveness and competitive disadvantage.

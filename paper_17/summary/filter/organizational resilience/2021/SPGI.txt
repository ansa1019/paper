The company’s businesses depend critically on information technology resources and capabilities to support and enhance their core operations, as evidenced by their reliance on secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential data in computer systems and networks of both the enterprise and third-party vendors; the maintenance and continual improvement of global information-technology data centers and other technology initiatives; the integration of a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems in connection with major mergers, acquisitions and divestitures; the provision of multi-asset class data, research and analytical capabilities via market-intelligence desktop products, bulk data feeds and application programming interfaces; the hosting and delivery of proprietary content to users through web-based channels and cloud infrastructure; and the need to deploy improved processes and technology to innovate, design, develop, assemble, test, market and support new products and enhancements in a timely and cost-effective manner. These capabilities underpin critical functions such as ratingsdirect® and ratingsxpress® credit analytics, index-related licensing, commodity price assessments and indices-based data subscription services, and are continually extended through investments in technology infrastructure, cloud services, data management solutions, network systems and monitoring systems to facilitate operational flexibility, process automation and performance gains. At the same time, the company faces the ongoing challenge of safeguarding against cybersecurity threats—ranging from common industry attacks to sophisticated, state-sponsored intrusions—through maintenance of technical and administrative safeguards, vulnerability remediation, business continuity planning for remote work environments, disaster recovery protocols and third-party outsourcing agreements, all of which highlight the firm’s need to mobilize and leverage IT-based resources in combination with organizational capabilities to sustain competitive advantage, ensure information accuracy, reliability, security and connectivity, and support strategic decision-making and business transformation.

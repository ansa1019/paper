The company discloses that cybersecurity events, breaches, disruptions or other incidents relating to its information technology systems or those of its customers, vendors and suppliers may compromise its IT networks; result in corrupt or lost data or the unauthorized release of confidential or proprietary information; disrupt manufacturing and other operations; trigger regulatory inquiries, penalties or claims for damages; and thereby adversely affect its operating results and reputation. It further acknowledges that cybersecurity and other threats to information technology systems are frequent, constantly evolving and difficult to defend against, that breaches of customer information technology systems could disrupt customer operations and depress demand, and that incidents in suppliers’ information technology systems could lead to unauthorized disclosures, constrain access to needed supplies, affect accounts receivable collection or limit access to required technology. The company emphasizes that technology is the foundation of its business and that it makes significant investments in research and development to improve existing technology and products, develop new products to meet changing customer demands and enhance production processes, while noting that such investments are made before commercial viability can be assured and that expected returns may not materialize immediately. It highlights its strategic focus on developing new digital capabilities, including platforms like ti.com, allocating capital to research and development and manufacturing capacity, and investing in semiconductor manufacturing equipment and facilities—such as the 300-millimeter factory in Lehi, Utah—as part of its long-term capacity planning to strengthen its competitive advantages.

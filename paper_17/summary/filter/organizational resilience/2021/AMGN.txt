The company discloses that it “relies on sophisticated information technology systems, including software, mobile applications, cloud services and network-connected control systems,” which are highly integrated into business functions such as research and development, clinical and commercial manufacturing, and product distribution; that as “the majority of our employees are working remotely, our reliance on our and third-party information technology systems has increased substantially”; and that “the complexity and interconnected nature of our systems makes them potentially vulnerable to breakdown or other service interruptions.” It warns that “a breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information technology systems, network-connected control systems and/or our data, interrupt the operation of our business and/or affect our reputation,” noting that “upgrades or changes to our systems or the software that we use may result in the introduction of new cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks,” that “our systems are also subject to frequent cyberattacks,” and that such threats “could include the use of harmful and virulent malware, including ransomware or other denials of service, that can be deployed through various means, including the software supply chain, e-mail, malicious websites and/or the use of social engineering.” The company further describes that “we utilize third-party service providers to process, store, manage or transmit such data,” which “may increase our risk”; that “security breaches of their systems or service outages could adversely affect our security, leave us without access to important systems, products, raw materials, components, services or information or expose our confidential data or sensitive personal information”; and that “no assurances” exist “that our efforts will detect, prevent or fully recover systems or data from all breakdowns, service interruptions, attacks and/or breaches of our systems,” while noting that “our cyber-liability insurance is not sufficient to cover us against all losses” from such events.

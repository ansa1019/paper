The company’s disclosures describe a broad array of information-technology capabilities and dependencies that underpin its coordinated delivery of products and services, including its reliance on internal and external information technology infrastructure, systems and networks—such as video-conferencing, public cloud computing and software-as-a-service platforms—and the continual investments it makes to upgrade, expand and secure those systems in order to support business strategies, work processes and evolving customer needs.  These capabilities encompass data processing and storage services provided by public cloud providers, integrated authentication ecosystems that give customers one identity across multiple offerings, network and communications systems for online tax filing, payroll administration, payments processing, and personal financial management, and the internal systems used for development, marketing, operations, support, sales, accounting and financial reporting.  The registrant warns that security incidents, improper access or disclosure of sensitive or personal data, evolving cybersecurity threats—particularly as the workforce shifts to hybrid remote-office models and increased use of videoconferencing—and vulnerabilities in open source or third-party software components could result in unauthorized data release or system unavailability, with material reputational, legal and financial consequences.  It further recognizes that failures or interruptions in its own systems or those of its third-party vendors—ranging from public cloud service outages to pandemic-related disruptions among service providers or financial institution partners—could prevent delivery of critical services, lead to significant revenue loss, damage to customer confidence and inhibit its ability to innovate and deploy new offerings, particularly during seasonal peaks.  The company also acknowledges that regulatory, legislative or contractual requirements relating to privacy, data localization, security controls and platform distribution terms can affect its technology deployment and resource allocation decisions, potentially increasing costs, slowing our response to market changes and constraining our capacity to leverage IT‐based resources in combination with other organizational capabilities to maintain competitive advantage.

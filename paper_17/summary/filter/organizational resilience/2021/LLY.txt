The Company’s risk disclosures emphasize its reliance on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems, infrastructure, and hardware—both internally and through third‐party service providers—to accumulate, process, store, and transmit large volumes of confidential information, including trade secrets, clinical trial data, strategic plans, marketing and customer information, and personally identifiable information. It acknowledges that maintaining the security, confidentiality, integrity and availability of its IT systems and confidential information is vital to its business and that these systems are vulnerable to system inadequacies, operating failures, service interruptions, security breaches, or malicious intrusions—ranging from harmful malware and exploitation of software vulnerabilities to denial-of-service attacks and social engineering. The Company warns that failure, inadequacy, breach of, or unauthorized access to its IT systems or those of its third-party providers could materially harm its business and reputation; impair its ability to secure and maintain intellectual property rights; interrupt or degrade manufacturing, product or service delivery; damage customer relationships; produce unreliable data in clinical trials; and erode competitive advantages. It further notes the continuously evolving global privacy, data protection, and data security laws to which it is subject, the heightened cyber-attack threats targeting healthcare systems, and the fact that jurisdictions outside the U.S. may present weaker IT system security and additional risks. Although the Company maintains cyber liability insurance and implements measures to protect, detect, respond to, and prevent cyber‐attacks and enhance IT system resiliency, it concedes these measures may not succeed. Lastly, it recognizes that outsourcing arrangements for hosting and supporting its IT systems introduce additional risk if third parties fail to meet legal, regulatory, confidentiality, privacy, security, or performance standards.

The company discloses that it is heavily dependent on its information technology systems, infrastructure and data—including its Kite Konnect platform for maintaining chain of identity and chain of custody for CAR T-cell therapies—and that the multitude and complexity of its computer systems render them inherently vulnerable to service interruptions, malicious intrusion or ransomware attacks. It warns that cybersecurity incidents, such as malware deployment, denial-of-service or social engineering attacks, can result in the exposure of critical or sensitive information—including intellectual property, trade secrets and personal data of employees, patients and business partners—to unauthorized parties or the public, which could give rise to legal liability, regulatory action under evolving data protection and privacy laws (such as GDPR, CCPA and similar statutes) and significant remediation costs. The company further notes that its business and technology partners face comparable risks, that its incident response and cybersecurity protocols may not prevent future breaches or interruptions, and that enhanced regulatory requirements and enforcement could materially increase its cost of providing products and services or even prevent it from offering certain services in jurisdictions where it operates.

The report discloses that, as part of its ongoing effort to upgrade its current information systems, the company periodically implements new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of its business operations and that, as it implements and adds functionality, unforeseen problems could disrupt its ability to provide quotes, take customer orders and otherwise run its business in a timely manner, potentially causing interruptions in service, loss of data or reduced functionality. It further acknowledges reliance on its information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information—including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees, customers and other business partners—and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities (such as interacting with suppliers, selling products and services, fulfilling orders and billing, collecting and making payments, shipping products, providing services and support to customers, tracking customer activity and fulfilling contractual obligations). The company cautions that its systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer hackers, computer viruses, ransomware, phishing, computer denial-of-service attacks, unauthorized access to customer or employee data or company trade secrets and other attempts to harm its systems, and that certain systems are not redundant and its disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality. A significant disruption in or breach of its information technology systems or violation of data privacy laws could materially interrupt operations, delay production and shipments, result in theft of intellectual property, damage customer and business partner relationships and the company’s reputation or give rise to legal claims and regulatory penalties, each of which could adversely affect its business and financial results. As a global organization, the company is subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions, including U.S. state laws regulating data breach and security, the EU General Data Protection Regulation’s stricter requirements for collecting and processing personal data, and laws in certain countries such as China and Russia requiring local server storage and imposing data transfer restrictions. The company also identifies competitive factors such as technological innovation and e-business capabilities and describes strategic growth investments in commercial tools and infrastructure to support cross-selling opportunities, including expansion of geographic sales reach, e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, service and operational infrastructure and research and development projects to enhance the customer experience.

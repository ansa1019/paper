Our disclosures describe a continually evolving information technology capability that underpins the coordination of our assets, processes, interfirm relationships and cloud-based services and that requires the ability to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure technology resources, knowledge, practices, management skills, business process understanding and human resources in support of business strategies and work processes. We devote significant resources to “building, purchasing or leasing datacenters and equipment” and upgrading our “technology and network infrastructure,” maintaining “robust and reliable” connectivity, storage and compute capacity, and engineering “more secure products and services,” enhanced security and reliability features, proactive deployment of software updates, mitigation technologies, digital security infrastructure and tools such as firewalls and anti-virus software. Our strategic vision for cloud and edge services infused with artificial intelligence depends on execution across multiple areas, including “bringing to market compelling cloud-based experiences” that maintain compatibility and performance on diverse devices, “enhancing the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers,” ensuring service reliability and data security, and making our services platform-agnostic. We recognize that “our internal IT environment continues to evolve” as we adopt new devices, social networking and consumer-oriented technologies, and that cyber-threats—including supply-chain attacks such as Solorigate/Nobelium, coordinated denial-of-service attacks, exploitable vulnerabilities and social engineering—require continuous monitoring, detection, prevention and remediation capabilities. We also acknowledge the need to support regulated industries with “enhanced or specialized requirements,” to maintain end-to-end integration across third-party hardware and software ecosystems, and to manage the quality, reliability and security of our IoT solutions, AI algorithms and interconnected devices. This holistic IT capability supports our business innovation, operational efficiency, competitive advantage and ability to transform both internal processes and customer experiences across global markets.

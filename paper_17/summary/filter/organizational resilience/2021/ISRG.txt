The company’s disclosures emphasize that its information technology systems and digital infrastructure constitute critical organizational resources and capabilities essential to the coordination of its assets, internal processes, interfirm transactions and relationships, and must reliably collect, store, process and report data with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access to support operational efficiency, supply-chain and manufacturing operations, financial reporting and customer interfaces. It warns that interruptions to these IT systems, including cybersecurity attacks or breaches, could adversely affect ordering, distribution and manufacturing processes of both the company and its suppliers, create risks to patient safety and product functionality, trigger recalls or field corrective actions and impair its ability to attract and retain customers. The shift to fully remote and hybrid work environments is identified as heightening vulnerability to cyber attacks, increasing operational risk and necessitating investments in encryption, authentication and other security measures. The company relies on external vendors for aspects of its IT capability and recognizes that defects or inadequate security programs in third-party systems may introduce vulnerabilities that could expose failures in internal controls. It maintains programs to detect, contain and respond to security incidents in accordance with industry and regulatory standards but acknowledges that evolving attack techniques, coupled with the complexity of privacy, data protection and information security laws worldwide—including the GDPR, UK GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA/CPRA and various state, federal and foreign regulations—pose ongoing compliance, governance and risk management challenges, any of which could result in significant fines, litigation, reputational harm, reduced market responsiveness and diminished competitive advantage.

ADP’s businesses rely on the collection, hosting, storage, transfer, processing, disclosure, use, security, retention and disposal of large volumes of personal and business information through its payroll, financial, accounting and other data processing systems, and the Company devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly update its information technology systems and controls, including programs and processes to prevent, detect and respond to increasingly sophisticated cyber-security incidents. Hardware, software, applications or services developed internally or procured from third parties must be properly managed—through upgrades, enhancements and expansions—to ensure operational efficiency, scalability and resilience, and ADP hosts client applications in both its own data centers and third-party cloud-computing environments while maintaining disaster recovery, business continuity and crisis management plans. The Company continually invests in its cloud-based human capital management technology solutions—such as its next-gen payroll platform with a policy-based, highly scalable self-service framework, the AI-driven mobile-first Roll product for payroll and tax filing, the ADP DataCloud and Marketplace innovations including a diversity, equity and inclusion analytics dashboard, and the RUN platform’s new user experience and native workforce management solution—to support evolving client needs and preserve competitive advantage, all while navigating stringent privacy, data protection and cybersecurity obligations under GDPR, CCPA/CPRA and related regulations.

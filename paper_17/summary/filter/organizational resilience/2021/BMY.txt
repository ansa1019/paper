Bristol-Myers Squibb relies extensively on information technology systems, networks and services, including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools, physical security systems and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting its business. The Company is in the process of integrating a large number of manufacturing, operational and administrative systems to achieve consistency throughout the combined organization, including with respect to human capital management, portfolio rationalization, finance and accounting systems, sales operations and product distribution, pricing systems and methodologies, cybersecurity systems, compliance programs and internal controls processes. A significant breakdown, invasion, corruption, destruction or interruption of critical information technology systems or infrastructure, by the workforce, others with authorized access to the systems or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations. The ever-increasing use and evolution of technology, including cloud-based computing, creates opportunities for the unintentional dissemination or intentional destruction or modification of confidential information stored in the Company’s, or its third-party providers’, systems, portable media or storage devices. The Company could also experience a business interruption, theft of confidential information or reputational damage from industrial espionage attacks, malware or other cyber-attacks, which may compromise its system infrastructure or lead to data leakage, either internally or at third-party providers. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to progress, the Company has observed an increase in cybersecurity incidents across the industry, predominantly ransomware and social engineering attacks; further, government entities have been the subject of cyber-attacks. As the cyber-threat landscape evolves, these attacks are growing in frequency, sophistication and intensity, and due to the nature of some of these attacks, there is also a risk that they may remain undetected for a period of time. Although the aggregate impact on operations and financial condition has not been material to date, the Company has been the target of cyber-attacks and expects them to continue as cybersecurity threats have been rapidly evolving in sophistication and becoming more prevalent. The Company has invested in industry-appropriate protections and monitoring practices of its data and IT to reduce these risks and continues to monitor its systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats. While it maintains cyber insurance, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of systems. There can be no assurance that continuing efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches to the Company’s or its third-party providers’ databases or systems that could adversely affect the business. The Company also is increasing its use of social media and remote engagement tools to communicate company news and support patient care and healthcare professionals, subject to risks associated with information leakage, improper collection or dissemination of personally identifiable information, negative or inaccurate postings and the potential for unanticipated longer-lasting shifts in interactions that may require the continued adoption of digital engagement models.

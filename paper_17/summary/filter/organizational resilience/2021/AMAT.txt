Applied’s risk disclosures and MD&A repeatedly underscore the critical role of its IT capability in coordinating business processes and supporting strategic objectives, noting its reliance on third-party providers of outsourced software development and IT services, network equipment investments, and unabsorbed information technology costs within corporate functions. The company highlights the material risk of information technology or infrastructure failures and cybersecurity incidents—including those of third-party data hosting or telecommunications providers—and identifies additional data, information and cyber security risks associated with an extensive remote workforce now working full-time. Applied further acknowledges evolving obligations under data privacy, cybersecurity and data localization regulations, as well as customers’ increasing demands for stringent contractual provisions regarding privacy, cybersecurity and confidentiality. To better manage order tracking, supply chain logistics, inventory forecasting, human resource allocation, financial data aggregation and reporting, and organizational alignment, the firm periodically implements new or enhanced enterprise resource planning and related information systems, and warns that delays or difficulties in these implementations could impair productivity, cost efficiencies and business continuity. The accelerated digital transformation driven by the COVID-19 pandemic is described as intensifying demands on IT deployment and resource mobilization to sustain operations, support customer relationships and mitigate disruptions across its global manufacturing, logistics and service activities.

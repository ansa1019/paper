NextEra Energy and its subsidiaries are highly dependent on sensitive and complex information technology systems and network infrastructure whose continuous functioning is required to process and monitor a very large number of highly complex, geographically dispersed transactions and to support critical business functions and regulatory reporting. Despite implementation of security measures, these systems remain vulnerable to failures or unauthorized access from operator error, severe weather, cyber incidents or terrorist acts, and any such failure or breach could compromise sensitive confidential data, interrupt transaction processing, inhibit revenue tracking or collection and materially impair business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, the companies routinely add, modify and replace information systems—a process that is costly and entails risks such as integrating new systems with existing processes, implementing revised accounting procedures and controls, ensuring accurate data conversion and avoiding deficiencies or delays that could divert management and employee resources and undermine the effectiveness of the control environment. The retail businesses’ reliance on access to and sharing of sensitive customer data with vendors and service providers further exposes NextEra Energy and FPL to the risk of reputational harm, diminished customer confidence, identity theft, legal claims and fines in the event of a significant data breach.

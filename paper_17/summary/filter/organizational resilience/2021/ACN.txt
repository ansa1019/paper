Accenture recognizes that its ability to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure IT resources underpins its competitive positioning and support for business strategies, and consequently its services and solutions are continually being adapted and expanded in response to rapid and continuing changes in technology and offerings—particularly in digital, cloud, security, artificial intelligence, automation, blockchain, internet of things and as-a-service solutions—to serve evolving client needs and drive operational efficiency and innovation. The company depends on a global information technology network and systems infrastructure to securely process, transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among its worldwide locations, people, clients, alliance partners and vendors, and as the breadth and complexity of mobile technologies, social media and cloud-based services grows—and with an increasingly remote workforce—the risk of security incidents and cyberattacks correspondingly increases. In providing services and solutions, Accenture often manages, utilizes and stores sensitive or confidential data, including personal information and proprietary business information, and expects these activities to increase through the use of data and analytics, the internet of things and artificial intelligence, which necessitates robust information management capabilities to ensure accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access. The firm’s growth strategy focuses on driving innovation through investments in new technology areas, securing meaningful alliances with emerging technology providers early in their life cycle to develop certified personnel with in-demand technology skills, and aligning its global delivery model to meet client demand for application modernization, cloud enablement and managed security services, while proactively managing talent—hiring, reskilling, retaining and motivating professionals with diverse skills in order to respond quickly to changes in technology, industry and macroeconomic environments and continuously innovate to fulfill client demand. To safeguard its IT capabilities, Accenture maintains policies and procedures for intellectual property protection of its proprietary platforms, software and methodologies and relies on confidentiality, nondisclosure and contractual arrangements, while acknowledging that regulatory compliance, data privacy laws such as GDPR and CCPA, and evolving cyber threats pose material operational, legal and reputational risks that require ongoing governance, investment and oversight to preserve the firm’s competitive advantage and performance excellence.

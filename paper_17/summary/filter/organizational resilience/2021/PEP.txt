In response to evolving consumer and workplace dynamics—accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic and the growth of e-commerce channels—our operations have placed increasing demands on our information technology infrastructure, exposing us to heightened risks of system failure, unavailability and cyber incidents. We rely on public-facing websites, cloud-based services and enterprise-wide systems to support critical activities such as internal communications, consumer interfacing, order management and inventory control, facility operations, financial record-keeping and compliance reporting, and we recognize that cyberattacks, network outages, software or hardware failures, natural disasters or personnel actions can lead to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, data loss and shutdowns of offices, plants or distribution centers. These risks extend to third-party providers, including cloud data and software service partners whose performance and security are integral to our payroll, benefits administration, finance and accounting functions. As part of our multi-year business transformation initiative, we are migrating to new ERP systems and platform solutions globally—an effort that, in some markets such as the United Kingdom, has already resulted in outages and operating inefficiencies—and we continue to allocate resources to build and maintain robust IT architecture, strengthen cyber defenses, deploy monitoring and disaster recovery systems and refine governance processes. Concurrently, shifts in consumer preferences toward digital and direct-to-consumer channels and intensifying competition compel us to evolve our digital marketing capabilities, invest in data analytics and artificial intelligence, and integrate advanced technologies into our supply chain and customer-facing tools to enhance operating efficiencies, agility and responsiveness in a dynamic marketplace.

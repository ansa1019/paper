In discussing risk factors, Adobe notes that “conditions caused by the pandemic has affected the rate of IT spending and may in the future adversely affect our customers’ ability or willingness to purchase our offerings”; that “the process of developing and acquiring new technology products and services and enhancing existing offerings is complex, costly and uncertain”; and that “the desire of organizations to undertake significant evaluation processes to determine their technology requirements prior to making information technology expenditures” can delay sales. The report discloses that “we rely on data centers managed both by Adobe and third parties to host and deliver our services… and any interruptions or delays in these hosted services, or failures in data collection or transmission could expose us to liability and harm our business and reputation” and that “integration of our products and services with one another and other companies’ offerings creates an increasingly complex ecosystem that is partly reliant on third parties.” It highlights that “unauthorized access to or loss or disclosure of data stored by Adobe or our service providers may occur through… breaches of a secure network by an unauthorized party, software vulnerabilities or coding errors,” that “accounts created with weak or recycled passwords could allow cyber-attackers to gain access to employee or customer data,” and that “hardware or software failures or errors in our systems (or those of our third-party service providers) could result in data loss or corruption, cause the information that we collect or maintain to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies, or cause us to fail to meet committed service levels or comply with regulatory notification requirements.” Adobe further warns that “security vulnerabilities in our products and systems, or in our supply chain, could lead to reduced revenue or to liability claims,” that “cyberthreats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex,” and that it “devotes significant resources to address security vulnerabilities through engineering more secure products, enhancing security and reliability features in our products and systems, code hardening, conducting rigorous penetration tests, deploying updates to address security vulnerabilities, regularly reviewing our service providers’ security controls, reviewing and auditing our hosted services against independent security control frameworks (such as ISO 27001, SOC 2 and PCI), providing resources such as mandatory security training for our workforce and improving our incident response time, but security vulnerabilities cannot be totally eliminated.” The company acknowledges the need to “plan infrastructure capacity appropriately and expand it proportionally with the needs of our customer base, as service outages or performance issues could occur if capacity is strained,” and notes that “we are increasingly building AI into many of our offerings,” which “presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business.”

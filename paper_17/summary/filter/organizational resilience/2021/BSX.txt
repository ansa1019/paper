Throughout the pandemic, our global crisis management team implemented business continuity plans, including establishing a medical advisory group for employees, leveraging work-from-home infrastructure to facilitate social distancing and accelerating capabilities to provide remote physician support. We rely on information technology (IT) systems, including technology from third-party vendors, to process, transmit and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations. Similar to other large multi-national companies, the size and complexity of our IT systems makes them vulnerable to cyber-attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy or other significant disruption. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and to develop new systems that keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems, regulatory standards, the increasing need to protect patient and customer information and changing customer patterns. Third parties may attempt to hack into our products to obtain patient data or disrupt performance, and the technologies of third-party vendors upon which we rely may contain defects or vulnerabilities that create further disruptions. We have observed vulnerabilities, such as the Log4j issue reported in December 2021, which could affect our systems and those of our vendors and partners. Any failure to maintain or protect our IT systems, products and data integrity, including from cyber-attacks, intrusions or other breaches, could result in unauthorized access to patient data and personally identifiable information, theft of intellectual property or other misappropriation of assets, compromise of confidential or proprietary information, operational disruptions or, in the worst case, patient harm, and may invite regulatory scrutiny. We also face risks associated with integrating acquired businesses that may have defects or vulnerabilities in their own systems. In the U.S., federal and state privacy and security laws require us to protect medical records and other health information, in Europe the Data Protection Directive and the General Data Protection Regulation impose further requirements and potential fines, and numerous other countries have laws restricting data transfers or localizing data storage. While we believe our compliance meets regulatory expectations and is not material to our business, there is no guarantee we will avoid enforcement actions or civil claims that could increase costs or interrupt our operations. To address these risks, we have established controls and procedures to escalate enterprise-level issues, including cybersecurity matters, to appropriate levels of management and our board of directors, with subject matter experts and a crisis committee analyzing vulnerabilities; matters with potential material financial, operational or reputational impact are immediately reported in accordance with our escalation framework, and our management responsible for disclosure controls is informed promptly of any cybersecurity risks or incidents that may materially affect our operations to facilitate timely public disclosure as appropriate.

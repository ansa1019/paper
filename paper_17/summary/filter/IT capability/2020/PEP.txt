Remote work has increased demand on our information technology infrastructure, exposing us to potential failure, disruption, unavailability and heightened vulnerability to cyberattacks and other incidents. We depend on information systems and technology, including public websites and cloud-based services, for many critical activities—communications within our company, interfacing with customers and consumers, ordering and managing inventory, operating facilities, protecting confidential information and maintaining accurate financial records and regulatory, legal and tax compliance—and if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain this infrastructure or to timely identify and respond to cyber threats, our business can be adversely affected through transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, data loss, legal claims or proceedings, regulatory penalties and customer attrition. Similar risks arise from our reliance on third-party providers, including cloud service vendors, for IT support services and administrative functions. To address rapid shifts in consumer trends, including the surge in e-commerce and digital channels, we are making the necessary investments in our go-to-market systems, digital initiatives, data analytics and direct-to-consumer e-commerce capabilities, reimagining our marketing, enhancing our digital marketing and data analytic skills and developing more powerful digital tools and capabilities for retail customers, while also migrating core systems, such as our financial processing platforms, to enterprise-wide solutions.

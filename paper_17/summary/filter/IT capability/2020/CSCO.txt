The company warns that “the COVID-19 pandemic may also result in long-term changes in customer needs for our products and services in various sectors, along with IT-related capital spending reductions, or shifts in spending focus, that could materially adversely affect us if we are unable to adjust our product and service offerings to match customer needs,” and that “the recent shift to a remote working environment also creates challenges … impact[ing] our ability to enhance, develop and support existing products and services.”  It highlights the growing threat of “cyber-attacks, data breaches or malware” against its own operations and those of its customers, noting that such events on “our customers’ networks, or in cloud-based services provided by or enabled by us, could result in claims of liability against us,” and that “vulnerabilities and critical security defects, prioritization decisions regarding remedying vulnerabilities or security defects … could result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business.”  The firm describes how it “has been transforming our business to move from selling individual products and services to selling products and services integrated into architectures and solutions” and how “we continue to make changes to how we are organized and how we build and deliver our technology, including changes in our business models with customers.”  It asserts that “we are integrating intent-based technologies across networking, security, collaboration, applications and the cloud” “to help our customers manage more users, devices and things connecting to their networks” and “to provide customers with a highly secure, intelligent platform for their digital business.”  The 10-K cautions that “failure to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs” could impair its “strategic initiatives and investments,” and notes that in response to the pandemic it “introduced a variety of free offers and trials for our Webex and security technologies as they dramatically shifted entire workforces to be remote” and “announced a Cisco Capital business resiliency program leveraging currently available funds to provide organizations with access to financing solutions” to enable digital transformations.

We rely extensively on information technology systems, networks and services—including Internet sites, data‐hosting and processing facilities and tools, physical security systems and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted, provided or used by third parties—to support our research, development, manufacturing, commercialization, marketing, selling, human resources, finance and other business‐unit and functional services, and we are in the process of integrating these systems—alongside human capital management, portfolio rationalization, finance and accounting systems, sales operations and product distribution, pricing systems and methodologies, cybersecurity systems, compliance programs and internal controls—across the combined Bristol-Myers Squibb and Celgene operations; a significant breakdown, invasion, corruption, destruction or interruption of this critical information technology infrastructure, whether by our workforce, others with authorized access to our systems or unauthorized persons, could negatively impact our operations, lead to data leakage or unintentional dissemination or intentional destruction of confidential information, and expose us to industrial espionage, cyber-attacks such as phishing, social engineering or malware, business interruptions, theft of confidential information or reputational damage, particularly given the ever-increasing use and evolution of cloud-based computing and other digital technologies; although we have invested in industry-appropriate protections, monitoring practices, and cyber insurance to reduce these risks and continue to monitor our systems on an ongoing basis, no assurance can be given that we or our third-party providers will avoid future cybersecurity breaches or data leakage that could adversely affect our business.

The company discloses that it faces “it systems-related failures or security breaches and data privacy risks and obligations” that “could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations,” and that “we may not be able to keep up with rapid technological or other market changes.” It warns that “the implementation of new information technology, payment, enterprise resource planning (ERP) or other systems could be disruptive and/or costly or we may experience difficulty successfully integrating new systems into existing systems or migrating to new systems from existing systems, any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.” Under “Information Security, Cybersecurity and Data Privacy Risks” it states that “our processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data exposes us to risks of internal or external security breaches” and that despite “existing technical, administrative and physical security measures” a breach “could result in severe damage to our information technology infrastructure,” “lost business,” “harm to our brand or reputation,” “consumer complaints and other adverse consequences” or regulatory penalties. It notes a “heightened risk of security breaches” due to global operations and that “we expend significant resources to protect against security breaches, and regularly increase our security-related expenditures to maintain or increase our systems’ security.” The report further cautions that “if our systems cannot be expanded to cope with increased demand or fail to perform, we could experience unanticipated disruptions in service, slower response times, decreased customer service and customer satisfaction and delays in the introduction of new services,” and acknowledges that its “computer hardware for operating our services is currently located at hosting facilities around the world” and is “vulnerable to damage or interruption” from a variety of events. In its management’s discussion and analysis, it separately classifies “information technology expenses” as consisting primarily of “software license and system maintenance fees; outsourced data center and cloud computing costs; payments to contractors; and data communications and other expenses associated with operating our services,” noting an increase driven by “cyber security and data privacy software” and elevated outsourced data center costs. The company also highlights regulatory challenges such as evolving “cookie” laws that may require “opt-in” consent and thereby affect its ability to tailor and optimize platform performance. Overall, these disclosures underscore the firm’s recognition of the importance of mobilizing and deploying its IT-based resources—including systems deployment, security, data management, capacity planning and integration—to support its global operations and maintain competitive advantage.

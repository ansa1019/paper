Digital technologies have and may continue to increase in their applicability and importance to various aspects of our business, operating and competitive environments, R&D pipeline and product portfolio, and we believe we will need to develop new and enhanced digital capabilities and competences in order to remain competitive. We rely on information technology systems, including technology from third‐party vendors, to process, transmit and store electronic information in our day‐to‐day operations, and our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards, the increasing need to protect patient and customer information and changing customer patterns. Any failure by us to maintain or protect our information technology systems, products and data integrity, including from cyber‐attacks, intrusions or other breaches, could result in the unauthorized access to patient data and personally identifiable information, theft of intellectual property or other misappropriation of assets, or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations, or, in the worst case, could result in harm to patients. We also grow our company through acquisitions and may face risks associated with defects and vulnerabilities in their systems as we work to integrate the acquisitions into our information technology system. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have successfully implemented business continuity plans including establishing a medical advisory group for employees, leveraging work-from-home infrastructure to facilitate social distancing, limiting sales visits to critical cases and accelerating capabilities to provide remote physician support.

The report acknowledges that the company’s business depends on robust networks and information systems—including the internet, cloud‐hosted services and digital devices—to support procurement, supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing, payment collection, human‐resources processes, digital marketing and consumer‐facing applications, and warns that system shutdowns, service disruptions, cybersecurity incidents or breaches could materially disrupt operations, cause unauthorized disclosure of confidential or regulated data, expose the company to legal claims and reputational damage, and require substantial financial outlays to remediate or replace affected systems. To address these risks, the company continuously invests in cybersecurity personnel, technologies, cyber insurance and training, maintains an information risk management program whose emerging‐risk reports are reviewed by senior management and the audit committee, and relies on third‐party IT service providers—such as cloud data storage and digital‐commerce platforms—while recognizing that limited control over these partners’ governance, security and compliance practices increases the company’s operational and reputational risk if they fail to meet contractual commitments. The company further highlights its obligations under evolving personal data protection and privacy laws and cautions that non-compliance could trigger adverse publicity, government enforcement actions and private litigation. In response to rapid shifts in consumer shopping patterns toward mobile applications, e-commerce websites and digital channels, the company is digitizing the Coca-Cola System by deploying data analytics, artificial intelligence, automation and robotics to increase efficiency and productivity, by creating personalized experiences and digital tools for retail partners, and by building e-commerce capabilities, while noting that failure to successfully implement these digital transformation initiatives could adversely affect its share of sales, volume growth, cost reduction objectives and overall financial performance.

We maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business, including telecommunications, the internet, our corporate intranet, computer hardware and software applications (some integrated into our products or services), network communications, email, and software-as-a-service products provided and hosted by third parties or cloud providers, all of which support modifications to business processes, teleworking, alternative sourcing, and business continuity plans. These systems, whether owned internally or by outsourced providers, underpin our operational efficiency, connectivity, data accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, and access, yet they remain susceptible to disruption, breach or failure from unauthorized actions, phishing schemes, malware, denial-of-service attacks, inadequate code, power failures or physical damage to IT resources. Although we have implemented ISO 27001-compliant security procedures, virus protection, intrusion prevention systems, identity and access controls and emergency recovery processes, and carefully select third-party providers to mitigate risks to our technology, data, intellectual property and sensitive information, these measures cannot be guaranteed fail-safe. We acknowledge that recruiting and retaining employees with substantial cybersecurity acumen may be difficult, and that our policies and procedures may not always enable us to timely identify, respond to and remediate threats or incidents, which could impair our or our customers’ manufacturing processes, disrupt our products, services and operations, compromise confidential or sensitive information, expose us to regulatory or legal obligations and reputational damage, and adversely affect our business. Furthermore, disruptions of our IT resources in our manufacturing facilities—due to natural or man-made disasters, widespread illness outbreaks, terrorist activities, political unrest, utility interruptions or other events beyond our control—could delay production and shipments, harm customer trust and negatively impact our operating results.

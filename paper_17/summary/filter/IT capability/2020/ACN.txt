The company discloses that it is dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely process, transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among its locations around the world and with its people, clients, alliance partners and vendors, and that as the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure continues to grow—including through increasing reliance on mobile technologies, social media, cloud-based services and a shift to remote work during the pandemic, which enabled approximately 95% of its workforce to work from home—the risk of security incidents and cyberattacks increases and maintaining effective security measures and protocols becomes more challenging; it further notes that in providing services and solutions to clients it often manages, utilizes and stores sensitive or confidential data, including personal data and proprietary information, and expects these activities to increase—among other things through the use of artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things and analytics—while remaining subject to evolving laws and regulations such as the European Union’s GDPR and the California Consumer Privacy Act; the company states that its success depends in part on its ability to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and offerings—citing digital-, cloud- and security-related offerings and developments in areas such as artificial intelligence, augmented reality, automation, blockchain, IoT, quantum and edge computing and as-a-service solutions—and that it continues to experience growing demand to assist clients with operating and maintaining digital-related services, transforming operations for greater effectiveness and cost efficiency and enabling cloud adoption; it also highlights that a very significant portion of its revenue and services are based on technology or software provided by a few major alliance partners and that it must anticipate and respond to continuous changes in technology and develop alliances with new providers of relevant technology to remain competitive in digital transformations, cloud migrations and security services.

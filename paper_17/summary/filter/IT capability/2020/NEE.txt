Nee and FPL operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continuous functioning of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure and are highly dependent on sensitive and complex IT systems, the failure or breach of which could compromise critical business functions and materially adversely affect their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.  Their operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events within, or wholly or partially outside of, their control, such as operator error, severe weather, terrorist activities or cyber incidents, and any such failure or disabling event could materially adversely affect their ability to process transactions and provide services.  Due to the size, scope, complexity and geographical reach of their business, the development and maintenance of information technology systems to keep track of and process information is critical and challenging, and nee and FPL add, modify and replace information systems on a regular basis.  Modifying existing information systems or implementing new or replacement information systems is costly and involves risks, including integrating the modified, new or replacement system with existing systems and processes, implementing associated changes in accounting procedures and controls, and ensuring that data conversion is accurate and consistent; any disruptions or deficiencies could result in increased costs, the inability to track or collect revenues, diversion of management’s and employees’ attention and resources, negative impacts on the effectiveness of the companies’ control environment and/or the companies’ ability to timely file required regulatory reports.  Their retail businesses require access to sensitive customer data and may need to provide such data to vendors and service providers, and if a significant breach occurred, customer confidence could be diminished, confidential data could be compromised or subject to identity theft, and Nee and FPL could incur costs, fines and legal claims, suffer reputational damage and experience material adverse effects on their business.  In addition, terrorist acts, cyberattacks or other disruptive activities could directly target or materially adversely affect Nee’s and FPL’s information technology systems—limiting their ability to generate, purchase or transmit power, natural gas or other commodities; to bill customers and collect and process payments; and to develop, construct or improve generation, distribution and transmission facilities—which could result in material revenue decreases, significant additional costs, fines and penalties, reputational harm and constraints on their operations and ability to raise capital.

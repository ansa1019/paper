Mastercard’s 2020 Form 10-K describes a continually evolving information technology capability that underpins its position as a competitive force in global payments, from its proprietary core network and real-time account-based payment platform to its supporting infrastructure for secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential transaction and consumer data across its systems and those of third-party providers. The company emphasizes its information management capability—delivering data and analytics with appropriate accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and tailored access—and its deployment of privacy-by-design and data-by-design principles in product development to meet changing business needs. Mastercard warns that rapid technological change in areas such as contactless and mobile payments, e-commerce, blockchain, central bank digital currencies, tokenization and strong authentication, along with intellectual property constraints and local data residency or “on-soil” hosting mandates, could inhibit its ability to adopt new technologies, reconfigure its IT architecture or integrate emerging platforms and thereby undermine its operational flexibility, market responsiveness and innovation. The company also highlights the critical need to mitigate information security incidents, account data compromise events and service disruptions—through ongoing investment in cyber-security, monitoring systems, process optimization and resource allocation—to preserve network resilience, protect against vulnerabilities in customer and third-party environments, and maintain organizational effectiveness and customer trust.

The Company discloses that it relies on information technology to operate efficiently, interface with customers, maintain financial accuracy and efficiency, and accurately produce its financial statements, and emphasizes that failing to allocate and effectively manage resources necessary to build and sustain proper technology infrastructure could expose it to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, loss of customers, business disruptions, or loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breaches. It warns that if data management systems do not effectively collect, store, process, and report relevant data for business planning, forecasting, execution, and regulatory compliance, its ability to plan, forecast, and execute its business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations may be impaired, potentially materially and adversely affecting financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the timeliness of reporting. The Company requires user names and passwords to access its IT systems and uses encryption and authentication technologies to secure data transmission and storage, but acknowledges that such security measures may be compromised by unauthorized persons, employee error, malfeasance, or other irregularities, which could lead to unauthorized access to data or accounts, product functionality issues posing patient safety risks, product recalls, and reputational harm. It notes reliance on external vendors to supply and support aspects of its IT systems introduces additional security risks, and despite significant resources devoted to network security, data encryption, and industry-standard measures, absolute security cannot be guaranteed and undetected vulnerabilities could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service, litigation, liability, and material adverse impacts. The Company further highlights that its business is subject to complex and evolving global privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity laws and regulations—such as the EU’s GDPR, U.S. CCPA and CPRA, and Israel’s privacy laws—that impose stringent requirements on the collection, storage, use, processing, and transfer of personal and business data; non-compliance may result in significant fines, private rights of action, regulatory investigations, and reputational damage, and could restrict its ability to transfer data across borders and offer products and services. In addition, the Company participates in the Medical Device Single Audit Program to demonstrate compliance with multiple jurisdictions’ quality system regulations, including U.S. FDA QSR and ISO standards, reflecting its IT governance, quality management, and post-market surveillance obligations.

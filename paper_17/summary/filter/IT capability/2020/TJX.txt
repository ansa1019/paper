The company discloses that its operations critically depend on its information technology systems, which collect and process information of customers, associates, suppliers and third parties and support key business functions—including planning; purchasing; point-of-sale processing; e-commerce; supply chain and inventory management; human resources; financial management; communications; information security; and legal and regulatory compliance—and that it must accurately anticipate and fulfill current and future IT needs by developing, implementing and maintaining appropriate systems and disaster recovery plans, as ongoing operations and growth depend on the integrity, security and consistent operation of these systems and back-up systems. It acknowledges that its own and its suppliers’ and service providers’ IT systems are targeted by increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks—malware, ransomware, phishing, social engineering, denial-of-service attacks, system vulnerability exploits, skimming, account takeovers and other forms of unauthorized access—and may be damaged or disrupted by power outages, system failures, catastrophic events or employee error, risks heightened by changes in the business landscape and increased remote working, prompting the implementation of additional mitigation strategies and investments across its IT security workforce, technologies and processes. It further notes that the global regulatory environment for information security and privacy is increasingly demanding and that any unauthorized access or system disruption could lead to regulatory enforcement actions, litigation, contract liability, material reputational harm and reduced customer and partner willingness to transact, and that while policies, procedures and controls are in place to manage such risks, they cannot fully eliminate the possibility of data security compromises or IT failures and may be circumvented. The company warns that ongoing efforts to update, enhance or replace systems and infrastructure carry risks of data capture failures, implementation delays, diversion of internal resources and unachieved benefits, and that its substantial size and scale make it challenging to implement IT systems, controls and information sharing consistently across its multiple banners, stores, distribution centers and e-commerce sites. It also describes its use of digital and traditional marketing channels—digital/social media, email, mobile and direct mail—and concedes it may not effectively develop or implement strategies for rapidly evolving digital communication channels. Finally, it reports that marmaxx and homegoods have launched or plan to launch online shopping at www.tjmaxx.com, www.marshalls.com and www.homegoods.com, with e-commerce representing approximately 3% of marmaxx net sales and 5% of tjx international net sales in fiscal 2021, and that capital expenditures include investments in buying and merchandising systems and other information systems to support its infrastructure, distribution centers and growth initiatives.

The company acknowledges that breaches, disruptions or other incidents relating to its information technology systems or the systems of its customers, vendors and other third parties—whether caused by computer viruses, system failures, restricted network access, unauthorized access, terrorism, employee malfeasance or human error—could compromise its information technology networks, result in corrupt or lost data or the unauthorized release of its, its customers’ or its suppliers’ confidential or proprietary information, disrupt manufacturing and other operations, cause the release of personal data or give rise to increased protection and remediation costs, regulatory inquiries or damage claims that could adversely affect its operating results and reputation; it further observes that cybersecurity threats are frequent and constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of defending against them, and that a breach of its suppliers’ information technology systems could likewise lead to release of confidential or proprietary information. In response to the uncertainty associated with events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and potential disruptions to communications and information technology networks across its global operations, the company has long maintained a business continuity plan and has invested in building inventory, expanding its globally owned manufacturing footprint and pursuing strategic, business and organizational changes—including acquisitions, divestitures and restructuring—to enhance operational flexibility, support its objectives and strengthen its ability to acquire, deploy and reconfigure technology-based resources in support of its business strategies and work processes. Moreover, the firm makes significant research and development investments to improve existing technology and products, develop new products to meet changing customer demands and improve production processes, and recognizes that its ability to access needed goods and services may be adversely affected by disputes or disruptions in suppliers’ operations, including disruptions in their information technology systems, which could hinder its resource deployment, supply chain management and overall responsiveness.

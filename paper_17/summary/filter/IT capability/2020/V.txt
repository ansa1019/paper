Visa is a global payments technology company that facilitates digital payments across a global network of consumers, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, strategic partners and government entities through innovative technologies and an advanced transaction processing network (VisaNet) that supports authorization, clearing, settlement and a wide range of value-added services. The global payments industry is undergoing rapid technological change—including mobile and proximity and in-app payment technologies, e-commerce, tokenization, cryptocurrencies, distributed ledger and blockchain technologies, and new authentication technologies such as biometrics, 3D Secure 2.0 and dynamic CVV2—and we expect services and technologies such as our cross-border B2B Connect offering to continue to emerge and evolve. We work closely with third parties, including potential competitors, to develop and access these technologies, but because it is difficult to predict which innovations will be widely adopted or how they may be regulated—and because some may be subject to intellectual property claims—failure to anticipate, adapt to or keep pace with these new technologies could harm our ability to compete, decrease the value of our products and services, impact our intellectual property or licensing rights and impair future growth. Our cybersecurity and processing systems—and those of our financial institution clients, merchants and third-party service providers—have in limited instances experienced errors, interruptions or damage from hardware, software and network failures, cyber-attacks, malware, design or usage errors, catastrophic events, natural disasters or other effects of climate change, and our visibility in the payments industry places us at elevated risk of malicious attacks, including nation-state sponsored intrusions, which have resulted and may continue to result in fraudulent activity and financial losses to our clients. Evolving cybersecurity threats—advanced persistent attacks, phishing and social engineering schemes on internet applications—could compromise the confidentiality, availability and integrity of data in our systems or third-party platforms, and mitigation efforts that depend on third parties or legacy systems may fail to patch vulnerabilities, prevent data exfiltration or meet contractual security standards. Although we devote significant resources to cybersecurity and supplier risk-management programs and have implemented measures to protect our systems and data and to prevent, detect and respond to incidents, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful; such events could disrupt operations, harm clients and consumers, damage our brand, prompt litigation, regulatory scrutiny, fines or penalties, reduce product acceptance and transaction volumes, impair revenues and growth prospects and be costly and difficult to remedy, and in the event of disruptions we may be unable to recover all critical business functions, assets and data through our business continuity program, while insurance coverage may not fully cover losses or claims. The data security, cybersecurity and operational resilience posture of our acquired businesses or partners may also prove inadequate. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, we modified business practices by restricting employee travel, closing offices, moving employees to remote work through digital collaboration and connectivity solutions and canceling physical participation in meetings and events, while network availability and reliability have been tested by potential outbreaks at our data centers or those of issuers, acquirers or merchants, and increased cyber-fraud risks and third-party outages at network providers, call centers and suppliers have underscored our dependence on resilient IT infrastructure. We also face risks of disintermediation and competitive challenges from emerging mobile, e-commerce, peer-to-peer, real-time and faster payment initiatives, alternative payment credentials, domestic networks and domestic real-time payment systems, crypto-currency and stablecoin-based payments, and bilateral agreements that bypass our network, and regulatory initiatives such as PSD2, IFR, FedNow or PIX may require us to open network access to additional participants or reduce barriers to competitor entry, while new or revised industry standards for online checkout, cloud-based payments, tokenization and other payments-related technologies set by ISO, ANSI, W3C, the European Card Standards Group, PCI SSC, NEXO and EMVCo may impose additional costs and constrain the functionality and competitiveness of our IT-driven products and services.

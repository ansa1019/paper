Applied emphasizes the criticality of its information systems capability, noting that “failure to successfully implement enterprise resource planning and related information systems improvements, or delays or difficulties in implementing these systems” could prevent it from realizing anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies and “could result in interruptions in service and operational difficulties, such as its ability to track orders, timely manufacture and ship products, project inventory requirements, effectively manage its supply chain and allocate human resources, aggregate financial data and report operating results, and otherwise effectively manage its business,” thereby risking “quality issues, reputational harm, lost market and revenue opportunities.” The company discloses that the shift to extensive remote work has introduced “additional data, information and cyber security risks associated with an extensive workforce now working remotely full-time,” and identifies “service interruptions from utilities, transportation, data hosting or telecommunications providers, or other events beyond our control” and “information technology or infrastructure failures, including those of a third party supplier or service provider,” as potential supply chain disruptions. It acknowledges exposure to “cybersecurity threats and incidents ranging from employee error or misuse to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats,” any of which could cause “business disruption; the misappropriation of intellectual property, and corruption or loss of confidential information and critical data; reputational damage; litigation with third parties; diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering; data privacy issues; and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs.” The risk factors further note dependence on “third party providers of outsourced functions, including certain engineering, software development, manufacturing, information technology and other activities,” underscoring the need to “provide data and information to users with the appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access” and to “mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with, and leverage the value of, other resources and capabilities” in support of its global operations, supply chain resilience and strategic decision-making processes.

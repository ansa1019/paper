Our disclosures emphasize that our businesses are highly dependent on the continuous operation, enhancement and integration of our operational systems and infrastructure to process and monitor large volumes of complex electronic transactions across diverse markets, clients and locations; any failure in our systems or those of third parties—whether arising from human error, system defects, malfeasance or other misconduct—could impair liquidity, disrupt operations, expose confidential information and damage our reputation. We further recognize that protecting our computer systems, networks and data, and that of our clients and third‐party service providers, against cyberattacks, malware and other security threats is essential to our ability to conduct business, and that enhancements and updates to support business growth, regulatory changes and new business integrations necessitate substantial investment in systemic controls, training and vendor management while creating additional implementation and resilience challenges. We rely increasingly on computing devices, telephony and cloud technologies to support our employees and our clients’ platforms, and, notwithstanding their benefits, these technologies introduce vulnerabilities—including inherent technological defects, system failures and cyber risks—that must be continuously monitored, mitigated and updated. In addition, we are monitoring nascent innovations such as distributed ledger and related digital infrastructure, acknowledging potential legal, operational and security risks as the applications and industry standards evolve and as we facilitate client activities in these areas.

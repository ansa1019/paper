The company discloses that it relies on information technology systems throughout the enterprise to keep financial records and customer data, process orders, manage inventory, coordinate shipments, maintain confidential and proprietary information, assist in semiconductor engineering and operate critical functions such as internet connectivity, network communications and email; it warns that these systems may be susceptible to power outages, hardware failures, telecommunications disruptions, employee malfeasance, user errors, third-party cloud provider interruptions or other unforeseen events, and that a prolonged disruption could result in lost sales, incremental costs and reputational harm. It further notes that the Covid-19 pandemic has led it to modify business practices—including restricting employee travel, shifting work locations and cancelling physical meetings—which increases its reliance on remote connectivity and thus poses additional data security risks. The company also acknowledges that it provides confidential and proprietary information to strategic partners and depends on third-party service providers, and that its security measures or those of its partners may not detect or prevent security breaches, viruses, hacking, sabotage or other failures, any of which could lead to misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data and significant financial or reputational damage. Finally, it observes that integration of a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems in connection with its proposed merger will require extensive coordination of IT architecture and controls, while compliance requirements such as the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification impose further governance and oversight obligations on its IT capability.

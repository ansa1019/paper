AMD’s disclosures emphasize that its ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources is critical to coordinating the firm’s assets, internal processes and interfirm transactions and relationships, noting that its business is dependent upon the proper functioning of its internal business processes and information systems and that modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt its business, processes and internal controls. The Company reports that it relies upon a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key business functions and that the efficient operation of these processes and systems is critical to its business. Management acknowledges that its information systems will continually evolve and adapt to meet business needs—changes that may be costly and disruptive and impose substantial demands on management time—and that as its IT environment evolves through mobility and cloud-based data sharing, it can promote business efficiency but also result in a more distributed IT environment that challenges visibility, control, scalability and administrative requirements. AMD warns that its information technology systems, and those of third-party providers or partners, are vulnerable to damage or disruption from catastrophic events, power anomalies, natural disasters, viruses, malware, cyber-attacks, data breaches and network failures and stresses that IT outages, data loss, data breaches and cyber-attacks could compromise its intellectual property and other sensitive information, be costly to remediate and cause significant damage to its business, reputation and operations. In maintaining its IT capability, the Company incurs ongoing and increasing costs to enhance and implement information security controls, upgrade application, computer and network security components, train workers, remediate data security breaches and related litigation, mitigate reputational harm and comply with external regulations such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act. The Company further recognizes that failure to adequately maintain and update its security systems and to prevent unauthorized access could materially adversely affect its operations, competitive position and financial results, and that its products may be subject to security vulnerabilities requiring mitigations that can impact performance and depend on third-party deployment. Finally, AMD discloses reliance on third parties for certain supply-chain logistics functions, including portions of product distribution, transportation management and information technology support services, noting that if these providers fail to fulfill their responsibilities in a timely manner, its operations and the distribution of its products could be materially adversely affected.

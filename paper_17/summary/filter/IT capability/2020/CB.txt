To support its global operations and respond to changing business needs, the company has invested in and depends upon its information technology capability, including the remote‐work functionality that has placed increased demands on its IT systems and reliance on telecommunications and internet infrastructures; its ability to price products, establish reserves, service customers and report financial results “depends significantly on the integrity and availability of the data” within its information systems and those of third‐party service providers; it has implemented administrative and technical controls and negotiated agreements with vendors to protect its information technology assets, but acknowledges that unauthorized access, malware, cyber‐attacks, system failures, employee or third‐party errors and other security events may jeopardize confidential information, interrupt operations, cause data loss or asset loss, and require significant additional resources for remediation; its cybersecurity and data security framework is subject to evolving U.S. federal, state and non‐U.S. regulations (including the NYDFS Cybersecurity Regulation, NAIC model law, the EU’s GDPR, the CCPA/CPRA and Brazil’s LGPD), the complexity and potential inconsistencies of which could increase compliance costs, heighten the risk of regulatory enforcement and fines, and adversely affect business operations; the company uses analytical and predictive modeling techniques and data analytics—including scenarios, stochastic and forecasting models—to inform underwriting, pricing, claims, reserving and catastrophe‐risk decisions and to help maintain competitive advantage, while recognizing that reliance on historical data and model assumptions introduces uncertainty and the potential for material deviations between modeled outputs and actual results; and it maintains contingency plans and infrastructure redundancy to mitigate the operational impact of disruptions to electrical, communications or outsourced services in the communities in which it operates.

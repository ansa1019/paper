The company’s operations and strategic plans rest heavily on its information technology capabilities, as it relies on extensive systems and networks—both its own and those of global suppliers and third-party providers—for the development, maintenance and troubleshooting of wireless and wireline network components, software development services, billing, customer service support and virtual selling solutions; any system, network or infrastructure failure, unauthorized access to confidential data, cyber-attack or other security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of customer and corporate information, disrupt service provisioning, billing and customer retention, and materially impair its reputation, operational efficiency and financial performance. In connection with the Sprint merger, management is evaluating a long-term billing system architecture strategy, operating and maintaining multiple billing platforms until legacy customers are migrated onto existing systems, with interruptions or delays in migration or system integration posing risks to IT effectiveness, information reliability and customer experience. The firm must continually invest in, deploy and reconfigure technology resources—such as spectrum licensing and leasing, backhaul capacity, distributed antenna systems and the build-out of its nationwide 5G network—to support business strategies, enhance network quality, speed and coverage, meet evolving customer demands and maintain competitive positioning, yet faces implementation challenges from equipment changes, supplier constraints, regulatory permitting conditions, spectrum cost and scarcity, and the complexity of integrating acquired assets. As a designated critical infrastructure provider, the company’s information management capability—encompassing data accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access—and its agility in tailoring these capabilities in response to changing market dynamics, regulatory requirements and interfirm relationships are essential to its ability to mobilize and leverage IT-based resources in combination with other organizational assets to achieve operational flexibility, business transformation and sustained competitive advantage.

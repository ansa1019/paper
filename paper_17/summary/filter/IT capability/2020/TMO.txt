The company’s ongoing effort to upgrade its current information systems includes periodic implementation of new enterprise resource planning software and other applications to manage critical business operations, with the recognition that unforeseen problems during implementation or functionality additions could disrupt its ability to provide quotes, process customer orders and otherwise run the business in a timely manner, potentially causing service interruptions, data loss or reduced functionality. The company relies on its information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information—including confidential business information and personally identifiable data—and to support key processes such as supplier interaction, order fulfillment, billing, payments, shipping, customer support, contract performance and broader operational activities. These systems are exposed to risks from natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures and cyber-attacks (including hacking, viruses, ransomware, phishing, denial-of-service attacks and unauthorized access), and certain systems lack redundancy while disaster recovery planning may be insufficient for all eventualities; a significant disruption or breach could result in production and shipment delays, theft of intellectual property, defective products or services, legal and regulatory claims under data privacy laws, reputational harm and increased security and remediation costs. Recognizing e-business capabilities, communication facilitation and technology infrastructure as key competitive factors, the company has made targeted strategic investments in commercial tools and infrastructure, expanded service and operational platforms and e-commerce capabilities to support cross-selling, broaden geographic reach and enhance the customer experience. As a global organization, it is subject to numerous data privacy and security regulations—including GDPR, local data residency mandates and industry-specific controls—which require robust IT governance, controls and approved legal mechanisms for cross-border data transfers to prevent breaches and mitigate potential fines, business interruptions and reputational damage.

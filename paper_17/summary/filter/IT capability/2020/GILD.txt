We are dependent on information technology systems, infrastructure and data, including our Kite Konnect platform, which is critical to maintain chain of identity and chain of custody of Yescarta, and the multitude and complexity of our computer systems make them inherently vulnerable to service interruption or destruction, malicious intrusion and random attack. Data privacy or security breaches by employees or others pose a risk that sensitive data, including our intellectual property or trade secrets or the personal information of our employees, patients, customers or other business partners, may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Cyberattacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, including during the pandemic, and may involve malware, denial-of-service, social engineering or other means to impair service reliability and threaten data confidentiality, integrity and availability. Our business and technology partners face similar risks and any security breach of their systems could adversely affect our security posture. There can be no assurance that our efforts, or the efforts of our partners and vendors, to invest in the protection of information technology infrastructure and data will prevent future service interruptions or identify breaches in our systems, and such interruptions or breaches could cause the loss of critical or sensitive information, including personal information. Regulators globally are also imposing new data privacy and security requirements, including the EUâ€™s General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, which introduce increased obligations and potential fines of up to four percent of worldwide revenue for non-compliance and could greatly increase our cost of providing our products and services or even prevent us from offering certain services in jurisdictions in which we operate.

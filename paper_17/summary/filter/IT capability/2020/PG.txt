The company’s global business services organization provides technology, processes and standard data tools to enable sector business units, enterprise markets and corporate functions to better understand and serve consumers and customers while delivering world-class solutions at low cost and with minimal capital investment. The company relies extensively on information and operational technology (IT/OT) systems, networks and services—including internet and intranet sites, data hosting and processing facilities, hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, physical security systems and related technologies, many of which are provided or managed by third parties—to support all aspects of its business, from ordering and managing materials, converting materials to finished products and shipping products to customers, to marketing and selling products, collecting, transferring, storing and processing customer, consumer, employee, vendor, investor and other stakeholder information and personal data, summarizing and reporting results of operations, managing banking and other cash liquidity systems, hosting and sharing confidential and proprietary research and financial information, collaborating via global online communications, complying with regulatory, legal and tax requirements, providing data security and handling other processes necessary to manage the business. Given this extensive reliance on IT/OT, the company acknowledges that failures or security incidents—including cybersecurity breaches, advanced persistent threats, computer viruses, ransomware, unauthorized access attempts, denial-of-service attacks, phishing, social engineering, hacking or insider-caused disruptions—affecting the company’s or its service providers’ systems, networks, hardware or processes could interrupt product supply, cause operational outages or aberrations, impair data integrity or availability, expose sensitive business or stakeholder information, and result in significant reputational, competitive, operational, financial, legal or regulatory harm. The company further recognizes that periodic upgrades or adoption of new IT/OT systems and technologies carry the risk that such systems may not function properly or may introduce increased cybersecurity vulnerabilities, potentially impeding the ability to order materials, make and ship orders and process payments, and that the costs and operational consequences of responding to and remediating such incidents could be significant and adversely impact results of operations and cash flows.

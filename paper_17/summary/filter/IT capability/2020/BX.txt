Blackstone’s disclosures make clear that the firm’s ability to coordinate its assets, processes and external relationships increasingly depends on its information technology capability, as “our operations are highly dependent on our information systems and technology and we rely heavily on our financial, accounting, communications and other data processing systems,” which have “supported remote work” under the COVID-19 pandemic while creating “operational risks, including heightened cybersecurity risk.” The firm has “become increasingly reliant on third party service providers for certain information systems, technology (including cloud-based services) and the administration of certain funds,” and has implemented “testing, contact-tracing and social distancing,” robust remote-work protocols, and disaster-recovery and business-continuity programs to preserve “information timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access” and to tailor those capabilities “in response to changing business needs and directions.” Blackstone also acknowledges that cyberattacks and security threats—from phishing and social engineering to system compromises of its or its vendors’ cloud-based environments—could “destroy data or disable, degrade or sabotage our systems,” threaten “the secure processing, storage and transmission of information,” and undermine business continuity and confidence in its digital infrastructure, which is subject to evolving global privacy and data-protection regulations such as the EU’s GDPR and California’s CCPA.

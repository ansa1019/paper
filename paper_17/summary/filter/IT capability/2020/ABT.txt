Abbott depends on sophisticated information technology systems and maintains protected personal data subject to regional and local data protection laws, recognizing that the size and complexity of these IT systems—on which it relies for both infrastructure and products—make them susceptible to cyber attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, or loss of data privacy that could materially disrupt manufacturing, product functionality, customer relations, revenue and invoke legal or regulatory penalties. The company invests in its systems and technology and in the protection of its products and data to reduce the risk of attack or other significant disruption, monitors those systems on an ongoing basis for current or potential threats and for changes in technology and the regulatory environment, and implements business continuity plans that enabled the majority of office-based work to be conducted remotely and strict travel restrictions during the pandemic, followed by rotational office attendance as governmental orders evolved. Capital expenditures include significant investments in information technology, laboratory instruments embedded with data analytics, informatics solutions to help optimize diagnostics laboratory performance and automation solutions to increase efficiency, all of which underscore Abbott’s focus on mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with other capabilities to support business strategies, enhance operational flexibility and transform the firm into a competitive force. Abbott also acknowledges that breaches of protected personal information or disruptions involving its systems or those of third-party IT providers could have a material adverse effect on its business.

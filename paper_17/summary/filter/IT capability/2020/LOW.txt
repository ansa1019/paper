The company warns that its ability to execute its omni-channel sales and marketing presence “requires delivering the capabilities required to execute on them,” noting that its customer-facing technology systems “must appeal to our customers, function as designed and provide a consistent customer experience.” It emphasizes that providing an omni-channel experience hinges on “investing in, maintaining and making ongoing improvements of our existing management information systems” supporting key operations such as sales, inventory replenishment, merchandise ordering and fulfillment, and that failure to “properly maintain, improve, upgrade and expand those systems” or to attract “a large number of skilled professionals, including technology professionals” could impede its strategic initiatives. The report describes rapid IT-led responses to evolving customer behavior, including rolling out curbside pickup, launching mobile check-in and an internal order-picking app to improve associates’ speed and accuracy, deploying touchless buy-online-pickup-in-store lockers, enhancing its mobile app with geofencing technology and re-platforming lowes.com to the cloud to “greatly improve site stability and functionality,” and introducing a new Pro customer relationship management tool to “manage, grow and retain our pro customers” through data-driven actions. The company also highlights risks to its management information systems from “viruses, malicious attacks, telecommunications failures” and cyber-attacks such as distributed denial of service or ransomware, the need to comply with evolving “data privacy and cybersecurity laws,” and dependencies on third-party service providers for authentication, content delivery, back-office support and payment processing under stringent security standards.

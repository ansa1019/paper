In 2020 some customers, particularly in industries most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic—including transportation, hospitality, retail and energy—reduced their IT spending or delayed their digital transformation initiatives, which curtailed customer demand and delayed collections; in response we temporarily closed most of our offices, encouraged employees to work remotely, shifted customer, industry, analyst, investor and employee events to virtual-only experiences, and expect the pandemic will have a long-term effect on remote working and how we innovate. We primarily deliver our software via the internet as a service through a simple and easy-to-use interface so that we can rapidly deploy our packaged offerings and customers can easily build their custom applications, generating subscription-based revenues from digital workflow products such as the Now Platform, IT Service Management, IT Business Management, DevOps, IT Asset Management, Security Operations, Governance, Risk and Compliance, Customer Service Management and App Engine and from IT Operations Management products priced on a per-node basis; as digital transformation accelerates across the enterprise, capabilities such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotic process automation, low-code application development, database scalability, consumer-grade user experiences, collaboration, Internet-connected devices, security, cryptography, internal software development operations and application-and-service awareness become increasingly relevant to customers’ evolving needs. To compete effectively, we must identify and innovate in the right emerging technologies; accurately predict our customers’ changing business needs, priorities and adoption practices; invest in and continually optimize our own technology platform so that it continues to meet the very high performance expectations of our customers; successfully deliver new, scalable platform and database technologies and products; efficiently integrate with other technologies within our customers’ digital environments; and effectively deliver, directly or through our partner ecosystem, business process planning, IT systems architecture planning and product implementation services. We have made substantial investments in data centers, cloud computing infrastructure, sales, marketing, partnership arrangements, personnel and facilities as we enter and expand in new geographic markets, and to support public sector customers we obtained FedRAMP High and DoD IL-4 provisional authorities to operate. Our cost of subscription revenues includes data center capacity costs, colocation, interconnectivity and depreciation of infrastructure hardware equipment, and our research and development expenses include data center capacity and infrastructure used solely for innovation; we may experience increased cyberattacks and security challenges as our global employee base and vendors work remotely on less secure systems, and disruptions in the hardware supply chain could impact our data center operations. To support customers navigating the COVID-19 pandemic and the safe reopening of workplaces, we released emergency response applications, a suite of four safe workplace applications and dashboard. Our professional services organization provides strategic advisory, implementation and consulting services to accelerate platform adoption and drive customer outcomes, and we defer and amortize sales commissions on new, expansion and renewal contracts over an estimated period of benefit.

AbbVie discloses in its risk factors that it depends on sophisticated software applications and complex information technology systems to operate its business and that any failure of those systems—whether from malicious intrusion, random attack, data privacy or security breaches, disruption, degradation or breakdown—could cause critical business operations to fail or sensitive data (including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information of AbbVie, its patients, customers or business partners) to be exposed to unauthorized parties, potentially resulting in loss of revenue, legal, financial or reputational harm and substantial remediation costs; although AbbVie has invested in protecting its data and information technology and monitors its systems on an ongoing basis, it cautions there can be no assurance these efforts will prevent material breakdowns or breaches that could materially and adversely affect its operations.

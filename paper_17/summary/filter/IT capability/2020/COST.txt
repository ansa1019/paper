Availability and performance of our information technology (IT) systems are vital for efficient daily operations, as we utilize these systems to process very high volumes of transactions, conduct payment transactions, track and value our inventory, produce critical decision-support reports, and enable our e-commerce and omnichannel retailing; failure to execute complex IT projects or to maintain uninterrupted system availability and security in the face of power outages, system failures, computer viruses, internal or external security breaches or catastrophic events could materially disrupt procurement, manufacturing, distribution and sales, undermine our competitive position and impair our financial condition. We are undertaking large-scale technology and IT transformation projects and making significant investments in enhancing digital resiliency—through fortification of business-critical systems, data centers and backup infrastructure—to prevent and recover from disruptive events, and any delays or failures in these initiatives could weaken our operational flexibility and competitive advantage. Our e-commerce business depends heavily on third-party logistics providers and the timely development and improvement of our websites and mobile applications to meet evolving member expectations, and reliance on third parties for payment transaction processing services subjects us to potential operational interruptions. We collect, store and process sensitive information relating to our members, suppliers and employees, and while our cybersecurity and compliance controls seek to mitigate risks, the expansion of remote work infrastructure and the increasing frequency and sophistication of cyber threats may expose undetected vulnerabilities, which could result in reputational damage, litigation, government enforcement actions, penalties, unauthorized data disclosure or corruption, diminution in the value of our IT investments, increased remediation costs and loss of member confidence, thereby adversely affecting our organizational performance and market competitiveness.

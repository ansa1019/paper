The Company’s disclosures reflect that its competitiveness and growth depend heavily on its evolving technology‐based resources and capabilities, including its ability to enhance current products and services and to develop innovative offerings in response to constant and rapid technological change, frequent new product introductions and rising client expectations; its capacity to anticipate and respond to evolving industry standards such as tokenization, safety, fraud prevention and security technologies; and its ongoing investments in information security and controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of sensitive business and consumer data.  The reliability, continuity and performance of hardware, software, data, networks and hosted systems are critical to service delivery and business continuity, and any operational failures, software defects, development delays or installation difficulties could materially disrupt services, damage client relationships and impede firm performance.  The Company’s enterprise priorities underscore its focus on digital commerce services, cloud‐based point of sale platforms, mobile payment solutions and digital banking channels, all of which require robust information management capabilities to provide accurate, timely, reliable, secure and tailored data and information in alignment with shifting business needs.  Its growth strategy includes acquisition and integration of software vendors and technology providers—such as bypass mobile’s enterprise POS systems, inlet’s secure digital invoicing platform and Ondot’s digital experience solutions—to expand its digital infrastructure, enable seamless omnichannel customer experiences and leverage synergies across technology portfolios.  Regulatory and market trends, including enhanced cybersecurity and data privacy obligations under GDPR, Schrems II, the New York Shield Act and proposed federal privacy legislation, as well as heightened expectations for cyber risk governance, incident response and resilience, further drive the need for disciplined IT governance, process optimization, resource allocation and system enhancements.  The Company’s shift from in‐house technology to outsourced, scale-based processing and digital channels reflects its dynamic capability to mobilize, deploy and integrate IT resources with other organizational assets in support of business strategies, operational flexibility and sustainable competitive advantage.

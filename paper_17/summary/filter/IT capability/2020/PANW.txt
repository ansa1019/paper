Management highlights that effective coordination of the firm’s assets, internal processes and external transactions increasingly depends on robust IT capability, requiring continuous improvement of information technology and financial infrastructure, operating and administrative systems and controls to manage headcount, capital and processes efficiently, especially under the March 2020 transition to remote work. During fiscal 2020 the company reprioritized engineering and R&D efforts in response to shifting customer demands, expanded cloud hosting infrastructure to scale its subscription offerings, and deployed virtual and containerized firewall appliances and its Prisma cloud-native security platform to support virtualization, cloud computing and software-defined networks. To support growth in subscription and support services, investments in cloud compute, automation and skilled personnel rose significantly, underscoring the mobilization of IT resources in combination with other capabilities. The firm also broadened its global sales and customer support organizations, leveraging IT systems for order processing, forecasting, supply chain management and 24×7 support, while monitoring deferred revenue, billings and cash flow metrics to align IT investments with strategic business decisions. In risk disclosures, the need for resilient IT functionality to maintain operational flexibility, prevent disruptions due to supply-chain delays or cybersecurity incidents, and secure interfirm transactions is emphasized as critical to sustaining competitive advantage and business transformation.

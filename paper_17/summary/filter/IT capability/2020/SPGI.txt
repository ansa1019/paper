In response to maintaining a remote work environment, a portion of our information technology resources has been diverted to establishing and maintaining an infrastructure that supports a sustained remote working environment, which limits the resources available for improvement and innovation projects.  Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential, sensitive and other types of data and information in our computer systems and networks and those of our third-party vendors, and we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update our systems and processes designed to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to the enterprise and our customers, clients and employees, although there is no assurance that all of our security measures will provide absolute security.  We experience cyber attacks of varying degrees on a regular basis and have noted an increase in cyber threats targeted at our remote work environment; breaches of our or our vendors’ systems and networks—from cyber attacks, hacking, malware, employee error or malfeasance—may cause material interruptions or malfunctions in our or such vendors’ websites, applications or data processing or may compromise the confidentiality and integrity of material information regarding us, our business or our customers.  Our ability to deliver our products and services electronically may be impaired due to infrastructure or network failures, malicious or defective software, human error, natural disasters, service outages at third-party internet providers or increased government regulation, and delays in our ability to deliver our products and services electronically may harm our reputation and result in the loss of customers.  We also rely on the business infrastructure and systems of third parties to whom we outsource the maintenance and development of operational and technological functionality, including third-party cloud infrastructure, and such providers may fail to perform, may not maintain adequate physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect the security of our confidential information and data, or could experience system breakdowns, outages or other adverse conditions resulting in disruption to our business.  We regularly assess and take steps to improve our existing business continuity plans and key management succession; however, a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas, whether natural or man-made, could materially interrupt our business operations.  In addition, the rapid change of technology is a key feature of all of the markets in which we operate, and to succeed in the future we must deploy improved processes and technology to innovate, design, develop, assemble, test, market and support new products and enhancements to our existing products in a timely and cost-effective manner, which calls for the implementation of new and improved processes and technologies requiring related change management efforts.

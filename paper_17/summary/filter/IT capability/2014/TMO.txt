The company’s strategic focus on developing and commercializing its own technologies and augmenting internal growth through strategic acquisitions, including the February 2014 acquisition and integration of Life Technologies into its life sciences solutions segment, reflects its efforts to acquire, combine and deploy technology resources in support of business strategies and work processes. Productivity improvements and enhanced operational flexibility are attributed to its practical process improvement (PPI) business system, global sourcing initiatives, facility consolidations and low-cost region manufacturing, illustrating process optimization and resource-deployment capabilities. The company’s revenue recognition policies for software underscore its information management capability, as software license agreements comprising multiple products and services are recognized under the residual method only when vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value exists for undelivered elements, software maintenance and support contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis over their term, and training and consulting services are recognized as performed. In determining the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets, including technology-based assets, the company applies significant judgment through projections of future cash flows discounted to present value and evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or upon indicators of potential impairment, emphasizing its competence in information processing, forecasting and decision-making. Finally, the company’s planned adoption of new revenue recognition guidance providing a single comprehensive model for contracts with customers and expanded disclosures, together with guidance simplifying income statement classification, underscores evolving governance contexts and the need for adaptable information systems to support accurate, timely and transparent financial reporting.

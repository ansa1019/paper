Union Pacific’s disclosures underscore that the management relies on information technology in all aspects of its business and allocates capital to “acquire new technology” and to “develop or implement new technology such as PTC or the latest version of our transportation control systems” to avoid competitive disadvantages and support business strategies. The company recognizes that information technology systems comprising computer hardware, software, and communications equipment are critical to operational efficiency and safety and that “a cyber attack or other event” impairing these systems could cause significant service interruption, safety failures, security breaches, or other operational difficulties with material adverse effects on results. To address this and improve network performance and safety, Union Pacific’s 2015 capital plan allocates “approximately $450 million for PTC,” and the railroad continues to “utilize technology, risk assessment, quality control, training and employee engagement” and targeted capital investments as part of its multi-faceted approach to safety, deploying new technologies and improved transportation plans to enhance operations at yards and other facilities. The company also records expenses for computer software and communications under other expenses, reflecting ongoing investments in technology infrastructure and system upgrades essential for the coordination of assets, internal processes, and interfirm transactions and relationships.

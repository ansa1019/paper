The report describes Cisco’s evolution from a product-centric vendor into a strategic partner “connecting people, process, data and things” by leveraging its information technology capabilities to coordinate internal assets, processes and interfirm relationships and to support business transformation. It highlights the introduction of the Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) as a “next-generation enterprise data center platform architected to unite computing, network, storage access and virtualization resources in a single system,” and emphasizes the firm’s focus on “programmable, flexible and virtual networks,” the Internet of Everything market transition and plans to “architect the Cisco Intercloud solution” to enable “increased use of the network as the platform for all forms of communications and IT.” Resource realignment “into key growth areas, such as data center virtualization, software, security, and cloud,” combined with long-term investments in engineering, sales, service and marketing, demonstrates how the company mobilizes IT-based resources alongside other capabilities to foster innovation, agility and competitive advantage. The company also underscores the need to “develop and introduce new products into existing and emerging markets” to address “rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, new business models such as XaaS” and competitive threats from commoditized “white box” hardware, while noting that interoperability requirements drive joint ventures and strategic alliances. Operational flexibility and capability leverage are further illustrated by supply-chain agreements that permit contract manufacturers and suppliers to procure inventory based on company-defined criteria, with options to cancel or adjust requirements. Finally, the risk factors discussion points to fluctuations in IT-related capital spending, the “complex and uncertain” nature of developing new technologies such as software-defined networking and IoE, and the importance of effective IT governance, resource allocation and strategic management practices in sustaining organizational performance and market responsiveness.

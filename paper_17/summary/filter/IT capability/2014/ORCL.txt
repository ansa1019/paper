Any general weakening of, and related declining corporate confidence in, the global economy or the curtailment in government or corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce or eliminate their information technology (IT) budgets and spending, which could cause customers to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services or cause customers not to pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services.  Our cloud computing strategy, including our Oracle Cloud software-as-a-service, platform-as-a-service and infrastructure-as-a-service offerings, may not be successful, and if we do not successfully execute our cloud computing strategy or anticipate the cloud computing needs of our customers, our reputation as a cloud services provider could be harmed and our revenues and profitability could decline.  Our cloud offerings are generally purchased by customers on a subscription basis and revenues from these offerings are generally recognized ratably over the term of the subscriptions; we incur expenses associated with the infrastructures and marketing of our cloud offerings in advance of our ability to recognize the revenues associated with these offerings.  Rapid technological advances and evolving standards in computer hardware and software development and communications infrastructure, changing and increasingly sophisticated customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements characterize the industries in which we compete, and if we are unable to develop new or sufficiently differentiated products and services, enhance and improve our products and support services in a timely manner or position and price our products and services to meet demand, customers may not purchase or subscribe for our software, hardware or cloud offerings or renew software or hardware support contracts.  We have continued to refresh and release new offerings of our software and hardware products and services, including our database in-memory, Oracle Cloud and Oracle Engineered Systems offerings, and in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 invested $5.2 billion, $4.9 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively, in research and development to enhance our existing portfolio of products and services and to develop new products and services.  If our security measures for our software, hardware, services or Oracle Cloud offerings are compromised and as a result our data, our customers’ data or our IT systems are accessed improperly, made unavailable or improperly modified, our products and services may be perceived as vulnerable, our brand and reputation could be damaged, the IT services we provide to our customers could be disrupted and customers may stop using our products and services, all of which could reduce our revenue and earnings, increase our expenses and expose us to legal claims and regulatory actions.  These risks will increase as we continue to grow our cloud offerings and store and process increasingly large amounts of our customers’ confidential information and data and host or manage parts of our customers’ businesses in cloud-based IT environments, especially in customer sectors involving particularly sensitive data.  We are in the information technology business, and our products and services, including our Oracle Cloud offerings, store, retrieve, manipulate and manage our customers’ information and data as well as our own; we have a reputation for secure and reliable product offerings and related services and we have invested a great deal of time and resources in protecting the integrity and security of our products, services and the internal and external data that we manage, and we run Oracle’s business operations as well as cloud and other services that we offer to our customers on our products and networks.  We offer customers a broad portfolio of software, cloud and hardware offerings and related services to enable customers to adopt a cloud computing strategy that is right for them and enable their internal IT environments to evolve and transform at whatever pace is most appropriate for them.  Our offerings include Oracle Database and middleware software, application software, cloud infrastructure, hardware systems—including computer server, storage and networking products—and related services that are engineered to work together in the cloud and in the data center and are developed and maintained to be enterprise-grade, reliable, secure and interoperable while offering customers a choice in deployment models that best meet their IT needs.  Cloud computing IT environments, including those offered through our Oracle Cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings, are designed to be attractive and cost-effective options for our customers as we integrate the software and hardware on the customers’ behalf in IT environments that we deploy, support and manage on the customers’ behalf.  We are a leader in the core technologies of cloud computing, including database and middleware software as well as web-based applications, virtualization, clustering, large-scale systems management and related infrastructure, and we have expanded our enterprise-grade cloud computing offerings through continued investments in research and development and through targeted acquisitions in order to broaden our Oracle Cloud offerings.  For example, our Oracle Cloud SaaS offerings, including our sales, marketing, customer service, financials, project management, human capital and talent management cloud solutions, enable us to provide IT functionality that customers can use to manage critical business functions in a rapidly deployable delivery model with lower upfront customer investment.  Certain of our enterprise-grade cloud computing offerings include infrastructure based upon our Oracle Engineered Systems, including our Oracle Exadata Database Machine, Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud and Oracle SuperCluster products, which we designed to combine hardware and software offerings to increase computing performance relative to competitors’ products, creating cost efficiencies, time savings and operational cost advantages for our customers and providing the core infrastructure for our own on-premise IT data centers and those of our customers and for cloud IT environments.  An important element of our corporate strategy is to deliver reliable, secure and scalable products and services that are built upon industry standards and are engineered to work together or independently, regardless of the deployment model selected, and we believe that investments in, and continued innovation with respect to, our software and cloud, hardware and services businesses are the foundation of our long-term strategic plans.  An active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy, enhancing the products and services we can offer, expanding our customer base, providing greater scale to accelerate innovation, growing revenues and earnings and increasing stockholder value.  Our software offerings are substantially built on a standards-based, integrated architecture designed to help customers reduce the cost and complexity of their IT infrastructure and operate on single-server or clustered server configurations for cloud or on-premise IT environments, supporting multiple operating systems, and we enable customers to evolve and transform to substantially any IT environment at whatever pace is most appropriate for them. 74

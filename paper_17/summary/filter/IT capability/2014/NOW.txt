Our 10-K discloses that our capacity to coordinate assets and internal processes is largely driven by facilities, data centers and a trained workforce that require long-term investments and expense commitments, underscoring our firm’s IT capability to acquire and deploy infrastructure resources to support business strategies and work processes.  We emphasize our information management capability through the storage, transmission and processing of our customers’ confidential, proprietary and sensitive data—including personally identifiable information, protected health information and payment card data—while maintaining appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access without varying our service offerings due to content.  Our cloud-based subscription service, delivered via multi-tenant software instances hosted in co-located third-party data centers and supported by our own cloud infrastructure hardware, is designed to define, structure, manage and automate services across the global enterprise.  We continually invest to develop and implement new technologies in our services and infrastructure—such as databases, applications and server optimizations, network and hosting strategies and automation—to meet expanding customer requirements for performance, availability, scalability and mobile access.  We rely on open source and other third-party technologies, which may limit our ability to rapidly effect changes, and we identify cyber-security risks from unauthorized use or disclosure, denial-of-service attacks, hacking, loss or corruption of customer data that could impair our IT governance, operational efficiency and customer confidence.  Our risk factors further describe technology deployment risks—software defects, errors in delivering, configuring or hosting services, equipment failures, interruptions from natural disasters at data centers, and capacity constraints that threaten scalability and performance—that may harm firm performance, market responsiveness and competitive advantage.  Finally, our research and development investments and headcount growth in engineering reflect our commitment to enhance existing services, develop new applications, optimize business processes and integrate technology functionalities to drive organizational transformation, business innovation and strategic resource leverage.

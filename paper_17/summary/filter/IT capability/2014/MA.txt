The report, while not expressly using the term “IT capability,” repeatedly underscores the firm’s dependence on and investment in its global payments network and associated technology resources, including connectivity fees for network access, data processing and telecommunications infrastructure to support authorization, clearing and settlement, and computer and telecommunication systems capacity; it highlights the deployment of digital and mobile channel strategies and remote connectivity solutions—spanning personal smartphones, tablet PCs and other devices—to serve customers and cardholders, and describes the operational necessity of robust, secure processing and transmission systems subject to business continuity planning for technology malfunctions, power outages or telecom disruptions. Further, the company emphasizes its fraud detection products and services, information security program, multi-layered cybersecurity protections, regular vulnerability testing and third-party vendor oversight to guard against increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks, malware and data-breach threats, as well as its compliance with global privacy, data-use and security regulations that require changes to data collection, use, disclosure and security practices. These disclosures, taken together, imply a concerted focus on maintaining and evolving an integrated IT architecture—encompassing hardware, software, network, data management and governance processes—that provides accurate, timely, reliable and confidential information, underpins transaction integrity, supports ongoing innovation such as EMV, tokenization and contactless payments, and enables the coordination and reconfiguration of IT and other resources in service of the firm’s business strategies, internal processes and interfirm relationships.

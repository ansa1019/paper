The report discloses that “we are dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely process, transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients, alliance partners, and vendors,” and that “as the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure continues to grow, including as a result of the use of mobile technologies and social media, the potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks increases,” noting further that our liability insurance “might not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyberattacks and other related breaches.” It warns that “in providing services to clients, we often manage, utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or accenture data, including personal data, and we expect these activities to increase,” which subjects us “to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information,” and that “unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or accenture data…could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients,” while “unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we develop for our clients…could result in negative publicity, significant remediation costs, legal liability, damage to our reputation and government sanctions.” The document recognizes that “our success depends on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and industry developments and offerings by new entrants to serve the evolving needs of our clients,” citing “mobility, cloud-based computing, digital, the processing and analyzing of large amounts of data and SaaS solutions” as “current areas of significant change” that may “materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients” and could “reduce and, over time, replace some of our current business.” It cautions that “new services or technologies offered by competitors or new entrants may make our offerings less differentiated or less competitive,” and in its management discussion and analysis highlights the firm’s global delivery model, which “deploy[s] skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis,” notes growing demand for “emerging technologies, including digital services (digital marketing, analytics and mobility) and cloud computing,” and describes a strategic shift to “provide a greater proportion of systems integration consulting” and “application outsourcing through use of lower-cost resources in our global delivery network,” underscoring ongoing investments in technology resources, processes and organizational capabilities to support client business transformation and operational efficiency.

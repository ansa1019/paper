Lockheed Martin also provides a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistics and information services.  Our main areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information technology, including cyber security.  The Information Systems & Global Solutions (IS & GS) business segment delivers advanced technology systems and expertise, integrated information technology solutions and management services across a broad spectrum of applications for civil, defense, intelligence and other government customers.  Based upon our diverse range of defense, homeland security and information technology products and services, we believe that this makes it less likely that cuts in any specific contract or program will have a long-term effect on our business.  As a U.S. defense contractor, we face cyber threats, insider threats, threats to our information technology infrastructure and unauthorized attempts to gain access to our sensitive information, as well as the potential for business disruptions associated with information technology failures, natural disasters or public health crises.  We routinely experience cyber security threats to our systems and must rely on the safeguards put in place by our customers, suppliers, subcontractors and venture partners, which may increase our exposure to complex, persistent attacks given varying levels of security expertise.  If we are unable to protect sensitive information, our customers or governmental authorities could question the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection processes.  Some cyber technologies we develop under contract, particularly those related to homeland security, may raise potential liabilities related to intellectual property and civil liberties, including privacy concerns, and the costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified.

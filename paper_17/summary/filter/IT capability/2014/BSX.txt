The discussion notes that the successful integration of acquired businesses “requires significant efforts, including the coordination of information technologies, research and development, sales and marketing, operations, manufacturing, quality systems and finance,” highlighting IT’s essential role in mobilizing and deploying resources across functions. It further observes that the Company “relies on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations,” and that these systems “require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards, the increasing need to protect patient and customer information, and changing customer patterns.” Management also warns that “third parties may attempt to hack into our products to obtain data relating to patients with our products or our proprietary information,” and that any failure to safeguard these systems and data integrity “could result in the unauthorized access to patient data and personally identifiable information, theft of intellectual property or other misappropriation of assets, or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations,” with potentially material adverse effects on the business. These disclosures implicitly reflect IT capability as a strategic enabler of coordination, information management, security governance and operational resilience across the firm’s processes and relationships.

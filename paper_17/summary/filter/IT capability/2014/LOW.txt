Lowe’s disclosures reflect substantial investments in information technology capabilities across the organization, including extensive investment in on-line sales, content marketing and information searching technology capabilities to support an omni-channel transformation from a single-channel retailer to a home improvement company offering unified sales, store, online, on-site and contact center fulfillment. The company’s risk management process employs analytics, planning processes and risk mapping tools administered by the chief risk officer to identify and mitigate operational, strategic and cyber-security risks.

Customer-facing technology systems, including Lowe’s websites, affiliated sites, mobile apps and a dedicated pros platform, are central to engagement and require timely delivery, reliability, disaster-recovery planning and compliance with payment card industry data security standards and payment-processing rules. The company highlights the importance of protecting sensitive data, preserving information accuracy and confidentiality, leveraging digital infrastructure and connectivity, and aligning IT resources with business needs to drive efficiencies, cost reductions, sales growth and enhanced customer experiences.

The risk factors section cautions that “if we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology or in the marketplace, or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology are not successful, we could lose clients or have trouble attracting new clients,” reflecting the centrality of IT competence in maintaining competitive advantage. It further notes that its “operations routinely involve receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information,” and that as “threats continue to evolve, we may be required to invest significant additional resources to modify and enhance our information security and controls or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities.” The discussion of operational failures calls out dependencies on “third party networks and systems,” business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities, and sophisticated software and computing systems, warning that software defects, development delays or installation difficulties “could result in interruption of business operations, delay in market acceptance, additional development and remediation costs, diversion of technical and other resources, loss of clients, negative publicity or exposure to liability claims.” In its overview, the company characterizes itself as “a leading global provider of financial services technology,” offering “account processing systems, electronic payments processing products and services, internet and mobile banking systems, and related services” that are “necessary for our clients to operate their businesses and are, therefore, non-discretionary in nature.” The industry trends section highlights the “increased focus on digital channels by both financial institutions and their customers,” notes that growing payment volumes have “increased the data and transaction processing needs of financial institutions,” and anticipates that institutions will “continue to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions, manage information and offer innovative new services” while “moving from in-house technology to outsourced solutions as they seek to remain current on technology changes amidst an evolving marketplace.” This integrated technology and services strategy underscores the importance of scalable infrastructure, operational effectiveness initiatives, and ongoing IT investment to support growth in recurring, transaction-based revenue streams.

The company relies on its information technology environment and certain critical databases, systems and applications to support key product and service offerings and maintains policies, processes and internal controls to ensure IT stability, security and business continuity, yet acknowledges that unanticipated system failures, data corruption or unauthorized access could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition or results of operations; it further relies heavily on network systems and the internet for electronic delivery of substantial quantities of data and services via its websites and computer‐based networks, which customers depend on for capacity, reliability and security, and is exposed to impairment of its electronic delivery systems from infrastructure or network failures, malicious or defective software, human error, natural disasters, service outages at third‐party internet providers or regulatory changes, any of which could harm its reputation, lead to customer loss or compromise its ability to store, handle and secure customer data despite disaster recovery plans and backup facilities that are not always fully redundant; the company is in the process of changing financial processing systems to an enterprise-wide solution and has outsourced certain support functions to third-party providers to leverage specialized capabilities and achieve cost efficiencies, but recognizes that delays or failures in implementing these initiatives or in third-party performance may impede transaction processing accuracy and efficiency, lead to business disruption or processing inefficiencies and affect employee morale; its operations and infrastructure may malfunction or fail due to disruptions in physical or technological infrastructure—whether at its New York City headquarters, other major offices worldwide, or third-party facilities—arising from human error, power loss, telecommunication failures, sabotage, terrorism or other causes, and it lacks full redundancy in smaller locations and non-essential systems, which could impair personnel’s ability to service clients; further, the company is exposed to cybersecurity and confidentiality risks in processing, storing and transmitting confidential, sensitive or other information in its computer systems and those of its vendors, as breaches from hacking, malware, denial-of-service attacks or insider malfeasance may cause interruptions, compromise confidentiality and integrity of material information, and result in reputational harm, customer loss, regulatory actions or financial losses that may not be fully insured against or covered; reflecting its focus on IT capability, the company makes significant investments in information technology data centers and other technology initiatives—though it cannot assure such investments will yield increased revenues—has divested its data center and corporate aircraft in portfolio rationalization efforts and continues to invest in digital capabilities intended to integrate its brands more deeply into customer workflows, enhance competitiveness and create a foundation for new products and revenue streams.

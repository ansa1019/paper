We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, and the provision of service to our customers and the operation of our networks and systems involves the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data; our franchised center locations are similarly reliant on information technology systems to manage their business processes and activities. We disclose that our information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, malicious insiders, telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events, and that hackers, acting individually or in coordinated groups, may also launch distributed denial-of-service attacks or other coordinated attacks that may cause service outages or other interruptions in our business. In addition, breaches in security could expose us, our customers and franchisees, or the individuals affected, to a risk of loss or misuse of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data and could result in disruptions in our operations, the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to our brand and reputation, and litigation and potential liability for the company; we further note that the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently, may be difficult to detect for a long time and often are not recognized until launched against a target, and that the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data or system protection measures could be significant. We cite as an example the August 2014 broad-based malware intrusion targeting retailers and subsequently eradicated at approximately one percent of our franchisees’ locations, and we acknowledge that our efforts to deter, identify, mitigate and/or eliminate any future breaches may not be successful. In our Management’s Discussion and Analysis, we describe the continued deployment of technology improvements, including several facility automation projects and the accelerated deployment of our on-road integrated optimization and navigation system “Orion,” which we expect will increase our network capacity, improve operational efficiency, flexibility and reliability, and form part of initiatives to improve flexibility and capacity in our delivery network, enhance yield management and contain costs across all segments.

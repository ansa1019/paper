The company acknowledges that the growth and complexity of its operations place a significant strain on its information technology and financial infrastructure, operating and administrative systems, and internal processes, noting that it must continue to improve and expand these systems to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner.  It warns that deficiencies, delays, or failures in its systems and processes—including those related to third-party software, enterprise resource planning, order review and processing, manufacturing and logistics systems, and supply chain visibility tools—could disrupt existing customer relationships, limit deployments of its products, increase technical support costs, and impair its ability to accurately forecast revenue, expenses, and earnings or to prevent errors, omissions, or fraud.  The company highlights its use of licensed third-party technology to advance these capabilities and emphasizes the need for effective coordination across its expanding international workforce, rapid integration and training of new employees, and central management of complex deployments, all of which reflect its ongoing efforts to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in support of business strategies, operational efficiency, and enterprise security.

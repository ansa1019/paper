The Company discloses that it relies extensively on information systems—encompassing data centers, hardware, software and applications—to process and record store transactions, enable effective communication, plan and track inventory flow, manage logistics and generate performance and financial reports, and that its efficient operation and successful growth depend on its ability to operate and maintain these systems effectively, to select appropriate internal teams and third-party vendors, and to implement and maintain suitable technologies, controls, hardware, software, applications and disaster recovery capabilities. It further acknowledges that compromises to data security—stemming from threats such as cyber-attacks, malware, security breaches or unauthorized intrusions into its own or third-party systems—could materially harm its reputation, disrupt operations and expose it to liability, and it has instituted an ongoing program to assess and enhance the effectiveness of its information security protocols. The Company explains that it routinely modifies, updates and replaces its systems and infrastructure—by adding new hardware, software and applications; maintaining, updating or replacing legacy programs; converting to global systems; integrating new service providers; and adding cloud-computing technologies to support e-commerce development and acquisitions—and cautions that potential issues in implementing these technology initiatives or in optimizing new system elements could reduce operational efficiency or temporarily divert resources. It also notes that its computer and outsourced systems are subject to interruption or damage from power outages, system failures, design or usage errors, catastrophic events or security breaches, and that failure of these systems to perform as designed, or failure to implement and operate them effectively, could disrupt its business, reduce sales or profitability and harm its ability to compete. Moreover, the Company observes that customers’ expectations regarding engagement through internet-based, digital or mobile channels and social media require ongoing investments and rapid adjustments to its digital communication and e-commerce platforms, and that failure to make the right technology investments at the right time and speed may adversely affect its marketing effectiveness, customer traffic and financial results.

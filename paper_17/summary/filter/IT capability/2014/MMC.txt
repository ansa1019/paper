The company recognizes that strategic initiatives involving “investments in technology systems and infrastructure to support our growth strategy” and the need to “identify the most current technologies and methodologies and integrate them into our service offerings” are critical to remain competitive, requiring deployment of “new platforms and systems” and process redesign to capture efficiencies and support evolving business needs; however, “the age of some of our technology,” together with the expansion of and increased use of mobile devices, online and “cloud”-based services and social media tools by employees, clients and third parties and the speed at which information can be widely distributed, heightens the risk of “improper disclosure or misuse of confidential, personal or proprietary information,” whether due to human error, vendor actions or cyberattacks, and is compounded by a global network of third-party vendors with direct systems access, which may expose the firm to regulatory scrutiny, legal liability, reputational harm and material adverse effects; accordingly, the company “engages in periodic testing and maintains policies, procedures and technical safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of confidential, personal and proprietary information,” along with disaster recovery and business continuity planning covering “computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations,” yet acknowledges that its “policies, procedures and technical safeguards may be insufficient to prevent improper access,” that it “may not be able to fully remediate any discovered deficiencies in a timely manner,” and that “significant costs are involved with maintaining safeguards for our technology infrastructure,” while evolving data privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations impose stringent operational requirements, cross-border transfer restrictions, breach notification obligations and potential penalties, all of which could limit operational flexibility, market responsiveness and the firm’s ability to leverage its IT capability.

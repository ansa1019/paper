The annual report highlights the bank’s critical reliance on comprehensive operational and security infrastructures—including computer systems, networks, data management and backup systems, software platforms and internal processes—to support both its core operations and remote channels such as internet and mobile banking, and it underscores the exposure of these systems, as well as those of third‐party vendors, to failures or breaches arising from human error or malicious cyber attacks, including viruses, distributed denial of service attacks, phishing and unauthorized access from external extremist actors, foreign state actors or other counterparty systems; it further notes the bank’s continuous investment in updating, testing and safeguarding these technologies, the implementation of contingency and resiliency plans, and the monitoring of evolving threats to mitigate potential disruptions to customer service, data integrity, regulatory compliance, reputational standing and financial performance.

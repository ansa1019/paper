We maintain and rely extensively on information technology systems and network infrastructures for the effective operation of our business and recognize that any disruption, infiltration or failure of those systems or any of our data centers—whether from software or hardware malfunctions, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, employee misuse, power outages, natural disasters or other events—could result in breaches of data security, loss of critical data, liability under private and governmental laws and significant operational interruptions. We also face evolving risks and compliance challenges from the increasing use of social media platforms by patients and third parties, which may lead to unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information or the spread of inaccurate or negative content and could trigger reporting obligations or regulatory enforcement actions. In addition, we are subject to HIPAA and other federal and state regulations governing the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and failure to comply with these requirements could expose us to civil and criminal penalties, contractual liability and damage to our reputation.

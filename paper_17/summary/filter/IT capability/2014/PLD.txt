In connection with our 2011 merger, we incurred significant transaction, integration and transitional costs in 2012 related to the integration of systems, and we have since maintained system redundancy, security measures and a disaster recovery plan for our internal information technology systems; nevertheless, these systems remain vulnerable to interruptions or damages from events such as energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication failures and cyber-security attacks, including computer viruses or unauthorized access, and any such system failure or accident could materially disrupt our operations, result in additional remediation costs and legal or regulatory violations, lead to unauthorized access to our or third-party information, expose us to significant financial and reputational harm and diminish confidence in our security measures.

System security and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations, reduce our expected revenue and increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation; data security breaches may also result from non-technical means, such as actions by an employee with access to our systems, and actual or perceived lapses in our security measures or the accidental loss or unapproved dissemination of proprietary or sensitive data about us or our partners, customers or third parties could expose us to litigation, liability and reputational harm. For portions of our IT infrastructure, including business management and communication software products, we rely on products and services provided by third parties, and such dependence may result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers, which could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other critical functions. We also rely on sophisticated, technologically advanced third-party software development tools to assist in the design, simulation and verification of new products and enhancements and have experienced delays in product introductions and lost design wins when available tools have been unable to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products, risking market share and revenue declines. In parallel, we continue to deploy advanced IT architectures and digital technologies—such as NVIDIA Grid on the VMware Horizon DaaS platform for cloud-based 3D graphics virtualization and Tesla GPUs with NVLink high-speed interconnect in supercomputing environments—to enhance our digital infrastructure, support business and cloud operations, and leverage IT-based resources in combination with other organizational capabilities.

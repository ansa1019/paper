We rely heavily on our financial, accounting, communications and other data‐processing systems, which may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of tampering or a breach of our network security systems, including cyberattacks, computer viruses and other threats intended to obtain unauthorized access to our proprietary information, destroy data or degrade or sabotage our systems. We operate in businesses that are highly dependent on information systems and technology, and our information systems and technology may not continue to be able to accommodate our growth, while the cost of maintaining such systems may increase from current levels, any of which could materially and adversely affect our operations. Breaches of our network security systems could lead to financial loss, business disruption, liability to our investment funds, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. We depend on our New York City headquarters and the supporting infrastructure, including electronic communications and services provided by us or third parties, for the continued operation of our business, and a disaster or disruption affecting that infrastructure could materially impair our ability to operate without interruption. Our disaster recovery programs may not be sufficient to mitigate harm from such events, and insurance or other safeguards may only partially reimburse us for any losses. In addition, we rely on third‐party service providers for certain aspects of our business, including information systems and technology and fund administration, and interruptions or deteriorations in the performance of these providers or failures of their systems could impair the quality of the affected funds’ operations and adversely affect our reputation and businesses.

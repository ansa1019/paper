The company’s disclosures emphasize that it relies heavily on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks—some maintained in-house and others outsourced—to support its business processes and financial transactional operations, and that system inadequacies or operating failures from energy or telecommunications disruptions, natural disasters, computer malware, malicious intrusions or other causes could materially harm its business. To address these risks, it has implemented extensive measures to prevent, respond to and minimize the impact of system interruptions. The firm also notes that a great deal of confidential information—including trade secrets, intellectual property, strategic and marketing plans, customer data and personally identifiable information—is stored in its own and third-party systems and networks, and that the loss, theft or unauthorized disclosure of such data could impair intellectual property rights, damage its competitive position, breach regulatory requirements and erode public trust; accordingly, it continues to invest in employee awareness and training, information technology systems, business process enhancements and stricter data protection requirements for third parties to monitor, detect and respond to information security breaches. Finally, the company acknowledges that its reliance on third-party relationships and outsourcing arrangements for selected aspects of product development, manufacturing, commercialization and support for its information technology systems introduces risks that these providers may not meet contractual, regulatory or confidentiality obligations, which could disrupt operations.

The report underscores that the firm’s information systems and supporting technology platforms are fundamental to its global investment, monitoring and capital-markets operations and may not be capable of accommodating future growth or evolving business needs, that the cost of maintaining and scaling those systems could rise materially, and that they remain vulnerable to unauthorized access, theft, computer viruses, malicious code or fraudulent e-mail schemes; it highlights the critical importance of secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other sensitive data, notes the potential for material disruption, financial loss or reputational damage if those systems fail or are breached, and points out the firm’s reliance on third-party service providers for key information systems, technology and data management services, the interruption or deterioration of which could impede the performance of its funds and capital-markets businesses and limit its ability to execute its strategies; the report also observes that portfolio companies depend on robust data processing and security for customer, payment and health information and that certain strategic infrastructure and energy assets may require enhanced security measures and insurance coverage, all of which implicitly underscores the need to acquire, deploy and reconfigure technology resources in concert with other organizational capabilities to support business strategies, protect information reliability, optimize processes and maintain operational flexibility.

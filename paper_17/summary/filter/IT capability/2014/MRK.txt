The company is increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology and infrastructure, and it acknowledges that a significant breakdown, invasion, corruption, destruction or interruption of critical information technology systems or infrastructure, including cloud-based computing, could negatively impact operations. The ever-increasing use and evolution of technology creates opportunities for the unintentional dissemination, intentional destruction or loss of confidential information stored in the company’s systems or in non-encrypted portable media or storage devices. The company could also experience business interruption, theft of confidential information or reputational damage from industrial espionage, malware, other cyber-attacks or insider threat attacks, which may compromise system infrastructure or lead to data leakage, internally or at third-party providers. To mitigate these risks, the company monitors its data, information technology and personnel usage of company systems on an ongoing basis; however, there can be no assurance that such efforts will prevent service interruption or the loss of critical or sensitive information from its or its third-party providers’ databases or systems, any of which could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm. The company depends on third-party service providers for support for its information technology systems, and reliance on such outsourcing arrangements could adversely affect its business. In addition, the inappropriate and/or unauthorized use of social media and other external media vehicles could cause brand damage, information leakage or legal implications from improper collection or dissemination of personally identifiable information, and identifying new points of entry as social media expands presents new challenges. Finally, the company is subject to a significant and evolving number of privacy and data protection laws and regulations globally and has adopted a comprehensive global privacy program to manage these emerging risks.

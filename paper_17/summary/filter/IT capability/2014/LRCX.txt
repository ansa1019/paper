The Company acknowledges significant challenges in maintaining adequate information systems and related processes for training its workforce and appropriately sizing its supply chain infrastructure during periods of rapid demand growth or decline, noting that delays in its information systems could negatively impact its gross margins and earnings. Its risk disclosures further identify transportation, communication, demand, information technology or supply disruptions—resulting from strikes, acts of god, wars, terrorist activities or natural disasters—as potential causes of delays in shipping products and losses of customer trust. The Company depends on certain critical information systems, including telecommunications, the Internet, its corporate intranet, various computer hardware and software applications, network communications and e-mail, whether owned and maintained internally or provided by outsourced or third-party vendors, many of which employ “cloud computing” technology for confidential data storage. All such systems are subject to attacks, failures and access denials from viruses, destructive or inadequate code, power failures and physical damage to computers, hard drives, communication lines and networking equipment, and unauthorized releases or loss of sensitive information could impair the timely and efficient operation of its business despite implemented virus-protection software, security procedures and emergency recovery processes. Furthermore, outsource providers and component suppliers play a key role in the Company’s manufacturing operations and in many of its transactional and administrative functions—such as information technology, facilities management and elements of its finance organization—and any failure of these providers to perform as expected or exclusivity arrangements that preclude further business could adversely affect its business and operating results.

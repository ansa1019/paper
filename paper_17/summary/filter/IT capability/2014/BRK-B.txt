Berkshire Hathaway and its subsidiaries state that they rely on information technology in virtually all aspects of their business and warn that a significant disruption or failure of their information technology systems could result in service interruptions, safety failures, security violations, regulatory compliance failures, an inability to protect corporate information assets against intruders and other operational difficulties.  They note that attacks perpetrated against their information systems could result in loss of assets and critical information, expose them to remediation costs and reputational damage, and that, although they have taken steps intended to mitigate these risks—including business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis—a significant disruption or cyber intrusion could nevertheless lead to misappropriation of assets or data corruption and adversely affect their results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.  Furthermore, they caution that if they are unable to acquire or implement new technology, they may suffer a competitive disadvantage, and that cyber attacks could further impair their ability to operate facilities, information technology and business systems or compromise confidential customer and employee information.  They also acknowledge that failure to comply with, or reinterpretations of, existing regulations and new legislation or regulations relating to cyber security could have a significant adverse impact on their financial results.  Separately, in their railroad business, they observe that deploying new technology across BNSF Railway’s system—such as the mandated implementation of positive train control technology—may pose significant operating and implementation risks and requires significant capital expenditures.

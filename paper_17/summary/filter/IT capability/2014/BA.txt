We recognize that unauthorized access to our or our customers’ information and systems could materially impair our operations, and accordingly we maintain an extensive network of technical security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms, monitoring systems and management oversight to safeguard the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and systems; we also manage information technology systems for certain customers who face similar cyber‐threats and acknowledge that failure to prevent unauthorized access, release or corruption of customers’ confidential, classified or personally identifiable information could damage our reputation and result in financial losses. We further note that business disruptions – including information technology or cyber‐attacks, system failures or other crises – could substantially affect internal operations, our ability to deliver products and services, increase expenses or harm our corporate reputation, and that any destruction, manipulation or improper use of data, information systems or networks would negatively impact sales, costs and market responsiveness. Our fleet support services encompass information services and systems and technical data and documents, underscoring the importance of providing users with timely, accurate, reliable, secure and connected information throughout an airplane’s operational life. The complexity of commercial aircraft production and development – involving extensive coordination and integration with global suppliers and partners, the introduction of new models, ramp‐ups in production rates and ongoing derivative programs – requires identifying and implementing productivity improvements, optimizing inventory management and mobilizing technology‐based resources to support supply‐chain coordination, change management and operational flexibility. Moreover, our contract and program accounting processes depend on robust data management and information reliability to estimate revenues, costs, incentives and penalties, assess cumulative catch-up adjustments and recognize potential reach-forward losses, thereby underpinning strategic decision-making, performance monitoring and business transformation.

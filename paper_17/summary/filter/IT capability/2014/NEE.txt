NEE and FPL are highly dependent on sensitive and complex information technology systems and network infrastructure whose failure, unauthorized access or cyber attack could compromise confidential data, interrupt the ability to process and monitor large volumes of complex, multi-market transactions, generate, purchase or transmit power, bill customers and collect payments, and delay development or construction of new generating facilities. According to the Company’s disclosures, “the development and maintenance of information technology systems to keep track of and process information is critical and challenging,” and NEE and FPL “add, modify and replace information systems on a regular basis,” a process that involves integrating new systems with existing controls and procedures, ensuring accurate data conversion, adapting accounting practices, maintaining the effectiveness of the control environment and timely filing of required regulatory reports, with any disruption or deficiency potentially resulting in higher costs, revenue tracking failures and diversion of management focus. The retail business requires access to sensitive customer data in the ordinary course and often shares this information with third-party vendors for services such as call centers, creating risks of reputational harm, identity theft and regulatory claims if a material breach occurs. NEE’s risk factors further note that terrorist acts, cyber attacks and other disruptive activities “could harm NEE’s and FPL’s business, for example, by limiting their ability to generate, purchase or transmit power, by limiting their ability to bill customers and collect and process payments, and by delaying their development and construction of new generating facilities or capital improvements,” underscoring the critical role of information security and data management capabilities. In addition, the Companies maintain hedging and trading procedures and associated risk management tools—including separate but complementary financial, credit, operational, compliance and legal reporting systems, internal controls, management review processes, stop-loss limits and liquidity guidelines—to manage commodity and financial market exposures, although these measures “may not protect against significant losses,” further highlighting the importance of robust IT-enabled monitoring and reporting systems.

T-Mobile discloses that “the information technology, or IT, systems on which we rely extensively to operate, transact and otherwise manage our business and to effectively and timely report our financial results, are an important part of our internal control over financial reporting,” and acknowledges that “our information systems are vulnerable to continuously evolving data breach and information security risks” from “cyber-attacks such as denial of service, other malicious attacks, unauthorized access or distribution of confidential information by third parties or employees, errors by third party suppliers or other breaches of security”; that “hardware, software or applications we develop, have developed on our behalf, or we obtain from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could compromise information security”; and that “the methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems are also constantly changing and evolving, and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time.” The company further warns that despite having “implemented and regularly review and update processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of sensitive data and to prevent data loss,” it “cannot assure you that our systems and processes will be adequate to safeguard against all information security breaches or misuses of data,” and that any significant “attack or breach, unauthorized access, errors of third party suppliers or other security breaches, we may incur significant costs, be subject to regulatory investigations and sanctions and private litigation, and may suffer damage to our business reputation.” T-Mobile also cautions that “system failures, business disruptions, and unauthorized use of or interference with our network and other systems” may “prevent us from providing reliable service, or may allow for the unauthorized use of or interference with our networks,” citing events such as “unauthorized access to our information technology, billing, customer care and provisioning systems and networks, and those of our suppliers and other providers,” and that “any such events could cause us to lose customers, lose revenue, incur expenses, suffer reputational and goodwill damages, and subject us to litigation or governmental investigation.” The company notes reliance on “suppliers and other third parties … to develop, maintain, and troubleshoot products and services, such as network components, software development services, and billing and customer service support,” and is “in the process of transferring our customer billing systems from our existing third-party vendor to a new third-party vendor … implementing a new customer billing system … through utilization of a phased deployment approach … operate both the existing and new billing systems in parallel … post implementation,” warning that “if the implementation causes major system disruptions … customer experience may be negatively impacted,” which “could cause material adverse effects on our operational and financial performance,” and that “interruptions and/or failure of this new billing services system could disrupt our operations and impact our ability to provide or bill for our services, retain customers or attract new customers.” Finally, T-Mobile highlights the risk that “if we are unable to take advantage of technological developments on a timely basis, then we may experience a decline in demand for our services or face challenges in implementing or evolving our business strategy,” stating that “we will need to adapt to future changes in technology, enhance our existing offerings, and introduce new offerings to address our current and potential customers' changing demands,” and describes its “process of transforming and upgrading our network to deploy LTE Release 10 and use multimode integrated radios that can handle GSM, HSPA+ and LTE,” with “risks from equipment changes and migration of customers from existing spectrum bands, scheduling and supplier delays, unexpected or increased costs, technological constraints, regulatory permitting issues, subscriber dissatisfaction, and other risks” that “could cause delays in launching new network capabilities, which could result in significant costs or reduce the anticipated benefits” of such “network upgrade program.”

The company acknowledges that its operations are highly dependent on the integrity, reliability, capacity and scalability of its information technology systems, maintenance of which includes substantial investments in software development and process automation. It faces operational risk from inadequate or failed processes and systems—including human error, software flaws, capacity constraints, power outages, natural disasters and vendor outages—and notes that it could take several hours or more to restore full functionality to its technology or other operating systems after an unforeseen event. Extraordinary trading volumes could cause its computer systems to operate at unacceptably slow speeds or even fail, adversely affecting its ability to process client transactions and settle trades. The firm maintains systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance and resilience, such as backup and disaster‐recovery plans, monitoring systems, and a vendor management program, but cautions that cyber attacks, malicious code, computer viruses or denial‐of‐service attacks against its systems or those of third‐party service providers, exchanges or clearinghouses could result in unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data, breaches of confidentiality, service unavailability or other events that might harm its business, expose it to litigation or regulatory actions, damage its reputation or require significant additional resources to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities. The company also capitalizes costs for developing internal‐use software and continues to enhance its technology infrastructure to support evolving business needs, manage client relationships and leverage digital channels, while acknowledging that any operational failure—whether internal or at a key partner—can materially disrupt its ability to provide secure, timely and accurate services.

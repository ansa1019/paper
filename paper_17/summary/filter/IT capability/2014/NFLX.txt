The company’s disclosures describe an extensive information systems capability encompassing proprietary and third-party computer hardware, software, cloud computing services and content‐delivery networks deployed to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure technology resources in support of its streaming, recommendation, merchandising and payment processing operations.  They emphasize the ongoing refinement and scaling of IT architecture and operational practices—spanning in-house communications systems, third-party web hosting, Amazon Web Services and their “open connect” content‐delivery network—to manage anticipated growth in member and feature volumes, tailor service offerings to evolving business needs and sustain market agility.  The firm further highlights its information management capability in providing members with accurate, timely, secure and confidential data, integrating these capabilities with marketing, customer service and device partnerships whose technological updates can directly affect service accessibility and prominence.  Cybersecurity and resilience are underscored as strategic enablers, with encryption, authentication and other controls designed to thwart viruses, denial-of-service attacks, unauthorized intrusion and other disruptions, while acknowledging that software errors, system unavailability, natural disasters, network operator practices or device interoperability issues could undermine service continuity, impede resource deployment and adversely impact member acquisition, retention and overall firm performance.

In its risk factors the company acknowledges that information technology system failures and network disruptions could prevent access to its online stores and services, preclude retail transactions, compromise sensitive data, impede manufacturing, shipping, transaction processing and financial reporting, and that system redundancy and disaster-recovery planning may be inadequate; it relies on encryption, authentication technologies and network security—devoting significant resources to data encryption and other security measures to protect the transmission and storage of customer, employee and partner personally identifiable information—but recognizes that these measures cannot provide absolute security and are subject to third-party breaches, user error or insider threats, which could materially damage relationships and expose the company to operational, legal and reputational consequences. The company’s business requires the collection, use, retention and transfer of personally identifiable information in compliance with evolving U.S. and foreign data privacy laws, noncompliance with which may incur penalties or liability; it depends on access to third-party digital content and intellectual property licenses and, where required, digital rights management and other security solutions, noting that changes in license terms could necessitate the development or licensing of new technology. The company’s future performance depends in part on the availability and continued innovation of third-party software applications and services for its platforms, distributed through its App Store, Mac App Store, iTunes Store and related internet services, and underscores the importance of timely software upgrades and support. The company believes it is unique in designing and developing nearly the entire solution for its products—including hardware, operating systems, software applications and services—and must make significant R&D investments to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative products, services and technologies to maintain competitive advantage. In its revenue recognition policy, the company allocates revenue to unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services based on its best estimates of selling prices and recognizes such deferred revenue on a straight-line basis over the period during which the upgrades and services are expected to be provided. Finally, the company anticipates capital expenditures of approximately $15 billion in 2016 to support product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, data centers and corporate facilities including information systems hardware, software and enhancements.

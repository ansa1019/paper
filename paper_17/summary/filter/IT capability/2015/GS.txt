Goldman Sachs recognizes that advanced information technology systems are fundamental to its ability to process and monitor high‐volume, high‐frequency transactions across global markets in numerous asset classes, requiring real‐time reporting to clients, regulators and exchanges and adherence to client‐specific, legal and regulatory standards; as reporting requirements expand and transaction volumes, speed and complexity increase, the firm must continuously invest in the integration, enhancement and maintenance of its operational infrastructure, including order‐routing, execution, clearing and accounting systems, while managing the risk of human error in software development, calculations and communications. The firm’s technology governance comprises independent control functions, including a firmwide technology risk committee co‐chaired by the Chief Information Officer, which oversees cybersecurity programs, system resilience and technology risk management frameworks, and a model risk management group that validates all valuation and risk models embedded in its platforms. Regulatory developments relating to data privacy, surveillance, encryption and data on-shoring have driven changes in policies, procedures and technology for information security, increasing the importance of monitoring systems, data management, process automation and contingency planning for potential disruptions to communications, third-party vendors, clearinghouses or exchanges. Despite extensive automation and protective measures, the firm acknowledges that cyber attacks, system failures or capacity constraints may impair its liquidity and operations, and thus maintains business continuity and resilience plans, including the pre-funding of high‐quality liquid assets, timely system updates, training and systemic controls to ensure connectivity, operational efficiency and secure information management in a complex and rapidly evolving digital environment.

Comcast discloses that its success is, to a large extent, dependent on its ability to acquire, develop, adopt and leverage new and existing technologies; that wireless internet technologies continue to evolve rapidly to allow for greater speed and reliability; and that it will continue to incur additional costs as it executes technology initiatives, such as the deployment of DOCSIS 3.1, X1 set-top boxes, wireless gateways and cloud DVR technology. It warns that it may incur increased costs if changes in competitors’ products and services require research and development expenditures or repricing of existing services. The company’s network and information systems and other technologies related to network management, customer service operations and programming delivery are critical to business activities and subject to disruption or degradation from cyber attacks, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks, malicious activities, power outages or other events, any of which could require large expenditures to repair or replace damaged networks or information systems and adversely affect operations. Comcast may obtain and provide confidential, proprietary and personal information about customers, personnel and vendors in its information technology systems, and any security breach or accidental release of such information could damage its reputation, require significant capital and other resources to remedy, and expose it to regulatory enforcement or fines. The company states it develops and maintains systems and operates a comprehensive security program that requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. In addition, Comcast acknowledges its reliance on third-party vendors for the supply of significant hardware, software and operational support and notes that if these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties or fail to meet specifications, its ability to provide services may be adversely affected.

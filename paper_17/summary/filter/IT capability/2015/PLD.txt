Our operations depend on the integrity and availability of our internal information technology systems, and despite system redundancy, security measures and a disaster recovery plan, these systems remain vulnerable to energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication failures and cyber security attacks such as computer viruses or unauthorized access, any of which could interrupt our operations, cause material business disruption and additional remediation costs, or result in violations of privacy or other laws, unauthorized access to our or third-party information, significant legal and financial exposure, reputational harm, loss or misuse of data and diminished confidence in our security measures.

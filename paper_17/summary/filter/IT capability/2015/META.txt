The Company discloses that it is dependent on the interoperability of Facebook and its other products with popular mobile operating systems, networks and standards that it does not control, and that any changes in those systems or in relationships with operating‐system partners, handset manufacturers or carriers that degrade functionality, distribution, targeting or measurement capabilities could adversely affect usage and monetization; it acknowledges that delivering high‐quality mobile products requires its systems to work effectively across a range of mobile technologies, systems, networks and standards and to maintain relationships with third-party vendors, and that failure to deploy, manage or oversee global operations successfully could harm the business. The Company further explains that its reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve users depends on the reliable performance, necessary reliability and redundancy of its products and underlying technical infrastructure, and that interruptions, performance delays or degradation could disrupt service delivery and ad serving. As user base and engagement grow, including increased engagement with video, it will need increasing network capacity, computing power and technical infrastructure—including data centers and servers, which it has in part self-designed and built and plans to significantly expand—but warns that complex infrastructure expansions may face unanticipated delays, component-availability issues, operational inefficiencies or design flaws only evident upon full utilization. It discloses that its products and internal systems rely on highly technical and complex software to store, retrieve, process and manage immense amounts of data, and that this software may contain undetected errors, bugs or vulnerabilities which could lead to negative user experiences, delays in product introductions or enhancements, measurement or billing errors, data security breaches or reduced service availability. In addition, the Company notes that technologies may block the display of its ads, that inaccuracies or algorithmic errors in user-metrics measurement methodologies may arise, and that interruptions of support for third-party software platforms, such as Adobe Flash for social games, may impair payments revenue. It describes systems and processes designed to protect its data and user data from loss and security breaches, recognizing that software bugs, technical malfunctions, employee error, government surveillance or partner network failures may compromise security, and that third parties may fraudulently induce data disclosures or fail to adopt adequate security practices. Finally, it states that it is subject to complex and evolving privacy, data protection, data security, data retention and deletion, electronic communications and content laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions, which can impose operational requirements and affect its ability to deliver services.

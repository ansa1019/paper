ADP hosts, collects, uses, transmits and stores large amounts of personal and business information and focuses on ensuring its operating environments safeguard and protect data through significant investments in systems and processes. The Company relies on complex payroll, financial, accounting and other data-processing systems and devotes substantial resources to disaster recovery, business continuity and crisis-management planning to maintain availability. It continually upgrades, enhances and expands its cloud-based solutions and software applications, investing in product innovation and systems development and programming to support business strategies and evolving client needs. Robust information-security and controls programs are in place, yet hardware, software or third-party applications may contain defects that could compromise confidentiality, integrity or availability of data, and emerging threats may require additional resource allocation to modify or enhance preventive measures. ADP acknowledges that failure to adapt its technology architecture, support connectivity, ensure information reliability and tailor IT resources to changing business directions could disrupt operations, harm reputation and adversely affect financial performance.

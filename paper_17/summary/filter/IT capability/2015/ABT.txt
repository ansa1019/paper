Abbott’s operations rely on sophisticated information technology systems whose size and complexity make them vulnerable to cyber attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy or other significant disruption, and any breach could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations; these systems have been and are expected to continue to be the target of malware and other cyber attacks and third-party hacking attempts may cause customer or proprietary data to be compromised. Abbott has invested in its systems and the protection of its data to reduce the risk of unauthorized access or interruption and monitors its systems on an ongoing basis for current or potential threats, although there can be no assurance that these measures will prevent future interruptions or breakdowns that could significantly affect the business. Capital expenditures of $1.1 billion in each of 2015, 2014 and 2013 included investments in information technology, reflecting management’s commitment to upgrade and expand the firm’s IT infrastructure and support capabilities in manufacturing, research and development, and laboratory instrument platforms.

The company’s disclosures underscore an increasing dependence on sophisticated information technology and infrastructure to support its global operations, including reliance on third-party relationships and outsourcing arrangements for development, manufacturing, commercialization and support of its information technology systems.  In particular, the company warns that a significant breakdown, invasion, corruption, destruction or interruption of critical information technology systems or infrastructure—whether by authorized insiders, unauthorized persons, cyber-attacks, espionage, malware or insider threats—could negatively impact operations, cause business interruption, unintended dissemination or theft of confidential information, or reputational harm.  The ever-increasing use and evolution of technology, including cloud-based computing, creates opportunities both for the company and for threats of information leakage from non-encrypted portable devices or systems.  Although the aggregate impact of events to date has not been material, the company expects these risks to continue and has implemented ongoing monitoring of its data, information technology and personnel usage of company systems to reduce potential threats.  Additionally, the company highlights that social media platforms pose further risks of brand damage, information leakage and regulatory or legal implications arising from unauthorized or inappropriate use, leading it to adopt an internal social media policy to guide employee use, although it acknowledges that processes may not fully secure and protect information.

The company discloses that its operations and competitive positioning increasingly depend on robust information technology capabilities and networks, noting, for example, that any breach of its information technology systems—from computer viruses, unauthorized access or sabotage to vandalism or terrorism—could compromise its networks and result in unauthorized release of confidential or proprietary information, disrupt manufacturing and other operations, expose employee personal data or force increased technology protection expenditures; it warns similarly that breaches of its suppliers’ information technology systems could lead to the release of sensitive company data or impede the timely supply of critical goods and services. It emphasizes that its global operations, which include manufacturing, data and design facilities in over 30 countries, are susceptible to disruptions in transportation, communications and information technology networks, and that its ability to serve customers relies in part on its web-based channels—“tens of millions of visits to our web site each year” where design engineers initiate product selection and design-in—and on electronic design automation software governed by non-cancelable license agreements. It further describes its reliance on information systems to manage distributor and customer arrangements—recognizing revenue net of estimated allowances for price adjustments, returns and inventory consignment based on historical data and real-time inventory levels—and to monitor collectability, royalty revenues and compliance with contractual terms, underscoring the critical role of accurate, timely and secure information management in supporting its manufacturing, sales and strategic decision-making processes.

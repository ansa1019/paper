KKR’s businesses depend critically on information technology capabilities, including its financial, accounting and other data‐processing systems, information systems and technology infrastructure concentrated in New York City and across its global offices, as well as on a growing number of third‐party‐hosted solutions and technology vendors; our public markets business in particular relies on the ability to process and evaluate daily transactions across markets and geographies in a time‐sensitive, efficient and accurate manner, while consolidated portfolio companies likewise depend on secure data processing, storage and transmission systems.  We face significant operational risk from errors in execution, confirmation or settlement of transactions and from inadequate recording, evaluation or accounting of transactions in our funds, and our information systems may not continue to accommodate growth, support new products or strategies or adapt to changing business needs without substantial cost or risk.  Cybersecurity threats—including unauthorized access, theft, misuse, computer viruses and other malicious code—pose ongoing risks of data breaches or service interruptions that could result in financial loss, regulatory intervention, liability to fund investors or counterparties and reputational damage, and our business continuity and disaster recovery programs may prove insufficient to mitigate the harm of such events.  In addition, reliance on third‐party service providers for administration, tax, compliance and certain technology functions exposes us to risks that any deterioration or interruption in their performance could impair the quality of our operations, undermine our IT governance and control systems and limit our ability to grow, while increased regulatory scrutiny of cybersecurity and data protection may impose further compliance burdens and costs.

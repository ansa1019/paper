Our risk disclosures emphasize that our ability to adapt our products and services to changes in technology or in the marketplace and the success of our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology materially affect our ability to grow, noting that the markets for our products and services are characterized by constant technological changes, frequent introductions of new products and services and evolving industry standards. We acknowledge that our ability to enhance current products and services and to develop and introduce innovative offerings addressing the increasingly sophisticated needs of our clients and their customers will significantly affect our future success, yet we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction or market acceptance of these services. We describe our payments segment as providing account processing systems, electronic payments processing products and services, internet and mobile banking systems and related services, and we observe that future growth in the electronic transactions market will be driven by speed, cost, ease-of-use, security and quality of products and services, while the success of our electronic commerce businesses relies in part on third parties to market our services. We warn that operational failures—whether due to software defects, development delays, installation difficulties or failures of third-party networks and systems—could harm our business, cause us to lose clients or incur substantial expenses, and we highlight our business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities as critical to mitigating such risks. Our MD&A underscores enterprise priorities to build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions and to deliver innovation and integration that enable differentiated value. In industry trends we note increased data and transaction processing needs have led financial institutions to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions, manage information and offer new services, and to shift from in-house technology to outsourced solutions in order to remain current on technology changes, underscoring the importance of economies of scale in developing and maintaining infrastructure, technology, products, services and networks. Finally, we discuss our robust program of information security and controls designed to protect the integrity, continuity, security and trust of our systems and those of our clients while recognizing that evolving threats may require significant additional resource investment to modify, enhance or remediate our information security measures.

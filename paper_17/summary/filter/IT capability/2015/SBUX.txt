Our disclosures emphasize that our information technology systems—including point-of-sale, web and mobile platforms such as online and mobile payment systems, rewards programs and digital ventures, as well as administrative systems for human resources, payroll, accounting and internal and external communications and those of our third-party providers—are critical to coordinating our supply chain, production, distribution, sales and customer engagement processes. We operate in a highly competitive, rapidly changing environment in which the unauthorized access, theft or destruction of customer, employee or proprietary data stored in these systems could materially impact our reputation, brand and financial performance and expose us to legal liability under U.S. and international privacy and security laws. In response to frequent attempts to compromise our systems, we continue to make significant investments in technology, third-party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes designed to anticipate cyber-attacks, prevent breaches or data loss and support disaster recovery and business continuity. We also rely on these IT resources to drive convenience and brand engagement through our mobile, loyalty and digital capabilities, including mobile order and pay, and to leverage digital platforms and innovations across our retail formats. Any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security breach of our IT infrastructure—whether caused by power outages, software flaws, transition challenges, catastrophic events or cyber-attacks—or shortcomings in our disaster recovery, business continuity, IT governance, monitoring systems or change-management processes could harm our operational flexibility, process performance, customer relationships and digital initiatives and thereby adversely affect our net revenues, operating margin and earnings per share. Looking forward, we plan to continue leveraging our digital infrastructure and invest in technology governance, process optimization and capacity resilience to maintain agility, market responsiveness and long-term value creation.

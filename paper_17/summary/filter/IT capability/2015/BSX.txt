Our integration of acquired businesses requires significant efforts, including corporate restructuring and the coordination of information technologies alongside research and development, sales and marketing, operations, supply chain, manufacturing, quality systems and finance, which result in additional expenses and involve significant management time. We rely on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations, and, similar to other large multi-national companies, the size and complexity of our information technology systems makes them vulnerable to cyber-attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy or other significant disruptions. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards, the increasing need to protect patient and customer information and changing customer patterns. In addition, third parties may attempt to hack into our products to obtain data relating to patients or our proprietary information, and any failure to maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity could result in unauthorized access to patient data and personally identifiable information, theft of intellectual property or other misappropriation of assets, or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations, which in turn may cause us to lose existing customers, have difficulty preventing and detecting fraud, incur legal claims or regulatory penalties, increase operating expenses or lose revenues as a result of data privacy breaches or theft of intellectual property, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, our 2014 restructuring plan involved rationalizing organizational reporting structures to streamline various functions, eliminate bureaucracy, increase productivity and better align resources to business strategies and marketplace dynamics, as well as implementing a plant network optimization strategy aimed at simplifying our manufacturing plant structure, reducing costs and improving gross margins, reflecting a broader focus on process optimization, operational efficiencies and strategic resource allocation.

T-Mobile’s disclosures emphasize its deep reliance on information technology systems to coordinate and control business processes, noting that the company “relies heavily on information technology (“IT”) systems as an important part of our internal controls in order to operate, transact and otherwise manage our business, as well as provide effective and timely reporting of our financial results” and warning that “we cannot assure you that we will not discover material weaknesses within our IT controls or other aspects of our internal control over financial reporting in the future.”  The company is undertaking a phased deployment of a new customer billing system with a third-party vendor and acknowledges that “any unanticipated difficulties, disruption or significant delays could have adverse operational, financial and reputational effects,” while parallel operations of legacy and new systems further expose it to implementation and supplier risks.  In discussing cyber-security, T-Mobile states that its business “involves the receipt, storage and transmission of personal information, consumer preferences and payment card information” and that cyber-attacks “could disrupt our internal systems and applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers, and protect the privacy and confidentiality of our sensitive information,” with example risks including “unauthorized access to our information technology, billing, customer care and provisioning systems and networks, and those of our suppliers and other providers.”  The firm also identifies system failures or disruptions—whether caused by human error, physical damage, supplier failures or malicious attacks—as able to “cause us to lose customers, lose revenue, incur expenses, suffer reputational and goodwill damages, and subject us to litigation or governmental investigation,” underscoring the strategic imperative to invest in network modernization and IT infrastructure to support operational efficiency, competitive positioning and the coordination of internal processes with external relationships.

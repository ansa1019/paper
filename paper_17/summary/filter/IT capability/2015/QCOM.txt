Qualcomm’s annual report emphasizes its integrated hardware-software architecture and system software as foundational to the firm’s IT capability, noting that its MSM integrated circuits—including mobile data modems, single-chip and Snapdragon processors and LTE modems—“perform the core baseband modem functionality in wireless devices providing voice and data communications, as well as multimedia applications and global positioning functions,” while its Snapdragon processors “provide advanced application and graphics processing capabilities” and its system software “enables the other device components to interface with the integrated circuit products and is the foundation software enabling manufacturers to develop devices utilizing the functionality within the integrated circuits.”  The company describes its commitment to continuous R&D investment in CDMA-, OFDMA- and LTE-based technologies, OFDM-based WLAN, audio and video codecs, convergence of connectivity technologies (including Wi-Fi and LTE), cloud services, small cells, data centers, automotive infotainment, the Internet of Things and other emerging segments as critical to sustaining its competitive advantage and enabling business innovation and operational flexibility.  Qualcomm’s fabless production model and turnkey and two-stage manufacturing relationships underscore the importance of coordinating technology resources, managing supplier capacity commitments and optimizing manufacturing and testing processes to support evolving business needs.  The report also highlights the firm’s licensing model for its extensive patent portfolio—covering 3G, 4G and emerging standards—that depends on interfirm transactions and relationships, rules for open-source software integration, governance of standard-essential patents on fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms, and enforcement actions to protect its intellectual property, all of which serve to leverage Qualcomm’s IT and organizational capabilities in support of its business strategies.  Finally, the report underscores the firm’s focus on cybersecurity and information reliability, noting attempts to safeguard its products against security vulnerabilities and unauthorized access to its information technology systems while recognizing the complexity of its products and the need for ongoing process optimization, resource integration and organizational agility in response to rapid technological change, competitive forces and regulatory uncertainty.

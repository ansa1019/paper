The company’s annual report emphasizes that it “relies on its information technology environment and certain critical databases, systems and applications to support key product and service offerings,” that it has “made significant investments in information technology data centers and other technology initiatives” (while noting no assurance those investments will drive revenue growth), and that it has established “policies, processes and internal controls to ensure the stability of our information technology, provide security from unauthorized access to our systems and maintain business continuity.” The report cautions, however, that “unanticipated system failures, data corruption or unauthorized access to our systems,” “infrastructure or network failures, malicious or defective software, human error, natural disasters, service outages at third-party internet providers or increased government regulation” could materially disrupt operations, financial condition or reputation, particularly given that “many of our products and services are delivered electronically” via “computer-based networks” and the internet, and that “delays in our ability to deliver our products and services electronically may harm our reputation and result in the loss of customers” who “entrust us with storing and securing their data and information on our servers.” Although the company maintains “disaster recovery plans that include backup facilities for our primary data centers,” it acknowledges those systems “are not always fully redundant, and our disaster planning may not always be sufficient or effective,” and it recognizes risk in having “outsourced certain support functions to third-party service providers to leverage leading specialized capabilities and achieve cost efficiencies,” since a provider’s failure could “result in business disruption, processing inefficiencies or harm employee morale.” The report also notes exposure to “cyber-attacks common to most industries, to more advanced threats,” and that “any material incidents could cause reputational harm, loss of customers, regulatory actions, sanctions or other statutory penalties, litigation or financial losses,” while observing that “our ability to protect our intellectual property rights could impact our competitive position” and that it “utilizes certain data provided by third-party data sources in a variety of ways, including large volumes of data from certain stock exchanges around the world.”

The Company discloses that it “relies extensively on computer systems to process transactions, summarize results, and manage our business” and that “given the very high volume of transactions we process each year it is important that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical computer systems,” noting that power outages, hardware or telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, natural disasters and human error could damage or interrupt both primary and back-up systems, requiring “significant investments to fix or replace them” and potentially causing material adverse effects on operations and financial results. It further states that it “is currently making, and will continue to make, significant technology investments to improve or replace our information processes and systems that are key to managing our business,” but warns that “failure to monitor and choose the right investments and implement them at the right pace would be harmful,” that “excessive technological change could impact the effectiveness of adoption and make it more difficult to realize benefits,” and that “potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term” or yield delayed or more costly benefits. The Report emphasizes the centrality of information security and privacy, noting the Company “receives, retains, and transmits certain personal information about our members and entrust that information to third-party business associates, including cloud service providers,” and that “our online business … depends upon the secure transmission of encrypted confidential information over public networks,” warning that a “compromise of our security systems or those of our business associates” could harm the Company’s reputation, operations and liquidity, trigger litigation or penalties, and require “additional resources related to the security of information systems.” It acknowledges that privacy and information-security laws “change, and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the development of new administrative processes,” and that “an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate business and personal information,” as demonstrated by a July 2015 breach of its online photo-center host, after which that provider “implemented new technology with enhanced security features.” The Company likewise warns that it “relies on third parties to provide payment transaction processing services,” is subject to “payment card association rules and network operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers,” and that non-compliance or an internal system breach could leave it “liable for banks’ compromised card re-issuance costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and/or debit card payments,” thereby adversely affecting business and operating results. Finally, the Company highlights its multichannel strategy, observing that “members, especially younger members, are increasingly using computers, tablets, mobile phones, and other devices to shop,” that it is “making technology investments in our websites and mobile applications,” and that “if we are unable to make, improve, or develop relevant member-facing technology in a timely manner, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected.”

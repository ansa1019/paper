Microsoft’s 10-K discloses that the company has made significant investments to develop and deploy cloud-based services and the supporting data-center and network infrastructure needed to deliver high-performance, platform-agnostic experiences across PCs, smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles and other devices.  It highlights an evolving internal IT environment in which Microsoft often serves as an early adopter of new devices and consumer-oriented technologies, embraces new methods of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners, and increasingly relies on data-driven insights to improve monetization, customer perceptions of quality, and operational efficiency.  The company recognizes that execution of its mobile-first, cloud-first strategy depends on its ability to engineer more secure products and services, enhance security and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to address vulnerabilities, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of its network and services, and provide customers with security tools such as firewalls and anti-virus software.  It further acknowledges that evolving cyber threats—from individual hackers to state-sponsored actors—may breach internal systems, impair service delivery, compromise confidential business information, and require allocation of resources to improved technologies and controls.  These disclosures underscore Microsoft’s focus on mobilizing and deploying IT resources—including software development, datacenter capacity, security practices, and integration of internal processes—to support and enhance its business strategies, manage competitive and regulatory risks, and sustain its leadership in digital platforms and productivity services.

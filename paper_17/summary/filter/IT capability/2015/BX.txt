Blackstone relies heavily on its financial, accounting, communications and other data processing systems to support its global businesses, and it recognizes that these infrastructures may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of tampering, breaches of network security systems or other disruptions.  The firm’s systems face ongoing cybersecurity threats and attacks that could involve attempts to obtain unauthorized access to proprietary information, destroy data or disable, degrade or sabotage critical applications, any of which could lead to financial loss, business interruption, regulatory intervention or reputational harm.  In addition, Blackstone’s information systems and technology may not continue to be able to accommodate its growth and increasing operational complexity, and the cost of maintaining and upgrading such systems may increase materially.  Blackstone also depends on electronic‐communications infrastructure, disaster recovery programs and third-party service providers for critical information systems and technology, and any disruption or deterioration in these infrastructures or services could impair fund operations, jeopardize data integrity and create deficiencies in compliance and internal reporting.  Moreover, a disaster or disruption in infrastructure supporting electronic communications—including those used by third parties—could have a material adverse impact on the firm’s ability to operate without interruption.

NVIDIA’s disclosures emphasize that the security, resilience and performance of its information technology environment are critical to supporting its complex product development, manufacturing and business processes.  The Company acknowledges that security breaches, computer malware and cyber-attacks—whether on its own systems or on third-party business management and communication software products on which it relies—have become more prevalent and sophisticated and may misappropriate or compromise proprietary, sensitive or confidential information or disrupt over-the-air updates for consumer and automotive products, potentially causing system shutdowns, interruptions in order fulfillment or other critical functions, loss of customers, reduced revenue, increased expenses and damage to its reputation.  NVIDIA further notes that interruptions, delays or cessations of service arising from IT system failures, natural or man-made disasters at its principal datacenters in California, or other business disruptions could materially harm its ability to meet market needs and erode financial results.  The Company also identifies its dependence on third-party software development tools to design, simulate and verify complex product features as a business risk: when available tools lack sufficient functionality or fail to accurately model its products’ capabilities, NVIDIA may miss design cycles, lose design wins and suffer declines in market share and revenue.  Finally, NVIDIA cautions that its reliance on third-party manufacturing, assembly and packaging technologies reduces its direct control over product development schedules and quality, which may adversely affect its business if such partners cannot allocate adequate capacity or deploy leading-edge processes in a timely manner.

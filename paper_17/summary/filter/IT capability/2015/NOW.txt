We expect our costs to increase in future periods as we continue to invest in our capacity to support anticipated growth, including substantial investments in data centers and cloud computing infrastructure, and note that these investments may not result in increased revenues or growth in our business; we have introduced products in new markets for IT operations management, customer service, security incident management and use of our platform for service management outside of enterprise IT, requiring resources such as employees with product management, engineering, marketing and sales expertise to configure and deploy our multi-tenant subscription service; we bill subscription fees in annual increments upon contract execution, recognize subscription revenues ratably over non-cancelable terms, and defer and amortize directly related commissions and referral fees to align IT investment costs with revenue recognition; our professional services engagements, performed by our internal services team and contracted third-party partners, implement and configure our cloud-based platform and are recognized as service revenues as work is performed; we continue to enhance our enterprise cloud computing solutions to deliver consumer-product-like experiences—intuitive user interfaces, mobility, messaging, social networking, database, hardware and security technologies—and warn that failure to introduce such innovation on a timely, cost-effective basis could cause our offerings to become less competitive or obsolete; we store, transmit and process our customers’ confidential, proprietary and sensitive information in global data center facilities, maintain security measures designed to protect customer data and our IT infrastructure, and recognize that cybersecurity breaches, operational disruptions, regulatory developments in data privacy and sovereignty, and disasters at third-party or co-located data centers could impair IT effectiveness, require significant remediation investments, expose us to litigation or penalties and harm our competitive position, customer relationships, renewal rates and financial results.

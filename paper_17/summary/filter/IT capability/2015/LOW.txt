We have developed a risk management process using periodic surveys, external research, planning processes, risk mapping, analytics and other tools to identify and evaluate operational, financial, environmental, reputational, strategic and other risks. The success of our strategic initiatives to adapt our business concept to evolving omni-channel retailing will require us to deliver large, complex programs requiring more integrated planning, initiative prioritization and program sequencing, and will require new competencies in many positions, obliging our management, employees and contractors to adapt and learn new skills and capabilities. In this context, our customer-facing technology systems must appeal to customers, function as designed and provide a consistent customer experience across computers, tablets, mobile phones and other devices, and any failure of those systems to perform effectively and reliably—including performance issues, temporary outages caused by distributed denial of service or other cyber-attacks, or a lack of a disaster recovery plan—could prevent us from delivering positive customer experiences. Access to the Internet has empowered our customers and changed the way they shop and how we interact with them, and our websites, including lowes.com and lowesforpros.com, as well as mobile apps, serve as sales channels and methods of making product, project and other relevant information available, impacting in-store sales. We use third-party service providers for authentication, content delivery, back-office support and other functions and receive and store sensitive customer, employee and vendor information, and despite continued vigilance and investment in information security, we or our service providers may be unable to anticipate or prevent a breach that results in the unauthorized release of sensitive data, which could materially increase our risk protection costs and expose us to liability and fines as regulatory obligations evolve. We accept payments via multiple methods subject to stringent compliance requirements and rely on third parties for payment processing, and any failure to comply with these rules or a breach of our data security systems could result in liability, higher transaction fees and the loss of payment acceptance capabilities, all of which could disrupt our business. Finally, our ability to provide an integrated omni-channel experience depends on ongoing investment in, maintenance of and improvements to our critical management information systems that support operations such as sales, inventory replenishment, merchandise ordering, project design and execution, transportation, receipt processing and fulfillment, and our financial performance could be adversely affected if these systems are seriously disrupted or if we are unable to maintain, improve, upgrade and expand our systems, which are subject to damage or interruption from catastrophic events, power outages, viruses, malicious attacks and telecommunications failures.

The company acknowledges that maintaining competitive advantage requires continuous adaptation to rapid and significant technological change and substantial investment in product development, including the enhancement of e-business capabilities to coordinate design, manufacturing and customer-support processes. It reports that, as part of its ongoing transformation, it periodically upgrades its information systems—implementing new enterprise resource planning software and other applications—to support quotes, order entry, billing, supplier and customer interactions, and back-office functions, thereby mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with other organizational assets. The company relies on its global technology infrastructure to interact with suppliers, sell products and services, fulfill orders and manage financial activities, but it warns that unforeseen problems with system implementation and maintenance, vulnerability to natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failures, cyberattacks or lack of system redundancy could interrupt service, cause data loss or reduce functionality, impairing information accuracy, timeliness, security and access. It further notes that without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements—and the effective deployment and reconfiguration of IT resources—its offerings may become technologically obsolete and its revenue and operating results may suffer, underscoring the importance of strategic technology investment, capability development and coordination of assets, internal processes and interfirm relationships to preserve operational flexibility, market agility and firm performance.

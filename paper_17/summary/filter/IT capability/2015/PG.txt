Procter & Gamble relies extensively on information technology systems, networks and services—including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities, hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed or hosted by third parties—to support core activities such as ordering and managing materials from suppliers; converting materials to finished products; shipping products to customers; marketing and selling to consumers; collecting, transmitting, transferring and storing customer, consumer, employee, vendor, investor and other stakeholder information; summarizing and reporting results of operations; hosting, processing and sharing confidential and proprietary research, business plans and financial information; complying with regulatory, legal and tax requirements; providing data security; and handling other critical processes. Its Global Business Services organization provides technology, processes and standard data tools to enable global business units and selling and market operations to better understand the business and serve consumers and customers by delivering world-class solutions at a low cost and with minimal capital investment. The company acknowledges numerous and evolving information security threats—including advanced persistent cybersecurity threats—and continually assesses potential threats and makes targeted investments in preventive measures such as network and system monitoring, skill upgrades, employee training and security policies for the company and its third-party providers; nonetheless, its IT systems remain subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, phishing and other cyber-attacks that could result in loss, unavailability or disclosure of business or stakeholder information. A cybersecurity breach or failure of key IT systems, networks or service providers—arising from causes ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling or security breaches—could expose the company to significant reputational, competitive and operational harm, as well as litigation and regulatory action, and the costs and operational consequences of responding to such breaches and implementing remediation measures could be material.

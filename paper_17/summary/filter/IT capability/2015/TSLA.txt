Tesla’s vehicles incorporate complex information technology systems, including built-in data connectivity to support periodic remote software updates, Internet connectivity services, Autopilot hardware and access to the Supercharger network, which has resulted in material costs allocated to connectivity in automotive revenues. The operation of these systems is highly dependent on software functionality for features such as the 17-inch display screen, panoramic roof and 12-volt battery, and Tesla has designed, implemented and tested security measures to prevent unauthorized access to its IT networks, vehicles and their data; however, software defects, cyber-attack attempts or data loss could disrupt data management, production and customer satisfaction, expose the Company to regulatory, litigation or warranty liabilities and adversely affect its brand. Tesla maintains a privacy policy and takes steps to secure customers’ personal information in compliance with federal, state and international data protection laws, yet remains subject to potential breaches and related remediation requirements. In its Management’s Discussion, Tesla notes that scaling volume production and global expansion of retail, service and supercharging infrastructure necessitates ongoing development, maintenance and improvement of internal IT systems across product data management, procurement, inventory management, production planning and execution, sales, service and logistics, dealer management, and financial, tax and regulatory compliance, with inherent risks that implementation or expansion disruptions could impair procurement, manufacturing execution, finance, supply chain and sales processes, delay financial reporting and certification of internal controls and require significant corrective investment. Furthermore, the Company’s revenue recognition practices reflect deferred revenue for over-the-air updates and connectivity services, underscoring the importance of its IT capability in coordinating its assets, processes and external relationships to deliver and support its electric vehicles.

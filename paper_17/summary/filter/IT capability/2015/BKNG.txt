Our annual report discloses that our business is fundamentally dependent upon the effective deployment and management of information technology resources, noting that “our business is dependent on the internet and maintaining connectivity between ourselves and consumers, sources of internet traffic, such as google, and our travel service providers,” and warning that “fluctuations in internet access, whether generally, in a specific market or otherwise … could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.”  We “rely on online advertising channels to enhance our brand awareness and to generate a significant amount of traffic to our websites,” and caution that “if google changes how it presents travel search results or the manner in which it conducts the auction for placement among search results … our ability to efficiently generate traffic to our websites could be harmed.”  Acknowledging the evolution of digital platforms, we highlight that “widespread adoption of mobile devices, such as the iphone, android-enabled smart phones and tablets such as the ipad … is driving substantial online traffic and commerce to mobile platforms,” and that our “mobile offerings have received generally strong reviews and are driving a material and increasing share of our business,” making it “increasingly important for us to develop and maintain effective mobile apps and websites optimized for mobile devices to provide consumers with an appealing, easy-to-use mobile experience.”  We stress our reliance on complex IT infrastructures and systems—both internally developed and third-party—for “transaction processing, order management and financial systems,” and the need to “significantly expand and upgrade our technology … and other infrastructure” as usage grows, while cautioning that “we may not be able to upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate such conditions in a timely manner.”  Our disclosures describe extensive measures to secure and govern our information technology—including “encryption and authentication technologies to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent unauthorized access,” requirements for “user names and passwords in order to access our information technology systems,” and maintenance of “redundant systems and hosting services” in facilities worldwide—yet acknowledge that “our existing security measures may not be successful in preventing security breaches,” that “we have experienced targeted and organized phishing attacks” and “denial-of-service type attacks,” and that breaches “could result in severe damage to our information technology infrastructure … as well as loss of customer, financial or other data,” negative publicity, litigation, regulatory penalties and loss of consumer confidence.  We further note that “in our processing of travel transactions, we receive and store a large volume of personally identifiable data,” which is subject to evolving global data privacy regulations, and that “non-compliance with these laws could result in penalties or significant legal liability.”  Finally, we recognize our dependence on IT-enabled partnerships and data integrations, stating that “Kayak depends on access to information related to travel service pricing, schedules, availability and other related information from OTCs and travel service providers,” that our “online advertising revenues” and “Bookingsuite marketing and analytics services” are underpinned by our digital infrastructure, and that OpenTable’s “reservation management services” likewise rely on our coordinated technology platforms.

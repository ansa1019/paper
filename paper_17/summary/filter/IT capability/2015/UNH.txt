UnitedHealth Group leverages core competencies in advanced, enabling technology, health care data, information and intelligence across its diversified businesses and through Optum’s information and technology-enabled health services. The company periodically consolidates, integrates, upgrades and expands its information systems capabilities as a result of technology initiatives, regulatory requirements, system platform changes and business acquisition integrations, and it has invested in more sophisticated applications for mobile devices to support greater consumer engagement. Its ability to price products, deliver uninterrupted service and report accurately depends on the integrity, availability and timely processing of data in its information systems, which require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems that keep pace with evolving information-processing technology, regulatory standards and customer preferences. Certain businesses sell and install software products that must interoperate seamlessly with competing technologies, and connectivity among technologies has become increasingly important in the health care industry; a failure of these technology products to operate as intended and in concert could materially and adversely affect results of operations. Uncertain and rapidly evolving U.S., non-U.S. and international laws and regulations governing health information technology may materially affect the configuration of the company’s information systems and platforms and its ability to compete. The firm routinely processes, stores and transmits large volumes of sensitive personal and proprietary data via its information technology systems, which exposes it to cyber-attacks and other privacy or data-security incidents whereby hackers, malware or human error could penetrate layered security controls, disrupt operations or result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Such breaches could damage its reputation, invite regulatory sanctions and litigation, increase operational costs and materially impair its business, financial condition and cash flows.

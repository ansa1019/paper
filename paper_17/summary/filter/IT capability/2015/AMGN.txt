We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems, infrastructure and data security, and we recognize that the multitude and complexity of our computer systems and the potential value of our data make them inherently vulnerable to service interruptions or destruction, malicious intrusions and random attacks. Data privacy or security breaches by employees or others may expose sensitive data—including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to the company, its patients, customers or other business partners—to unauthorized persons or to the public. As a global biotechnology company, our systems are subject to frequent cyber-attacks that are growing in frequency, sophistication and intensity and are often carried out by motivated, well-resourced, skilled and persistent actors, including nation states, organized crime groups and “hacktivists.” Such cyber-attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware and key loggers, denial-of-service attacks, malicious websites, social engineering and other means to compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our IT systems, infrastructure and data. Our key business partners face similar risks and any security breach of their systems could adversely affect our security posture. Although we have experienced cyber-attacks and intrusions in the past, we do not believe those attacks have had a material adverse effect on our operations. We continue to invest heavily in the protection of our critical or sensitive data and information technology, but no assurance can be given that our efforts will prevent or detect interruptions or breaches in our systems, which in turn could adversely affect our business, operations or result in the loss of critical or sensitive information and potential financial, legal, business or reputational harm.

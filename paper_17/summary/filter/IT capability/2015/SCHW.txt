Technology and operational failures or errors could subject the company to losses, litigation, and regulatory actions, as operational risk encompasses inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, human error, execution errors, software flaws, capacity constraints, power outages, computer viruses, distributed-denial-of-service attacks, and similar events; for example, denial-of-service attacks have rendered websites, mobile applications, and email unavailable, and it may take extended periods to restore full functionality to technology or other operating systems, impairing the company’s ability to process and settle client transactions. Despite substantial attention and resources devoted to the reliability, capacity, and scalability of its systems, including duplicate data centers, backup and recovery facilities, periodic disaster-recovery testing, and significant investments in information technology equipment and internally-developed software capitalized during development, the company acknowledges that extraordinary trading volumes or third-party vendor failures—whether from systems outages, capacity constraints, financial difficulties, or other causes—could disrupt operations, delay or misprice client transactions, reduce operational efficiency, and erode client confidence. The company relies on outsourced service providers for key technology, processing, servicing, and support functions under contractual standards of care and ongoing monitoring, but switching providers may require extended transitions and yield less efficient operations. Information security risks are increasing as the company’s business involves secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential data over internet and mobile technologies, making systems targets for cyber attacks, malicious code, and phishing, which could cause unauthorized access, data loss or destruction, account takeovers, compliance breaches, legal liability, reputational harm, and regulatory sanctions; the company maintains comprehensive policies, advanced monitoring tools, employee authentication measures, data-security training, and vendor-management controls, yet acknowledges evolving threats may outpace preventive measures. In addition, planned strategic transactions may require integration of operational, financial, and management information systems and controls, and ongoing regulatory changes demand significant management attention and resources to evaluate, develop, integrate, and refine systems and procedures for compliance, risk management, and operational effectiveness.

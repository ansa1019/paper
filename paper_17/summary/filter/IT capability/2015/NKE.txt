Nike’s risk disclosures highlight significant exposures related to its information technology capabilities, noting “difficulties in implementing, operating and maintaining Nike’s increasingly complex information systems and controls, including …the systems related to demand and supply planning and inventory control; interruptions in data and information technology systems; consumer data security.” The Company “is heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks, including the internet and third-party hosted services,” across its supply chain, product design, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales and distribution, and for processing financial information and meeting regulatory reporting requirements, and its “ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these information technology systems.” Failures “to operate effectively, including as a result of security breaches, viruses, hackers or other causes, or problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems” could “cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem, and may have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition.” Similarly, if these systems suffer “severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results, which could result in lost revenues and profits, as well as reputational damage.” Nike further warns that its e-commerce business is contingent on “technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online” and that “many of our customers shop with us through our e-commerce website and mobile commerce applications,” while the Company also “depends on information technology systems and personal data collection and use for digital marketing, digital commerce and the marketing and use of our Nike+ products and services” and “engage[s] in electronic communications throughout the world” via these systems. The risk factors underscore that any breach or misuse of confidential information or failure to comply with “increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data” could “give rise to unwanted media attention, materially damage our customer relationships and reputation and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits,” while noting that, despite “contractual measures such as entering into non-disclosure and non-compete agreements and providing confidential information awareness training,” “our controls and efforts to prevent unauthorized use and/or disclosure of confidential information might not always be effective,” potentially resulting in loss of reputation, competitive disadvantage and adverse financial impact.

The company discloses that it expects to continue to invest significant management attention and resources in its information technology infrastructure and in its privacy and security capabilities to support its shift to connected services, solve problems more efficiently, expand third-party technology relationships and strategic partnerships, and meet changing customer needs. It warns that business interruption or failure of its information technology and communication systems—including those of external service providers such as third-party internet-based or “cloud” computing services—and a lack of redundancy in certain data centers or disaster-recovery planning could lead to data loss, processing failures, service interruptions, reputational harm and materially adverse financial results. The report describes ongoing efforts to update customer-facing applications and supporting IT infrastructure, to migrate applications and infrastructure to new data centers and third-party hosted environments, and to upgrade network security, high-availability capabilities and other information systems, noting that difficulties in integrating hardware and software updates, delays in system enhancements or vulnerabilities to natural disasters or cyber attacks could disrupt operations, increase costs and erode customer confidence. It highlights reliance on internal and external systems to process customer orders and service requests, the hosting, collection, use and retention of large and growing volumes of sensitive personal customer and employee data protected by commercially available security technologies and business controls that cannot provide absolute security, and exposure to increasingly sophisticated cyber threats that may require substantial resources to detect, remediate or combat. In its discussion of cost of revenue, the company identifies direct costs associated with providing online services, including data-center hosting and support costs that have increased in its small business segment, and in its liquidity and capital resources section it emphasizes continuous investment in network and data-center infrastructure and internal technology systems, cautioning that unsuccessful implementation of these improvements could result in outages, disruption of business operations, loss of revenue or damage to its reputation.

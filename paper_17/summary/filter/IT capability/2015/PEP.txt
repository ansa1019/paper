The Companyâ€™s disclosures underscore that its ability to operate in a highly competitive, digitally driven environment depends on robust information technology capabilities to coordinate assets, internal processes and interfirm relationships. Management describes a multi-year business transformation to migrate financial and other systems to enterprise-wide platforms and to automate packaging, warehousing and production monitoring, illustrating its focus on deploying and reconfiguring IT resources in support of work processes and strategic initiatives. The Company relies on public websites, cloud-based services and shared IT support for payroll, benefits administration and finance functions to facilitate e-commerce, digital marketing, supply-chain management, financial reporting, tax compliance and human resource processes. It recognizes that insufficient resources, inadequate monitoring of third-party service providers, failure to upgrade security policies or address network vulnerabilities could expose the enterprise to cyberattacks, system failures or data breaches that would disrupt transactions, impair communication among customers, suppliers, bottlers and employees, compromise confidential information and weaken operational flexibility, organizational resilience and overall firm performance.

Our success depends in part on our ability to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and offerings to serve the evolving needs of our clients, including digital-, cloud- and security-related offerings, as well as developments in areas such as artificial intelligence, augmented reality, automation, blockchain, internet of things, quantum computing and as-a-service solutions. Technological developments may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients and, in the case of as-a-service solutions, could affect the nature of how we generate revenue, as some of these technologies have reduced and replaced historical services and solutions and may cause clients to delay spending while they evaluate new technologies. We operate in a rapidly evolving environment in which there currently are, and we expect will continue to be, new technology entrants, and new services or technologies offered by competitors or new entrants may make our offerings less differentiated or less competitive when compared to other alternatives. Our growth strategy focuses on responding to these developments by driving innovation that will enable us to expand our business into new growth areas, and if we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and adapt to industry developments, our services and solutions, our results of operations, and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and to execute on our growth strategy could be negatively affected. We are dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely process, transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our people, clients, alliance partners and vendors, and as the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure continues to grow, including as a result of the use of mobile technologies, social media and cloud-based services, the risk of security breaches and cyberattacks increases. In providing services and solutions to clients, we often manage, utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or Accenture data, including personal data, and we expect these activities to increase, including through the use of analytics, but unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or Accenture data, whether through systems failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, could damage our reputation, cause us to lose clients and result in significant financial exposure. Cybersecurity threats are constantly expanding and evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and defending against them, and we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information, such as the national laws implementing the European Union directive on data protection (which will be replaced by the European Union General Data Protection Regulation from 2018 onwards), various U.S. federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other personally identifiable information and data privacy and cybersecurity laws in other regions, which are increasing in complexity and number and changing frequently, resulting in greater compliance risk and cost for us. A failure of a clientâ€™s system based on our services or solutions could also subject us to a claim for significant damages that could materially adversely affect our results of operations.

Our integration of acquired businesses requires significant efforts, including the coordination of information technologies, research and development, sales and marketing, operations, regulatory, supply chain, manufacturing, quality systems and finance, and many of our CRM product offerings combine the sale of a device with our Latitude™ patient management system, which represents a future service obligation for which we defer and recognize revenue over the related service period based on relative selling price; we rely on information technology systems, including third‐party technologies, to process, transmit and store electronic information in our day‐to‐day operations and our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and to develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards, the increasing need to protect patient and customer information and changing customer patterns; the size and complexity of our information technology systems make them vulnerable to cyber‐attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy or other significant disruption, and third parties may attempt to hack into our products to obtain patient data or disrupt product performance or to access our proprietary information, while defects or vulnerabilities in third‐party technologies may create further risks; any failure to maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity, including from cyber‐attacks, intrusions or other breaches, could result in unauthorized access to patient data and personally identifiable information, theft of intellectual property or other misappropriation of assets, or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations; we also grow our company through acquisitions and may face risks associated with defects and vulnerabilities in acquired systems as we integrate those businesses into our information technology system; in the U.S., federal and state privacy and security laws require protection of personal information, including patient medical records, while in Europe the Data Protection Directive and the General Data Protection Regulation impose obligations on the handling, localization and transfer of individually identifiable information and may impose fines for violations, and certain international jurisdictions require data to be maintained on local servers and restrict transfers; any enforcement actions or breaches arising from failures in compliance may be costly, interrupt regular operations, cause the loss of customers, lead to increased operating expenses, disputes, legal claims, regulatory sanctions or penalties, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

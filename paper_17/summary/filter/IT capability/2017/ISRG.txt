Information technology helps us operate efficiently, interface with customers, maintain financial accuracy and efficiency, and accurately produce our financial statements; if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach. Our data management systems must effectively collect, store, process, and report relevant data for the operation of our business, and any impairment—whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies, or human error—could materially impair our ability to plan, forecast, and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations. We require user names and passwords to access our information technology systems and use encryption and authentication technologies to secure data transmission and storage, yet security measures may be compromised by unauthorized persons, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management, phishing attacks, or other irregularities, resulting in unauthorized access to our data or accounts. In addition, unauthorized third parties may attempt to hack into our products or systems to obtain patient, employee, or proprietary data, and, if successful, they may create issues with product functionality that could pose a risk of data loss, patient safety, product recall, or field action. Although we invest significant resources in network security, data encryption, and other measures in accordance with industry and regulatory standards, these measures cannot provide absolute security; we also rely on external vendors for certain information technology systems, and any failure of their security programs could unexpectedly compromise our own systems. A breach of our systems or unauthorized release of personally identifiable information could materially damage our reputation, reduce use of our products and services, expose us to litigation and liability, and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

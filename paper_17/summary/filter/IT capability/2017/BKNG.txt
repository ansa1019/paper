Booking Holdings’ ability to operate and expand its online travel and restaurant reservation services relies heavily on the coordination and mobilization of its IT capability: the acquisition, deployment, combination and reconfiguration of information technology resources including its websites, mobile apps and optimized platforms, data center infrastructure and cloud services, network and communication facilitation, internally‐developed and third‐party transaction processing, order management and financial systems, encryption and authentication systems and monitoring systems, and personnel skillsets dedicated to software development, system maintenance and cybersecurity. The markets in which the company competes are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and the proliferation of digital technologies, such that in order to maintain competitive advantage and meet customer and partner needs, Booking Holdings must continually invest significant resources in performance and brand advertising, process automation, platform enhancements, mobile‐first strategies and IT governance while managing system capacity constraints, failures or denial‐of‐service attacks, disruptions in internet access, and third‐party dependencies. The firm’s IT capability underpins its business innovation, operational flexibility and market responsiveness by harnessing data management, analytics, strategic alignment, and dynamic capabilities to optimize work processes, support secure consumer transactions under global data protection regulations and payment card rules, and deliver a reliable, scalable, and integrated digital infrastructure that sustains its organizational effectiveness and competitive positioning.

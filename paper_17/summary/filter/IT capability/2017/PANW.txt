The Company repeatedly warns that its rapid growth and increasingly complex deployments of products and subscriptions place a significant strain on its information technology and financial infrastructure, its operating and administrative systems, and its ability to coordinate headcount, capital and internal processes, and that failure to effectively manage any future growth or to improve and scale its systems, processes and controls—including through third-party software—could increase costs, disrupt end-customer relationships, limit platform deployments, introduce errors or fraud, and materially impair operating results. The risk disclosures also note that deficiencies or delays in systems related to order review, processing, logistics or compliance could prevent timely revenue recognition and harm financial performance. In its MD&A, the Company underscores that to manage future growth effectively it must continue to improve and expand its IT and financial infrastructure, its operating and administrative systems, and its ability to manage headcount, capital and processes efficiently, while acknowledging that these areas present both strategic opportunities and execution risks. Moreover, the MD&A highlights the Company’s core IT capability in pioneering a next-generation security platform—comprising physical and virtual firewalls driven by a proprietary traffic classification engine, advanced endpoint protection, and cloud-based threat intelligence—which mobilizes and deploys technology, knowledge, management skills and organizational resources to enable application visibility and control, secure data, simplify operations, and transform the firm into a competitive force.

Coca-Cola’s strategic priorities expressly include “digitizing the enterprise” to support its digital transformation objectives. In February 2012, the company launched a productivity and reinvestment program focused on global supply chain optimization, global marketing and innovation effectiveness, operating expense leverage and operational excellence, data and information technology systems standardization and the integration of its former North America bottling operations. In April 2017, this program was expanded to deliver an additional $800 million in annualized savings by 2019 through further efficiencies in the supply chain and marketing expenditures and a new, more agile operating model supported by an expanded enabling services organization and corporate center to simplify and standardize key transactional processes. During 2017 the company recorded charges related to costs incurred for the implementation of information technology systems to facilitate consistent data standards and availability throughout its bottling systems.

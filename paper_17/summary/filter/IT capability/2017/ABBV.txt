AbbVie depends on sophisticated information technology systems to operate its business and coordinate its assets, processes, supply chain and transactional activities, and it also relies on third-party providers for information technology, accounting, human resources, payroll and other outsourced services; these systems and services support critical functions such as data privacy, security, connectivity, monitoring and access to sensitive data, intellectual property, trade secrets and personal information, and although AbbVie has invested in ongoing protection and oversight, malicious intrusion, random attack, breakdowns or failures of its in-house or outsourced IT infrastructure could expose confidential information and materially disrupt its operations and adversely affect its financial condition.

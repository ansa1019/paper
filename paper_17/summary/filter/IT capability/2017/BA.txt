Boeing discloses that unauthorized access to its or its customers’ information and systems could negatively impact its business and that it faces security threats to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of its data and systems; to address these threats it maintains an extensive network of technical security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms, monitoring systems and management oversight in order to prevent, detect and respond to unauthorized activity in its systems, although certain types of attacks, including cyber-attacks, could result in significant financial or information losses and reputational harm. It further warns that business disruptions—including threats to physical security, information technology or cyber-attacks or failures—could seriously affect its future sales and financial condition or increase its costs and expenses, noting that any significant production delays or any destruction, manipulation or improper use of its data, information systems or networks could impact its sales, raise expenses and have an adverse effect on the reputation of Boeing and its products and services. In addition, Boeing manages information and information technology systems for certain customers, many of which face similar security threats, and acknowledges that if it cannot prevent unauthorized access, release or corruption of its customers’ confidential, classified or personally identifiable information, its reputation could be damaged and it could face financial losses.

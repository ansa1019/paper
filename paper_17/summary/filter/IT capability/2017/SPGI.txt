The annual report discloses that the company continues significant investments in information technology data centers and other technology initiatives to support product delivery and revenue generation while acknowledging the risks that such IT investments may not yield the desired returns. It emphasizes that the rapid change of technology across its markets necessitates deploying improved processes and technologies to innovate, design, develop, test, market and support new and enhanced products in a timely, cost-effective manner, including related change-management efforts to implement process and technology improvements. The company relies on its information technology environment and critical databases, systems and applications—both internal and outsourced, including third-party cloud infrastructure—to deliver products, process and secure data, maintain business continuity and protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information, yet warns that outages, cyberattacks, system failures, data corruption or unauthorized access could materially disrupt operations and customer service. As part of its stated strategy, it is enhancing planning and software-engineering processes to accelerate content delivery, applying lean management, robotics, automation and machine-learning to streamline workflows and boost productivity, and strengthening its digital infrastructure capabilities with emphasis on workplace services and cybersecurity. The report further notes that outsourcing functions to third parties to leverage specialized capabilities and cost efficiencies involves the risk that such providers may fail to meet performance, security or regulatory standards, potentially resulting in financial loss, reputational harm or regulatory action, and underscores that its disaster-recovery plans and system redundancy—particularly limited in smaller locations—are essential to mitigate disruptions that could impair coordination of the firm’s assets, internal processes and interfirm relationships. Continuous cybersecurity measures, employee training and contractual safeguards are maintained to deter and detect unauthorized use of material non-public information, although the evolving sophistication of cyber threats and insider risks demands ongoing investment in security controls, monitoring systems and incident-response capabilities.

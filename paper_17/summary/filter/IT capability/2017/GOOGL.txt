Alphabet’s 10-K emphasizes that its IT capability—defined as the firm’s ability to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure IT resources to support business strategies and work processes—underpins its competitive positioning in “rapidly evolving, intensely competitive” markets where “success depends heavily on our ability to accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant and useful products, services, and technologies to the marketplace in a timely manner.” The company acknowledges the need to “invest significant resources in research and development, including through acquisitions, in order to enhance our technology and our existing products and services, and introduce new products and services that people can easily and effectively use,” and to devote ongoing investments in machine learning, cloud offerings, hardware, and multi-device platform support. It describes revenues increasingly driven by mobile, programmatic, and new ad formats, by Google Cloud offerings and by sales of apps, digital content, and hardware, and notes that “non-advertising revenues” require IT-intensive support and generally carry higher costs. The availability and performance of its products—spanning search, YouTube, Android, Chrome, Google Maps, Google Play and other services—“depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems” including data centers, bandwidth, energy and equipment, which are subject to “damage or interruption from earthquakes, terrorist attacks, natural disasters … computer viruses, [and] denial of service attacks.” The company further states that “it expects to continue to expend significant resources to maintain state-of-the-art security protections” against cyber threats, system failures, employee error or malfeasance, and evolving privacy and regulatory regimes, underscoring that effective information management capability—providing data and information with “appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access”—is central to its operational flexibility, process optimization, and overall firm performance in a dynamic global environment.

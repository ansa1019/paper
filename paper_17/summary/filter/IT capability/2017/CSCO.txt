Cisco reports that it designs and sells a broad range of technologies across networking, security, collaboration and the cloud, describing its evolving intent-based technologies as constantly learning and adapting to provide customers with a highly secure, intelligent platform for their digital business. Many of its strategic initiatives and investments and its architectural approach are designed to enable the increased use of the network as the platform for automating, orchestrating, integrating, and delivering an ever-increasing array of IT-based products and services. In June 2017 it announced the Catalyst 9000 Series of switches as the initial foundation of its intent-based networking capabilities, and other current initiatives include a focus on security, the market transition related to digital transformation and IoT, the transition in cloud, and the move towards more programmable, flexible and virtual networks. The transformation of its business to deliver more software and subscription offerings where revenue is recognized over time underscores a shift in its delivery model, and over the last few years the company has been transforming its business to move from selling individual products and services to selling products and services integrated into architectures and solutions, offering them in the manner in which customers wish to consume them. Its strategy is to lead customers in their digital transition with solutions that deliver greater agility, productivity, security and other advanced network capabilities and that intelligently connect nearly everything that can be connected. It cautions that if it fails to introduce products related to network programmability, such as software-defined-networking products, in a timely fashion—or if product offerings that ultimately succeed are based on technology or an approach different from its own, such as networking products based on “white box” hardware—its business could be harmed. The enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies including computing, networking, storage and software, driven by factors such as highly scalable microprocessors, ASICs offering advanced services, standards-based protocols, cloud computing and virtualization. As programmability becomes more prevalent, the company expects to face increased competition from providers of commoditized hardware. The markets in which it competes are characterized by rapid change, converging technologies and a migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages.

The company acknowledges that “as we have grown, we have had to manage an increasingly large and more complex array of internal systems and processes to scale with all aspects of our business, including our hardware and software development, contract manufacturing, purchasing, logistics, fulfillment and maintenance and support,” and warns that “if we do not appropriately manage any future growth or are unable to improve our systems and processes, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will be adversely affected.”  It further states that “to manage domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting processes and procedures and implement more extensive and integrated financial and business information systems,” and cautions that “we may not be able to successfully implement these or other improvements to our systems and processes in an efficient or timely manner” and that “our systems and processes may not prevent or detect all errors, omissions or fraud,” any of which could cause “disruption of our current operations and end‐customer relationships, our inability to manage the growth of our business and our inability to accurately forecast our revenue, expenses and earnings and prevent certain losses.”  In addition, the company notes that “managing the supply of our products and product components is complex, and our inventory management systems and related supply‐chain visibility tools may not enable us to forecast accurately and manage effectively the supply of our products and product components.”  Finally, in its discussion of capital resources and liquidity, the company reports that “in order to support our strong growth, we have accelerated our investment in infrastructure, such as enterprise resource planning software and other technologies to improve the efficiency of our operations.”

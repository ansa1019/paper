UnitedHealth Group discloses that it leverages core competencies in “advanced, enabling technology; health care data; information and intelligence” and continually invests in “new clinical and administrative information and management systems” to support business strategies and work processes and to capitalize on growth opportunities in its Optum platform. The company acknowledges significant reliance on its information systems, noting that its “ability to price adequately our products and services, to provide effective service to our customers in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, and to report accurately our results of operations depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems,” and that periodic initiatives to “consolidate, integrate, upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities” require substantial resources to keep pace with changes in information processing technology, regulatory standards and customer preferences. UnitedHealth Group further warns that “connectivity among competing technologies is becoming increasingly important” and that software products it develops or installs may contain defects or interoperability issues that could disrupt operations. The company discloses extensive cybersecurity and data‐security risk management programs—“programs in place to detect, contain and respond to data security incidents” and employee training on phishing and malware—yet cautions that “experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our layered security controls” or exploit vulnerabilities in hardware, software or facilities, which could lead to “security breaches that disrupt our operations or result in the unintended dissemination of protected personal information,” litigation, regulatory enforcement, reputational harm and increased costs. It also recognizes that failure to comply with evolving privacy, security and data‐protection laws, including HITECH, HIPAA and the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, or to safeguard “proprietary rights to our databases, software and related products,” could constrain its business model, increase operating costs and impede its ability to market and sell information‐related services.

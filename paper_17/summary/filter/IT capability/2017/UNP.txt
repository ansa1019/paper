The Company discloses that “we rely on information technology in all aspects of our business,” cautioning that if it “do not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or if we are unable to develop or implement new technology such as PTC or the latest version of our transportation control systems, we may suffer a competitive disadvantage” that could materially harm operational efficiency, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. It further warns that “if a cyber attack or other event causes significant disruption or failure of one or more of our information technology systems, including computer hardware, software, and communications equipment, we could suffer a significant service interruption, safety failure, security breach, or other operational difficulties, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.” In its 2018 capital plan the Company “includes significant investments in technology improvements, including PTC,” and it allocates a portion of capital to “technology and other” projects. Within operating expenses, costs for “computer software,” “telephone and cellular,” and communications equipment are separately identified, underscoring technology expenditures as integral to supporting network operations, transportation planning, and customer service needs. The Company’s safety initiatives likewise embrace a “multi-faceted approach … utilizing technology, risk assessment, training and employee engagement, quality control, and targeted capital investments” to drive improved safety performance.

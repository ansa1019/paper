Starbucks’ information technology systems, such as those we use for our point-of-sale, web and mobile platforms—including online and mobile payment systems and rewards programs—and for administrative functions such as human resources, payroll, accounting and communications, as well as the IT systems of third-party partners, contain customer and employee personal, financial and proprietary information, including business plans and product development initiatives. We rely heavily on these interdependent systems across our operations—including supply chain management, Starbucks Cards, online business, mobile payments and ordering apps, loyalty functionality and various other processes and transactions—and the success of growth initiatives, including our priority to increase digital relationships with customers to drive incremental traffic and spend, depends significantly on the reliability, integrity and capacity of these systems. We continue to make significant investments in technology, third-party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and prevent or minimize breaches and data loss, yet we have experienced frequent attempts to compromise our IT systems, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure—caused by factors such as power outages, ineffective redundancy, flaws in third-party software or services, errors by employees or service providers, or cyber-attacks—could materially harm our ability to operate, damage our reputation and brand, and expose us to civil or criminal liability under domestic or international privacy laws, including the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation. Such breaches could result in significant capital expenditures for additional security technologies, personnel, experts and credit monitoring services, which could adversely impact our financial results. In fiscal 2017, operating margin compression was driven in part by increased partner and digital investments, reflecting our ongoing deployment of IT resources to support business strategies, work processes and digital capabilities, and in fiscal 2018, we intend to drive convenience and brand engagement through our mobile, loyalty and digital capabilities and accelerate the power and momentum of our digital platform.

The company discloses that “breaches or disruptions of our information technology systems or the systems of our customers, vendors and other third parties could … compromise our information technology networks; result in corrupt or lost data or the unauthorized release of our, our customers’ or our suppliers’ confidential or proprietary information; cause a disruption to our manufacturing and other operations; result in the release of personal data; or cause us to incur costs associated with increased protection, remediation or penalties,” any of which could adversely affect its operating results and reputation. It further acknowledges that “a breach of our suppliers’ information technology systems could result in a release of our confidential or proprietary information,” that “cybersecurity threats are frequent and constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of defending against them,” and that its global operations expose it to risks in “transportation, communications and information technology networks.” The company also describes its reliance on internal processes and information flows when it states that its “ability to match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill orders” and to “manufacture products based on forecasts of customers’ demands,” which are “based on multiple assumptions,” may affect its ability to meet revenue forecasts, implicitly underscoring the importance of maintaining accurate, timely and secure information management capabilities to coordinate assets, processes and interfirm transactions.

T-Mobile’s disclosures underscore that its ability to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure IT-based resources and internal processes is fundamental to supporting its competitive strategy and work-process efficiency, as evidenced by its ongoing investments in network coverage, speed and quality, expansion of network capacity to meet growing data demands and deployment of advanced technologies such as 5G.  The company relies heavily upon its internal systems and applications, and those of its third-party service providers, for critical functions including customer billing, credit checks, software development services and transaction processing, and acknowledges that any failures, interruptions or unauthorized access to these systems or to confidential information—whether arising from cyber-attacks, system failures, third-party supplier errors or regulatory compliance lapses—could materially impair service delivery, damage its reputation, compromise sensitive personal and proprietary data, disrupt its internal controls under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and adversely affect its financial reporting.  Recognizing the dynamic cyber-threat landscape, the company continually evaluates and revises its safeguards, contractual assurances and risk-management standards for network components and information security, while also acknowledging that unanticipated difficulties or delays in implementing its new billing system, or in migrating customers and devices to new platforms, could have material operational, financial and reputational consequences.

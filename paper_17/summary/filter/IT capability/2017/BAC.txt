Throughout the annual report, the Company emphasizes its dependency on, and evolution of, robust operational and security systems infrastructure, including its computer systems, data management platforms and internal processes, as well as third-party systems, as integral to its performance and its ability to support business activities and growth. The report discloses that technology project implementation challenges may cause business interruptions, and that updating systems to remain compliant with global legal and regulatory requirements entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones. It acknowledges reliance on backup systems and safeguards to support operations, while noting that backup systems may not process data as quickly as primary systems and that third-party backup capabilities are more limited. It warns that failures or breaches of its operational or security systems—or those of third parties—through events such as cyberattacks, system vulnerabilities, human error or infrastructure outages could disrupt transaction processing, impair risk management and expansion plans, expose confidential information and result in legal, financial and reputational harm. The Company highlights ongoing investment in its internet and mobile banking channels (supporting approximately 35 million active users of its leading digital platform, including 24 million mobile users and 16 thousand ATMs), and its development of remote connectivity solutions, while recognizing the challenges of continuously transmitting and storing sensitive customer and regulatory data with third parties and on outside devices. Finally, the report details the heightened significance of cybersecurity and control processes designed to protect systems, data and networks from attack, noting that emerging technologies, mobile-payment services, vendor consolidation, interconnectivity of financial institutions and evolving threats from disgruntled insiders, extremist groups or state actors are increasing operational and information- security risks to its franchises worldwide.

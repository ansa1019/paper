The company’s risk disclosures emphasize that the process of developing, acquiring and enhancing technology products and services is complex, costly and uncertain and that failure to anticipate rapidly changing customer requirements or adapt to emerging technological trends could impair competitive positioning. It identifies the need for long-term investments in infrastructure, intellectual property and IT systems to ensure product performance across evolving devices, platforms and operating systems, and to support integration of its offerings with third-party solutions in a complex ecosystem partly reliant on external data center and hosting services. Any interruption, capacity shortfall or failure in these data centers, network infrastructure or enterprise applications may disrupt data collection, storage and near-real-time delivery of accurate, timely and reliable information, breach service levels, compromise confidentiality, integrity or availability of customer and employee data, and expose the firm to liability and reputational harm. The company warns that hardware or software failures, insufficient infrastructure capacity planning, migration among data centers, or obsolescence of IT resources could result in data loss, corruption or inaccuracies, impair operational efficiency and its ability to support business needs. It describes substantial investments in engineering more secure products, enhancing security and reliability features, code hardening, rigorous penetration testing and improved incident-response measures while acknowledging that evolving attack techniques and security vulnerabilities cannot be fully eliminated. In its subscription and enterprise offerings, it highlights the criticality of robust IT architecture, software delivery methods, hosting services and the need for sales representatives to educate customers on technical capabilities, security features and return on investment. In management’s discussion, the company affirms that research and development investments—including recruitment of software developers and expansion of infrastructure capacity—are essential for timely development of new applications, process automation, scalability and sustained competitive advantage. Finally, it recognizes disaster-recovery planning, reliance on network and internal technology systems, and potential disruptions from catastrophic events or climate-related resource constraints as key factors affecting its ability to maintain organizational goals, business resilience and overall IT capability.

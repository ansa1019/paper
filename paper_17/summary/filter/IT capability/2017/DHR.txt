The Company discloses that it relies on information technology systems, including third-party managed platforms, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to support critical business processes such as order receipt and fulfillment, billing, payment collection, product shipping, customer service and contractual obligations, and that certain remote monitoring products and services incorporate software and IT functionality that houses personal data and may connect to corporate systems for maintenance or other purposes. It warns that these systems, products and services are subject to cyber-attacks, malware, ransomware, human error, power or hardware failures, telecommunications or utility disruptions, natural catastrophes and other unforeseen events, and that inadequate system redundancy or disaster recovery planning could prove ineffective, resulting in operational interruptions, delayed production and shipments, compromised product functionality, loss of data, diminished information reliability, impaired customer and partner relationships, legal claims, privacy-law penalties and damage to reputation and financial statements. The Company further emphasizes that, as a global enterprise, it must maintain reliable IT governance and security controls to comply with a complex matrix of data privacy and security laws and customer-imposed requirements—ranging from HIPAA and state breach-notification laws in the United States, through the EU General Data Protection Regulation and local data-localization rules in China and Russia—which may restrict cross-border data transfers and impose significant enforcement risks. In its strategic commentary, the Company states that it is making significant investments, both organically and through acquisitions, to address the rapid pace of technological change in its served markets—particularly in computing, automation, artificial intelligence, connectivity and digitization—and to globalize its manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources in order to improve operational efficiency, enhance responsiveness to changing business needs and market dynamics, leverage its IT and other organizational capabilities and strengthen its competitive position.

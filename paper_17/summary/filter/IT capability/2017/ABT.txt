Abbott’s risk disclosures underscore its reliance on sophisticated information technology systems for both infrastructure and product support, noting that the size and complexity of these systems make them susceptible to cyber attacks, malicious intrusion, system breakdown, data privacy breaches or other significant disruptions. To mitigate these risks, Abbott invests in its systems and technology and in the protection of its products and data, and continuously monitors its IT environment for current and emerging threats and changes in technology and regulatory requirements. Capital expenditures of approximately $1.1 billion annually have been directed in part to upgrades and expansions of manufacturing and R&D facilities, equipment and laboratory instruments, as well as investments in information technology. In its financial operations, Abbott employs information management capabilities—using internal and external data, historical trends and market research—to estimate rebates, inventory levels and other liabilities, recording and adjusting these reserves according to projected trends and program terms. Within its diagnostics segment, Abbott has launched the Alinity family of integrated next-generation diagnostic systems designed to increase laboratory efficiency by running more tests in less space, delivering results more rapidly, minimizing human error and maintaining quality data.

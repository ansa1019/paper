Costco relies extensively on information technology to process transactions, compile results, and manage its businesses, and failure or disruption of its primary and back-up systems—which are subject to power outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches or natural disasters—could materially interrupt business-critical operations and necessitate significant investments to restore or replace systems. The company is making and will continue to make significant technology investments to improve or replace critical information systems and processing capabilities, including information systems modernization projects—costs for which are reflected in increased depreciation and central operating expenses—and maintains change management processes designed to mitigate the risk of disruption when undertaking substantial system changes, although excessive technological change or suboptimal investment decisions could impede adoption, erode competitive positioning, and adversely impact financial performance. Given the high volume of transactions processed annually, maintaining uninterrupted operation of business-critical computer systems is vital to support member transactions—including membership fee deferrals recognized over one-year periods—and to maximize benefits from improved co-branded credit card arrangements, e-commerce growth, pharmacy operations and mobile and website platforms that address evolving multichannel retailing trends. The company accelerated vendor payments in advance of implementing its modernized accounting system, reflecting the organizational impact of large-scale information systems deployment on cash flows and operational controls. Costco also depends on third-party providers for payment transaction processing and secure transmission of encrypted confidential information over public networks, and any material interruption or security compromise could adversely affect operations, financial results and necessitate additional investments for information security, compliance and system enhancements.

Berkshire’s risk disclosures state that the company “relies on information technology in virtually all aspects of our business” and acknowledge that its IT systems “have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access, phishing efforts, denial-of-service attacks and other cyber attacks,” with expectations of more sophisticated and frequent attacks in the future. The company warns that “a significant disruption or failure of our information technology systems could result in service interruptions, safety failures, security violations, regulatory compliance failures, an inability to protect information and assets against intruders, and other operational difficulties,” and further observes that “attacks perpetrated against our information systems could result in loss of assets and critical information and expose us to remediation costs and reputational damage.” Although steps have been taken to mitigate these risks through “business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis,” the company cautions that a “significant disruption or cyber intrusion could lead to misappropriation of assets or data corruption and could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.” It also emphasizes that “if we are unable to acquire, implement or protect rights around new technology, we may suffer a competitive disadvantage,” and that cyber attacks “could further adversely affect our ability to operate facilities, information technology and business systems, or compromise confidential customer and employee information.”

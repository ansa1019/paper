Amgen’s filings describe a broad reliance on advanced information technology environments—from cloud-based platforms and network-connected control systems to enterprise data analytics, monitoring and communications infrastructure—that coordinate research, development, manufacturing, distribution and commercial operations both internally and with third-party partners. The company recognizes that its ability to acquire, deploy and reconfigure IT resources to provide timely, accurate and secure information across distributed systems is essential to support clinical trials, manufacturing processes, regulatory compliance, customer interactions and strategic decision-making, and that breakdowns, cyberattacks (including malware or denial-of-service attacks), unauthorized access or privacy breaches could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of critical data, disrupt operations and supply-chain coordination, expose intellectual property or personal and commercial information, impede agility and market responsiveness and damage its reputation. The report further highlights exposure to evolving global data-privacy and cybersecurity regulations—including GDPR and the California Consumer Privacy Act—and to risks associated with third-party service providers hosting or servicing its IT systems, noting that failures in security controls, vendor performance, compliance or alternative sourcing could lead to financial penalties, enforcement actions, operational delays or exclusion from government healthcare programs.

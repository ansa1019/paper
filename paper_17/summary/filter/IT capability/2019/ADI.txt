The company states that it relies on information technology systems throughout its operations to keep financial records and customer data, process orders, manage inventory, coordinate shipments, maintain confidential and proprietary information, assist semiconductor engineering and other technical activities, and operate critical functions such as internet connectivity, network communications and email, while also leveraging external cloud providers for certain infrastructure activities. It acknowledges that these information systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware or telecommunication failures, employee malfeasance or user errors, as well as security breaches caused by viruses, illegal break-ins, hacking, sabotage or third-party errors, and that a prolonged disruption or breach involving internal communications or interactions with customers or suppliers could lead to loss of sales, incremental costs and reputational damage. The company employs confidentiality agreements and information security practices to protect proprietary information shared with strategic partners, yet recognizes that such measures may not prevent unauthorized disclosure or misappropriation. It further notes that evolving regulations in areas such as cybersecurity, data protection and export controls in key markets like China, along with compliance requirements for U.S. government contracting, create additional governance and risk-management challenges that bear on the accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access of information and the firmâ€™s ability to effectively support business needs and maintain competitive advantage.

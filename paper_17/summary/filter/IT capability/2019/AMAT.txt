Applied discloses that risks associated with information technology capability include failures of information technology or infrastructure, including those of third-party suppliers or data hosting and telecommunications providers, which can disrupt manufacturing operations and supply chain processes. The company periodically implements enterprise resource planning and related information systems to better manage business operations, align global organizations and enable future growth, recognizing that such implementations require significant personnel, training and financial resources and that delays or difficulties may prevent realization of anticipated productivity improvements, cost efficiencies, and effective tracking of orders, inventory requirements, supply chain management, human resources allocation, financial data aggregation and operating result reporting. Applied collects, uses, transmits and stores confidential and personally identifiable data on its own and third-party information technology systems and devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption and related measures to protect against unauthorized access or misuse, acknowledging that cybersecurity threats ranging from employee error to advanced persistent threats could result in misappropriation of intellectual property, corruption or loss of critical data, business disruption, reputational harm, litigation and increased protection and remediation costs. Moreover, compliance with evolving privacy and information security laws and regulations may lead to significant expense and could result in regulatory proceedings or third-party claims if not effectively managed.

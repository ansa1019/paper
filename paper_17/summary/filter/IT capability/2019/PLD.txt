Prologis discloses that, despite having implemented system redundancy, security measures and a disaster-recovery plan for its internal and hosted information technology systems, those systems remain vulnerable to damages from energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, telecommunications failures, cyber-security attacks such as computer viruses or unauthorized access, any of which could materially disrupt operations, result in significant remediation costs, expose the company to privacy, legal and financial liabilities, damage its reputation and undermine stakeholder confidence; in addition, Prologis recognizes that the design and ongoing effectiveness of its disclosure controls, procedures and internal control over financial reporting are critical to ensuring accurate and timely financial information, and any deficiencies or material weaknesses in these control systems could lead to errors or misstatements in its financial statements, potential restatements, a decline in its securities’ market value and an erosion of competitive advantage by impairing operational reliability and the firm’s ability to coordinate its assets and processes.

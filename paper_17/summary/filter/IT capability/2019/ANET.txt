The risk factors describe how our business is critically dependent on the coordination and deployment of information technology resources across internal processes and interfirm relationships, noting that “the market demand for cloud networking solutions has increased in recent years as end customers have deployed larger, more sophisticated networks and have increased the use of virtualization and cloud computing,” and that “our business depends on the overall demand for information technology, network connectivity and access to data and applications.”  They emphasize the need to manage an “increasingly large and more complex array of internal systems and processes to scale with all aspects of our business, including our hardware and software development, contract manufacturing, purchasing, logistics, fulfillment and maintenance and support,” and warn that failure to “continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting processes and procedures and implement more extensive and integrated financial and business information systems” could impair our growth and competitive position.  They highlight the importance of our IT systems for virtually all business operations—“from our internal operations and product development activities to our marketing and sales efforts and communications with our customers and business partners”—and describe risks that our software and hardware technologies may contain defects or security vulnerabilities that “could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products,” “make the data systems of our customers vulnerable to further data loss,” or allow unauthorized access to sensitive business or customer information.  The disclosures also call out that disruptions to cybersecurity, whether from “sophisticated cyber attacks, the mishandling of data by employees and contractors” or failures in “third-party manufacturers, logistics providers or partners,” could “damage our ability to conduct our business operations,” degrade our “ability to process customer orders and electronically deliver products and services,” and harm our reputation and customer relationships.  Finally, they note that our products must interoperate with operating systems, applications and hardware developed by others, requiring continual software updates to preserve compatibility, and that any failure in interoperability or integration “may result in lost sales or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business.”

The company acknowledges that its competitive position and growth depend critically on its evolving technology capabilities, warning that its markets are “characterized by constant and rapid technological change, frequent introduction of new products and services, and increasing client expectations,” and that “failure to keep pace with technological change,” including innovations in point-of-sale technology or industry standards such as tokenization and security technologies, “could be materially adversely affected,” leading to client loss or inhibited growth. It emphasizes its reliance on the reliability and integrity of “processing and other systems,” including hardware, software, data, networks and information security controls, and cautions that unauthorized access, intrusion, denial-of-service or system disruptions—whether from cyberattacks, human error, software defects, power losses, natural disasters or other events—could “disrupt the integrity, continuity, security and trust of our systems or data,” trigger litigation, regulatory sanctions or reputational harm, and drive clients to competitors. The firm states it “expects to continue to invest significant resources to maintain and enhance our information security and controls or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities.” It also notes risks of “software defects, development delays or installation difficulties,” which “could result in interruption of business operations, delay in market acceptance, additional development and remediation costs, diversion of technical and other resources, loss of clients or client data, negative publicity or exposure to liability claims.” In its international operations it refers to “software development and technology hosting facilities” subject to geopolitical and operational risks. In its Management’s Discussion and Analysis, the company describes itself as a provider of “account processing systems; electronic payments processing products and services; internet and mobile banking systems; merchant transaction processing and acquiring; security, risk and fraud management products and services; and other electronic payments software and services,” and observes that the rising importance of digital channels and transaction volumes has “elevated the data and transaction processing needs of financial institutions,” requiring continued investment in “infrastructure, technology, products, services and networks” where “economies of scale … are essential to justify these investments.” Its revenue recognition policies further detail the treatment of “software license sales,” “customization, modification or production of software,” “hosted licensed software,” and hardware devices, illustrating the firm’s focus on delivering technology-based solutions that support business needs with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access.

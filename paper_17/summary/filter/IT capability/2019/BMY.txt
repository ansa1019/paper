In connection with the Celgene acquisition, we are in the process of integrating a large number of manufacturing, operational and administrative systems to achieve consistency throughout the combined company, including human capital management, portfolio rationalization, finance and accounting systems, sales operations and product distribution, pricing systems and methodologies, data security systems, compliance programs and internal controls processes. Through our operating model transformation aimed at streamlining general and administrative, manufacturing, R&D, procurement and the company’s pricing and information technology infrastructure, we anticipate realizing $2.5 billion of synergies. We rely extensively on information technology systems, networks and services—including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools, physical security systems and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third-party vendors—to conduct our business, and a significant breakdown, invasion, corruption, destruction or interruption of these critical systems or infrastructure could negatively impact operations. The company’s digital infrastructure faces evolving cybersecurity threats such as industrial espionage attacks, malware and other cyber-attacks that may compromise system infrastructure or lead to data leakage, either internally or at third-party providers, and although we have invested in industry-appropriate protections and monitoring practices of our data and IT, maintain cyber insurance and continuously monitor our systems, there can be no assurance these measures will prevent breakdowns or breaches. We also depend on third-party suppliers, vendors, outsourcing partners, alliance partners and other third parties to provide various business unit and functional services—including marketing, selling, human resources, finance, IT and other services—and the failure of any critical third party to meet contractual, regulatory or other obligations, or disagreements that could cause delays in or termination of research, development or commercialization activities, could materially adversely impact our operations and results. In addition, our operations are subject to new and increasing data privacy regulations and enforcement—particularly the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation—and any failure to comply with such requirements could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.

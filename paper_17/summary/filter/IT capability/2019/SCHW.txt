Our operations are highly dependent on the integrity and performance of our technology systems and our ability to make timely enhancements and additions to those systems to process, record and monitor the large number of transactions we handle, and system interruptions, errors or downtime—from changes in client use patterns, technological failures, software flaws, capacity constraints, linkages with third-party systems or power outages—can have a significant impact on our business and operations, potentially delaying or mis-executing client transactions and exposing us to losses and client claims. Although we devote substantial attention and resources to ensuring the reliability, capacity, scalability and security of our systems, extraordinary trading volumes may still cause our computer systems to operate at unacceptably slow speeds or fail, and our systems and those of other financial institutions continue to be targets of cyber attacks, malicious code, computer viruses and denial-of-service attacks, with potential unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data, service unavailability, and significant liability or reputational harm. Despite our efforts to implement effective preventive measures, protective controls and monitoring, security breaches—whether technical or resulting from non-technical means such as employee misconduct—and external fraud involving misappropriation of user credentials may occur and require significant additional resources to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities. We also rely on external service providers for key technology, processing, servicing and support functions and remain exposed to operational disruption, inefficiencies and transition challenges if these providers experience failures. Furthermore, we depend on the integrity and performance of securities exchanges, clearing houses and other intermediaries whose system failures or transaction errors could cause erroneous or unanticipated execution prices, substantial losses and client dissatisfaction. Regulatory and market changes, including the expected phase-out of LIBOR and new legislation governing electronic commerce, client privacy and data security, may require extensive operational work to transition systems and financial models and to make necessary changes to our technology infrastructure, compliance, risk management, treasury and operations functions. Reflecting our focus on building and leveraging technology capabilities, capitalized costs for developing internal-use software totaled $165 million in 2019, and we expect to continue investing in technology projects to support operational flexibility, resilience and future growth.

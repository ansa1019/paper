We are continuing to rapidly and significantly expand our global operations, including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses, and the complexity of the current scale of our business can place significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions. These offerings, which can present new and difficult technology challenges, may subject us to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues, and changes in usage or adoption rates of the internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and web services continue to impact our business. The timing, effectiveness, and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure affect our operations, as does the ability of network operators between our customers and our stores to grant unimpaired and unconstrained access to our online services. The extent to which use of our services is affected by spyware, viruses, phishing, denial of service attacks, data theft, computer intrusions, outages, and similar events could adversely affect our performance, and some of our systems have experienced past security breaches. We and our third-party co-sourcers rely on technology infrastructure in diverse jurisdictions, including third-party technology and systems for encryption and authentication, employee email, content delivery to customers, back-office support, and other functions, and in certain markets limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure may constrain our operations. We provide technology services in China through contractual relationships with PRC-licensed third parties, and we face risks related to successfully optimizing and operating our fulfillment network and data centers, since failures to predict customer demand or to operate our fulfillment network and data centers efficiently can result in excess or insufficient capacity, increased costs, and impairment charges. Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays, and loss of critical data, preventing us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services, and our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content, including AWS and the expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, and in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve process efficiencies; advances in processing power, wireless connectivity, artificial intelligence, and machine learning will continue to improve the consumer experience on the internet, and to take advantage of these advances we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices. Technology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services in our online stores, and infrastructure costs, including servers, networking equipment, and data center-related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses, and steps we take to add software and hardware, upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and improve the stability and efficiency of our systems may not be sufficient to avoid interruptions or delays that could adversely affect our operating results.

Goldman Sachs’ businesses are highly dependent on information technology services, requiring continuous updates to operational systems and infrastructure to process and monitor large volumes of highly complex transactions across diverse markets and currencies and to support electronic reporting and client order management in real time. The firm invests heavily in systemic controls, training and capital projects to implement enhancements and updates—including integration of new businesses and the growth of digital platforms such as its Marcus online lending and deposit service—and seeks to mobilize computing devices, phones, cloud technologies, and distributed ledger technology while managing associated security, resilience and integration risks. In addition, the firm’s operational risk management framework recognizes the criticality of secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential information in its own and third-party networks and emphasizes proactive deployment of protective measures to guard against cyber attacks, inherent system defects and evolving vulnerabilities such as hardware flaws in computing devices, including those provided by employees, and the associated challenges of integrating new systems with legacy platforms. Bulk reliance on technology and increasing interconnectivity mandate incident-response procedures, business resilience planning and rapid remediation to limit the impact of systems disruptions or human error on markets, clients, counterparties and Goldman Sachs itself.

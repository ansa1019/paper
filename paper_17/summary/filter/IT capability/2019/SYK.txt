Stryker discloses that the Company relies extensively on information technology systems, networks and services—including internet sites, cloud and SaaS solutions, data hosting and processing facilities, tools, hardware, software, technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted or provided by third parties—to conduct its business, and that a failure of a key information technology system, process or site or a breach of information security, including a cybersecurity breach or failure of one or more key IT systems, networks, processes, associated sites or service providers, could impair the confidentiality, availability and integrity of its data and product offerings and expose the Company to reputational, competitive and business harm, litigation and regulatory action; while the Company has made investments to address these risks through monitoring of networks and systems, hiring of experts, employee training and security policies for employees and third-party providers, it recognizes that evolving cybersecurity threats and the techniques used in attacks may be difficult to detect or anticipate, and business continuity plans may not effectively address these failures on a timely basis. The Company further identifies that an inability to successfully manage the design, implementation and integration of its new global enterprise resource planning system—an undertaking that will replace many of its existing operating and financial systems and represents a major management and personnel investment—could disrupt its ability to process orders, ship products, provide services and customer support, send invoices, track payments, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate its business. In addition, Stryker is subject to a variety of global laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection and data security—including Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation, which imposes new requirements on the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, security and confidentiality of personally identifiable healthcare information and carries significant penalties for non-compliance—that are broad in scope, subject to evolving interpretation and may require the Company to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter its practices.

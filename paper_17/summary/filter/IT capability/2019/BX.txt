Blackstone’s risk disclosures emphasize that its operations are highly dependent on its information systems and technology, including financial, accounting, communications and other data‐processing systems that, if compromised by tampering or network security breaches, could fail to operate properly or become disabled; that cyberattacks and other security threats—originating from cyber criminals, nation‐state hackers, insiders or third-party service providers—pose heightened risks of data loss, business interruptions, reputational damage, regulatory intervention, increased costs and financial losses; that the firm has become increasingly reliant on third-party administrators and cloud-based services, which themselves face ongoing cybersecurity threats and could expose Blackstone to unauthorized access of confidential information; that cybersecurity has become a top priority for regulators globally, with laws such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, as well as breach notification requirements, imposing significant compliance burdens and enforcement risks; that Blackstone and its portfolio companies depend on secure processing, storage and transmission of sensitive data, including payment and health information; that failures to comply with evolving global privacy and cybersecurity regulations—often extraterritorial in scope—could result in substantial penalties, litigation, enforcement actions and reputational harm; and that developments in financial technology, including distributed ledger technology or blockchain, have the potential to disrupt financial markets, transform how asset managers operate and require continuous investment in technology infrastructure, governance and change management to maintain operational resilience and competitive advantage.

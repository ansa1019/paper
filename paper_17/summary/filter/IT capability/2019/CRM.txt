The company’s disclosures emphasize that its ability to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure IT resources in support of business strategies and work processes depends on the coordination of its internally built and third-party-provided infrastructure—from data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platforms, network connectivity and hardware to proprietary and licensed software—and that breaches, vulnerabilities or disruptions in any of these systems can impair information reliability, security, timeliness, confidentiality and access, damage customer relationships, impede competitive positioning and require significant resource mobilization to remediate. It notes that early adoption of new digital technologies and continuous enhancements and updates add complexity to its IT architecture and increase operational risk, while integrations of acquired technologies and data transfer across multiple facilities and global networks may lead to system degradation, migration failures and performance outages. To manage these risks, the company invests in expanding data center capacity, upgrading internal IT systems, strengthening business and data governance policies, enhancing security controls, escalating cybersecurity events to its board and committees, and deploying disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements, yet acknowledges that evolving regulations such as GDPR, CCPA and cross-border data transfer restrictions may demand further compliance investments, process redesign and resource allocation. In its management discussion, the company describes its customer 360 platform—uniting CRM, analytics, AI, mobile, social, blockchain and voice—underpinned by ongoing investments in development and test environments, personnel capability and technology infrastructure to deliver subscription-based cloud services and term or perpetual software licenses, reflecting the centrality of IT capability in driving business innovation, operational flexibility, strategic resource deployment and value creation across its global value chain.

We have developed and deployed software updates for the 737 MAX, together with an associated pilot training and supplementary education program, addressing questions on how pilots interact with airplane controls and displays in different flight scenarios; we maintain an extensive network of technical security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms, monitoring systems and management oversight to prevent, detect and respond to unauthorized activity in our data and systems; we manage information and information technology systems for certain customers, providing confidentiality, availability and integrity protections for classified or personally identifiable information; we continue to work with regulatory authorities to certify software functionality and interface design, and to tailor our technology solutions and support processes in response to evolving safety, operational and customer requirements; and we recognize that failures in information security or system reliability could cause significant financial losses, reputational harm or regulatory penalties.

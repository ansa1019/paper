Alphabet’s business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, requiring that it accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant and useful products, services, and technologies in a timely manner, which in turn demands continued investment in research and development (including through acquisitions) to enhance its technology and new and existing products and services. Within Google, the company continues to invest heavily in hardware, including smartphones and home devices, and allocates significant resources to develop and deploy enterprise-ready cloud services, including Google Cloud Platform and G Suite, incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services and hire talent to scale its cloud salesforce. Continuing shifts to an online world and the multi-device economy have driven growth in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices, and have led to expanding advertising products and monetization formats across multiple platforms, where paid clicks and impressions are influenced by interrelated factors such as device mix, geographic mix, ad formats, delivery improvements, and partner agreements, while the company’s ability to create a seamless experience for both users and advertisers remains critical to maintaining competitiveness. The company relies extensively on information systems and technology to manage its business, summarize operating results, and maintain its global enterprise resource planning system, which is designed to accurately maintain financial records, enhance the flow of financial information, improve data management, and provide timely information to management, but complications in design or implementation could harm business operations. Interruption, interference with, or failure of its information technology and communications systems from power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, ransomware attacks, or natural disasters could delay data center upgrades, impair service availability, hinder restoration efforts, and harm reputation, financial condition, and operating results; some systems are not fully redundant, and disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. The company’s products and services involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information, and software bugs, security breaches, and vulnerabilities could result in improper disclosure of user data, litigation, and other potential liabilities; accordingly, it expends significant resources to maintain security protections, combat cyber attacks and web spam through proprietary indexing technology, and undertake safety, security, and content review efforts, continually evolving its security and privacy practices in response to regulatory requirements and user expectations. Additionally, the company depends on third parties to manufacture assemblies and components for its technical infrastructure and products, and any inability to engage such providers with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms or supply chain disruptions could negatively affect its operations. To sustain long-term growth, Alphabet invests heavily in land and buildings for data centers and offices, information technology infrastructure including servers and network equipment, and continues to expand its offerings through Google Play, hardware, YouTube subscriptions, and other services, underscoring the critical role of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with other capabilities to support business strategies and maintain competitive advantage.

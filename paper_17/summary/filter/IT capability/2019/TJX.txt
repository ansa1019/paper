TJX notes that the growing size, scale and autonomy of its multi-banner, global operations places increasing pressure on its “systems (including information technology systems)” and heightens the risk that its “systems, controls, practices and policies may not be implemented effectively or consistently” or that “business information is not shared effectively” across operations. The company states that “compromises of our data security, disruptions in our information technology systems, or failure to satisfy the information technology needs of our business could result in material loss or liability, materially impact our operating results or materially harm our reputation.” It relies “heavily on information technology systems, including those of suppliers and service providers, to manage all key aspects of our business, including planning, purchasing, sales, supply chain management, inventory management, point-of-sale processing, e-commerce, human resources, financial management, communications, safeguarding information, and compliance with legal obligations,” and maintains that ongoing operations and successful growth depend on “accurately anticipat[ing] our current and future information technology needs and successfully develop[ing], implement[ing] and maintain[ing] appropriate systems” along with “related back-up systems.” TJX emphasizes that its IT infrastructure and that of its partners is targeted by increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks and may be disrupted by “power outages, system failures, catastrophic events, or employee inadvertence,” and that “any successful compromise or disruption of our information technology systems could result in material reputational harm and impact our customers’ willingness to shop in our stores or online and/or our suppliers’ willingness to do business with us.” To mitigate these risks, the company “maintains policies, procedures and controls designed to reduce the risk of data security compromises and information technology failures or disruptions,” has “implemented measures … since the unauthorized intrusions into our network discovered late in 2006,” and invests “costly and ongoing” resources in technologies, hiring, training and compliance. It further cautions of “material business disruption, liability and reputational damage associated with ongoing actions intended to update, enhance, modify or replace our systems and infrastructure” from challenges such as “not accurately capturing and maintaining data, efficiently testing and implementing changes, realizing the expected benefit of the change and managing the potential disruption … and diversion of internal teams’ attention.” Finally, it notes that meeting rapidly evolving consumer expectations “through various digital platforms” and identifying “the right investments at the right time and with the right speed” are critical to its financial results.

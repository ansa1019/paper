Nee and FPL are highly dependent on their sensitive and complex information technology systems and network infrastructure, and any failure, breach or disabling event affecting those systems—whether due to operator error, severe weather, terrorist act, cyber incident or third-party capacity constraints—could compromise sensitive confidential and other data and render them unable to fulfill critical business functions such as generating, purchasing or transmitting power or gas, billing customers and processing payments, monitoring and tracking a very large number of highly complex transactions across diverse markets, or timely filing required regulatory reports. The companies operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continuous functioning of sophisticated IT systems to process and monitor daily transactions, and they regularly add, modify and replace information systems, integrating new or replacement systems with existing processes, accounting procedures and controls and ensuring accurate data conversion; any disruptions or deficiencies in these system changes could result in increased costs, inability to collect or track revenues, diversion of management resources, erosion of control effectiveness or delays in capital improvement and regulatory reporting. Their retail businesses require access to sensitive customer data that may be shared with vendors or service providers, and a significant breach could diminish customer confidence, harm their reputation, expose them to fines or legal claims and interrupt their ability to pursue business and market opportunities. Moreover, the companies’ exposure to cyber-attacks and other disruptive activities includes not only physical generation, transmission, distribution and fuel storage facilities but also the underlying information technology infrastructure; such events could materially increase costs to repair or enhance security, impair their risk management and trading activities, and jeopardize their ability to raise capital, all of which underscore the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with other organizational capabilities to support and enhance their business strategies and work processes.

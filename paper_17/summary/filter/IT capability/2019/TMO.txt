Competitive factors cited by the company expressly include e-business capabilities alongside technological innovation, price, service and delivery, breadth of product line and the ability to meet the special requirements of customers, underscoring the importance of information technology in maintaining competitive advantage.  The company acknowledges that it must develop new products, adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of new products by competitors to remain competitive, with its growth strategy calling for significant investment in and expenditures for product development.  As part of its ongoing effort to upgrade its current information systems, the company periodically implements new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of its business operations, but warns that unforeseen problems could disrupt its ability to provide quotes, take customer orders and otherwise run its business in a timely manner, and that upgrades or changes in systems may cause interruptions in service, loss of data or reduced functionality or fail to provide accurate pricing and cost data, any of which could adversely affect results of operations and cash flows.  The company further discloses that it relies on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information—including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data—and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities such as interacting with suppliers, selling products and services, fulfilling orders and billing, collecting and making payments, shipping products, providing customer support, tracking customer activity and fulfilling contractual obligations.  It cautions that these systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, cyber-attacks, computer hackers, viruses, ransomware, phishing, denial-of-service attacks, unauthorized access to data or trade secrets, and other attempts to harm its systems, that certain systems are not redundant and disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality, and that any of these events could materially interrupt operations, delay production and shipments, result in theft of its or its customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets, damage customer, partner and employee relationships, give rise to legal claims and proceedings, incur liability and privacy-law penalties or drive up costs for security and remediation, each of which could adversely affect the business and financial results.  The company also warns that if it is unable to maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls to meet global data privacy and security requirements and to prevent data breaches, it may suffer regulatory as well as business consequences, noting stringent requirements under laws such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation, local state breach and security rules in the United States and foreign data localization and transfer restrictions.

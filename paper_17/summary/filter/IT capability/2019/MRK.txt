The company acknowledges an increasing dependence on sophisticated software applications and complex information technology systems and computing infrastructure (collectively, “IT systems”) to conduct critical operations, with certain systems managed, hosted or provided by third parties, and warns that disruption, degradation or manipulation of these IT systems—whether intentional or accidental, including cyber-attacks on its or third-party cloud-based systems—could expose confidential information, modify critical data and impair key business processes, or result in the theft of trade secrets, intellectual property or sensitive personal information. Following a 2017 network cyber-attack that disrupted worldwide manufacturing, research and sales operations, the company has implemented measures to further enhance and modernize its systems, is pursuing an enterprise-wide effort to improve resiliency and recovery speed during disruptions, and continuously monitors data, information technology and personnel usage for threats; yet it concedes there can be no assurance these safeguards will prevent future operational, financial, legal or reputational harm or substantial remediation costs. The animal health segment highlights an extensive suite of digitally connected identification, traceability and monitoring products, bolstered by the acquisition of Antelliq Group—a leader in digital animal identification solutions—while the healthcare services segment provides engagement, health analytics and clinical services and has shifted its investment approach toward venture capital stakes in third-party digital ventures. The company further recognizes that the inappropriate or unauthorized use of social media and evolving digital channels—including dissemination of promotional materials—could cause brand damage, information leakage or legal implications, that internal social media policies may not fully secure non-public sensitive information, and that identifying new points of entry as digital media expand presents ongoing challenges, all within a regulatory environment of emerging data privacy laws and security breach notification requirements in the United States and the European Union.

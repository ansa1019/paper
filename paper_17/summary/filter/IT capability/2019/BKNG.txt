The company acknowledges that its rapid global expansion and the corresponding increases in transaction volumes and product offerings place significant demands on its information technology infrastructure and organizational processes, noting that “current and planned employees, systems, procedures and controls may not be adequate to support and effectively manage this growth and increased complexity,” particularly across multiple geographic locations and diverse payment systems. In this context, it warns that “the implementation of new information technology, payment, enterprise resource planning (ERP) or other systems could be disruptive and/or costly” and that it may experience “difficulty successfully integrating new systems into existing systems or migrating to new systems from existing systems,” any of which could “adversely affect our business and results of operations.” The business has experienced “rapid growth in consumer traffic to our online platforms, the number of accommodations on our extranets and the geographic breadth of our operations,” and concedes that its systems must be “expanded to cope with increased demand” or risk “unanticipated disruptions in service, slower response times, decreased customer service and customer satisfaction and delays in the introduction of new services.” As an online enterprise, it is “dependent on the internet and maintaining connectivity between ourselves and consumers, sources of internet traffic, such as Google, and our travel service providers and restaurants,” and stresses that internet access disruptions—including “denial-of-service attacks,” telecommunication failures or capacity constraints—“could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.” The company relies on “both internally-developed systems and third-party systems to operate our services, including transaction processing, order management and financial and accounting systems,” and records significant information technology expenses for “software license and system maintenance fees; outsourced data center and cloud computing costs; payments to contractors; and data communications and other expenses associated with operating our services.” It also recognizes that “technical innovation often results in bugs, vulnerabilities and other system failures,” that “computer circumvention capabilities, new discoveries or advances or other developments … could result in a compromise or breach of consumer data,” and that despite substantial investments in security measures, “existing security measures may not be successful in preventing security breaches,” which “could result in severe damage to our information technology infrastructure” and exposure to “liability, regulatory penalties and sanctions.” The company views enhancing “payments capabilities, including by offering alternative payment solutions to consumers,” as “critical,” yet notes that evolving standards such as the European Union’s Payment Services Directive 2 and payment card industry security requirements create “additional complexity and burdens” and that failure to integrate preferred payment methods could “limit our growth opportunities.” Finally, it affirms that consumer migration to mobile devices and apps makes it “increasingly important … to effectively offer our services on mobile devices through mobile apps and mobile-optimized websites” and that significant resources must be devoted to “maintaining, developing and enhancing our mobile platforms and other technologies,” adapting to “rapidly changing technologies,” and executing “change management” processes to meet evolving consumer expectations and maintain competitive positioning.

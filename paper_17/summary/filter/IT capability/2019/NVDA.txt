Nvidia discloses that system security and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, have become more prevalent and sophisticated, and that these evolving threats have occurred on its systems and are expected to continue, making it increasingly difficult to defend against them or implement adequate preventive measures. Experienced programmers, hackers and employees may penetrate security controls to misappropriate or compromise confidential information, creating system disruptions or shutdowns, and developers of malicious software may exploit vulnerabilities in its products—including those enabled by over-the-air updates. Nvidia notes that for portions of its IT infrastructure, including business management and communication software, it relies on third-party products and services that themselves may be breached, and that data security breaches can also result from non-technical actions by insiders. To defend against these security threats, both for its internal systems and those of its customers, Nvidia must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features, potentially increasing expenses, though such efforts may not be successful. The company warns that actual or perceived breaches, accidental loss or disclosure of proprietary, sensitive or confidential data could expose Nvidia and affected parties to litigation, regulatory inquiries, liability, reputational harm and increased expenses, and that service interruptions, delays or cessations could impair order fulfillment and critical functions. It acknowledges vulnerability of its worldwide operations and data center capacity to telecommunications failures, power or water shortages, cloud service outages, natural disasters, information technology system failures and other disruptions, and recognizes that catastrophic events impacting third-party infrastructure service providers for its IT and R&D systems could harm its business. In addition, Nvidia highlights that privacy concerns related to handling personal data under evolving security and privacy laws, such as the EU’s GDPR, may expose it to fines, compliance costs and reputational damage. The company further discloses reliance on third-party software development tools to design, simulate and verify products and enhancements, noting that past delays and potential loss of design cycles or design wins due to tool limitations could reduce market share and revenue. Finally, Nvidia states that it continues to invest considerable resources in developing the infrastructure needed to scale its business—encompassing customer service, support, compliance and technical, financial and marketing investments—to meet evolving market and technology requirements.

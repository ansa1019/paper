In rapidly changing economic and technological environments characterized by evolving standards in computer hardware and software development, communications infrastructure and delivery models, our success depends on the ability to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure IT resources in support of business strategies and work processes, including the coordination of products and services across on-premise, cloud, hybrid and IaaS/SaaS deployment models. We continue to refresh our cloud portfolio with offerings such as the Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse Cloud Service, delivering machine learning-based automation, guaranteed uptime and significant cost efficiencies while addressing shifting customer demands for connectivity, scalability, information accuracy, timeliness and security. Our Oracle Cloud Strategy requires optimizing infrastructure capabilities, integrating acquired technologies, transitioning existing workloads, and ensuring rapid market acceptance through agile product development, process redesign and organizational agility. We operate our own cloud and business operations on Oracle products and networks, investing heavily in information management capabilities—data protection, confidentiality, encryption, access control and regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR, CCPA)—to safeguard against cyber-attacks, software vulnerabilities, third-party threats and operational disruptions. Recognizing the central role of IT capability as a strategic resource, we have committed resources to boosting security controls, monitoring systems and IT governance to mitigate potential performance impacts, support digital transformation, mobilize resources effectively and sustain competitive positioning in a dynamic business environment.

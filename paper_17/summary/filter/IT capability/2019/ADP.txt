The Company emphasizes its reliance on and ongoing management of information technology resources and processes, noting that “we rely heavily on our payroll, financial, accounting, and other data processing systems” and must “properly manage our systems, applications and solutions, and any upgrades, enhancements and expansions” to ensure effective support of its businesses. It maintains disaster recovery, business continuity and crisis management plans yet acknowledges that such plans “may not be successful in preventing or mitigating the loss of client data, service interruptions or disruptions to our operations.” The firm hosts critical applications in both internally operated and third-party data centers and warns that any failure or disruption “even for a limited period of time” could have a materially adverse effect. It devotes “significant resources to maintain and regularly update our systems and processes” to safeguard personal and business information and client funds and has programs “in place to prevent, detect and respond to data or cyber security incidents,” while recognizing that evolving threats and sophisticated attack techniques may outpace its preventive or responsive measures. Hardware, software or third-party applications may contain “defects in design or manufacture,” and unauthorized parties may use social engineering to introduce malware. Although the Company maintains insurance designed to address certain data and cyber risks, it concedes such coverage “may be insufficient to cover all losses” in this continually evolving area. The report further highlights sustained investments “in highly strategic areas and technology” to strengthen its business model, the introduction of next-generation platforms and strategic cloud-based human capital management solutions, and compliance initiatives such as binding corporate rules under GDPR to enable secure cross-border data transfers, all of which collectively reflect its evolving information management capability and dedication to transforming and coordinating its IT resources in support of business strategies and operational flexibility.

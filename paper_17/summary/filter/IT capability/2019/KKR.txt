We rely heavily on our financial, accounting and other data-processing systems and on third-party systems that support transaction execution, confirmation, settlement, recording and fund accounting, recognizing that our public markets, capital markets and private markets businesses are highly dependent on the ability to process and evaluate transactions across markets and geographies in a time-sensitive, efficient and accurate manner.  We depend on secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks and face ongoing cyber-security threats, errors, outages or capacity constraints that could impair operational efficiency, disrupt business innovation, compromise information reliability, confidentiality and connectivity or expose us to liability.  We have instituted business continuity and disaster recovery programs to address potential technology infrastructure disruptions, but these may not prove sufficient to mitigate the impacts of system failures, disasters or cyber-security breaches, and insurance or other safeguards may not fully reimburse us for resulting losses.  Our information management capability therefore underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with other organizational assets, while ensuring that information requirements, data management, technology governance and process optimization keep pace with the firmâ€™s growth, evolving product strategies and regulatory expectations concerning data privacy, cyber-security and third-party risk.

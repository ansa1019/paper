PepsiCo continues to invest in and incorporate technology and digital tools across all areas of our business, including the use of data analytics to enhance our ability to effectively market to consumers, to create more relevant and personalized experiences in digital environments or through digital devices in otherwise physical settings, and to develop new commercial insights; this comprehensive transformation initiative leverages digital technologies and artificial intelligence to reengineer our manufacturing, commercial and corporate operations and brand management, including the migration of financial processing and other systems to enterprise-wide solutions. We depend on information systems and technology, some of which are provided by third parties, including public websites and cloud-based services, for critical activities such as interfacing with customers and consumers, marketing, operation effectiveness, procurement and inventory management, facility operations, research and development, financial recordkeeping, regulatory compliance and global communications, and we have entered into shared services arrangements for IT support in functions such as payroll processing, benefits administration and finance and accounting; if we fail to allocate or manage the resources necessary to build and sustain our IT infrastructure, if we fail to timely deliver or train on new applications, or if our third-party service providers do not perform effectively, the resulting business disruption, data integrity compromises or transaction errors could impair our ability to attract and retain customers and consumers and reduce revenue. To address escalating cyber threats, we devote significant resources to network security, backup and disaster recovery, enhanced internal controls, vendor oversight and employee training, and our board periodically reviews cybersecurity risks and mitigation strategies; although no cyberattack or service failure has materially affected our business to date, the constantly evolving nature of these threats and increasing reliance on mobile and cloud platforms heightens the operational, regulatory and reputational risks associated with our IT capabilities.

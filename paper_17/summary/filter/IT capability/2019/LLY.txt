Our disclosures emphasize that our information technology systems and infrastructure are fundamental to coordinating internal processes, intellectual property protection, clinical trial management, regulatory compliance, manufacturing operations and interfirm relationships by enabling the accumulation, processing, storage and transmission of large volumes of confidential information, including trade secrets, strategic plans, marketing and patient data.  We acknowledge that these systems, as integral components of our business strategies and work processes, are vulnerable to system inadequacies, operating failures, service interruptions, security breaches, malicious intrusions and cyber-attacks—such as malware deployment, denial-of-service attacks and social engineering—whether arising from employee misconduct, third-party partners, competitors, hostile actors or certain governments.  We further recognize that evolving global laws and regulations governing privacy, data protection and data security impose additional requirements on the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and data.  Breaches or failures of our IT systems, or those of our outsourced service providers for functions such as clinical trials, product distribution and financial transactions, could impair our ability to maintain and defend intellectual property rights, disrupt manufacturing or distribution, damage customer relationships or reputation, expose personally identifiable information to unauthorized disclosure, and result in significant legal, regulatory or financial harm.  While we maintain cyber liability insurance and have implemented measures to protect, detect, respond to and enhance the resiliency of our IT systems, we recognize that these controls may not be successful in fully mitigating such risks or preventing material adverse impacts on our operations.

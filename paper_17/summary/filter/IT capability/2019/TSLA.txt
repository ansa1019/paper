The company is continuously expanding and improving its information technology systems, deploying new internally developed solutions across global operations—including systems for product data management, procurement, inventory management, production planning and execution, sales, service and logistics, dealer management, and financial, tax and regulatory compliance—and maintains IT measures designed to protect against intellectual property theft, data breaches and cyber-attacks. It relies on complex IT systems in its vehicles and energy storage products, which feature built-in data connectivity to receive remote software updates, and acknowledges that software defects, latent errors or unauthorized control or manipulation of its networks and products could disrupt manufacturing execution, data management, reporting of financial results, internal control processes, supply chain operations and customer servicing, harm its reputation and give rise to legal claims. The company further recognizes the significant management time, support and cost required to implement, maintain, segregate and update core IT applications and notes that failures in these efforts could impair its ability to mobilize and leverage IT-based resources in support of business strategies and work processes, accurately and timely report its financial results, achieve and maintain compliance with evolving privacy and consumer protection laws such as GDPR and CCPA, protect customer personal information, and safeguard its intellectual property, any of which could materially impact its operations, brand and financial condition.

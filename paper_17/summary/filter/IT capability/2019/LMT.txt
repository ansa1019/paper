The most direct reference to developments in information technology appears in our discussion of the F-35 program’s current challenges, which explicitly include “software development” as a key risk area in coordinating performance, schedule and cost under that complex, multi-partner effort. In describing our ongoing investments, we note that the majority of our 2019 and planned 2020 capital expenditures support both equipment and facilities infrastructure across our four business segments and “enterprise information technology infrastructure,” including the costs to develop or purchase “internal-use software,” underscoring the critical role of IT systems in sustaining our engineering, manufacturing and program management processes. Within our Rotary and Mission Systems segment, we further highlight the provision of cybersecurity services and “communication and command and control capabilities through complex mission solutions,” reflecting the integration of digital technologies to enhance situational awareness and support for defense applications. Although these references do not fully articulate a discrete “IT capability” framework, they demonstrate our reliance on software development, information management, cybersecurity and IT infrastructure investments to support business needs, secure competitive positioning and enable the coordination of internal processes and external relationships across government and international programs.

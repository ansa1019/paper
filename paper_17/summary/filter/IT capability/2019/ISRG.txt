Disruption of critical information systems or material breaches in the security of our systems could harm our business, customer relations, and financial condition. Information technology helps us operate efficiently, interface with customers, maintain financial accuracy and efficiency, and accurately produce our financial statements. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, loss of customers, business disruptions, or loss or damage to intellectual property through security breach. If our data management systems do not effectively collect, store, process, and report relevant data for the operation of our business—whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies, or human error—our ability to plan, forecast, execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations will be impaired, perhaps materially. Our business requires us to use and store customer, employee, and business partner personally identifiable information and to require user names and passwords for access to our information technology systems, supported by encryption and authentication technologies to secure data transmission and storage. These security measures may be compromised by unauthorized persons through hacking or phishing, employee error or malfeasance, faulty password management, or vendor system defects, any of which could result in the loss of data, risk to patient safety, product recall or field action, unplanned service interruptions, reputational harm, litigation exposure, and material adverse impacts on our operations, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. We have programs in place to detect, contain, and respond to data security incidents and make ongoing improvements to our information-sharing products to minimize vulnerabilities, but because attack techniques change frequently and may remain undetected for extended periods, these efforts may not succeed. Our business is also subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and other matters relating to information collection—for example, the GDPR in the European Economic Area, the CCPA in California, and potential future state, federal, and foreign requirements—noncompliance with which could lead to penalties, fines, litigation, loss of customer confidence, reputational damage, and increased costs. Finally, our estimates of da Vinci procedure volumes and surgical market sizes may be affected over time by factors including system internet connectivity, underscoring our reliance on robust information systems capability to support accurate reporting and strategic decision-making.

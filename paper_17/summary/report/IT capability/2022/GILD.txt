We depend on relationships with third parties for sales and marketing performance, technology, development, logistics and commercialization of products, and we extensively outsource our clinical trial activities—performing only a small portion in-house—and rely on independent contract research organizations to manage document preparation, site identification, patient enrollment, ongoing monitoring, site management and bioanalytical analysis; we also rely on third-party sites, shippers, couriers and hospitals for the logistical collection of patients’ cells and the delivery of our CAR-T therapies. In addition, we operate a new automated CAR T-cell therapy manufacturing facility, representing the introduction of large-scale automation into our production processes, which may require additional time and resources to increase capacity effectively. We are dependent upon information technology systems, infrastructure and data, including our Kite Konnect platform, which is critical to maintain chain of identity and chain of custody of Yescarta and Tecartus. The multitude and complexity of our computer systems make them inherently vulnerable to service interruption or destruction, malicious intrusion and ransomware attack, and data privacy or cybersecurity incidents or breaches by employees or others can expose sensitive data—including our intellectual property, trade secrets and the personal information of employees, patients, customers and business partners—to unauthorized persons or the public. Cybersecurity attacks are increasing in frequency, sophistication and intensity, as malicious actors seek to steal money, gain unauthorized access, destroy or manipulate data and disrupt operations, often via novel or zero-day attacks before patches are available and by employing counter-forensic tactics that impair prevention, detection and response. Such attacks can involve harmful malware, ransomware, denial-of-service, social engineering and other means that threaten data confidentiality, integrity and availability, and our business and technology partners face similar risks. When incidents occur, our policy is to respond and address them in accordance with applicable governmental regulations and our cybersecurity protocols, yet no assurance exists that our investments in protecting our IT infrastructure and data will shield us from significant losses, liability or future breaches. Regulators globally are imposing new data privacy and security requirements—such as the GDPR, the California Consumer Privacy Act and the California Privacy Rights Act—under which non-compliance may lead to substantial fines, litigation and increased operational costs or even curtailment of services in certain jurisdictions. Our integrity initiative under the 340B program likewise requires covered entities to provide claims-level data for dispensed units, underscoring the importance of our ability to manage information with accuracy, timeliness, security, confidentiality, connectivity and responsive tailoring to changing compliance and business needs.

Exposure to cyber risk is increasing systematically due to greater digital dependence and increases possible losses due to a catastrophic cyber event. Cyber catastrophic scenarios are not bound by time or geographic limitations and cyber catastrophic perils do not have well-established definitions or fundamental physical properties; rather, cyber risks are engineered by human actors and continuously evolve to evade established loss mitigation controls. We are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state laws and non-U.S. regulations governing the protection of personal and confidential information of our clients and employees, including medical records, credit card data and financial information, which are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently, sometimes conflict, and could expose Chubb to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal prosecution. We are subject to the New York Department of Financial Services’ cybersecurity regulation, which mandates detailed cybersecurity standards for all institutions authorized to operate in New York, and to the NAIC Insurance Data Security Model Law enacted by various states, which requires licensed insurance entities to comply with detailed information security requirements. All our EU businesses are subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation, and we must also comply with comprehensive privacy laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, the California Privacy Rights Act, and Brazil’s LGPD. Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information and assets in our computer systems and networks and those of third-party service providers, and our business depends on effective information security and systems and on the integrity and timeliness of the data our information systems use to run our business, to price products and services, to establish reserves, to provide effective, efficient and secure customer service, to value investments and to report financial results accurately and timely. Like all global companies, our systems and those of our third-party service providers have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to viruses, malicious code, unauthorized access, cyber-attacks, cyber frauds or other computer-related penetrations. Although we have implemented administrative and technical controls and taken protective actions—including due diligence security reviews and negotiated agreements with third-party service providers—to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our IT and assets, such measures may be insufficient to prevent unauthorized access, malware, business compromise attacks, system failures, disruptions, employee errors or malfeasance, loss of data or other security events. As the breadth and complexity of our security infrastructure grow, the potential risk of a security event increases, which may jeopardize confidential information or cause interruptions, delays or malfunctions in our or our clients’ operations, or result in data or asset loss, reputational damage or adverse effects on critical business functions. Chubb may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify protective measures or remediate vulnerabilities, and when we rely on third parties to perform business functions or process data, we may be exposed to additional data security risk. Despite contingency plans, facilities and efforts to meet regulatory information security requirements, our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by disruptions to the infrastructure supporting our operations, including electrical, communications, transportation or other services. We use analytical models and data analytics to assist decision-making in underwriting, pricing, claims, reserving, reinsurance and catastrophe risk, but these models are subject to assumptions, uncertainties, model errors and the inherent limitations of statistical analysis and historical data, and actual results may differ materially from modeled outputs. Recent technological advancements in the insurance and IT industries—such as increased use of data analytics, evolving technology in underwriting, claims, distribution and operations, and accelerated transaction speeds—present new, fast-evolving competitive risks, and if we do not anticipate or keep pace with these technological changes and evolving data analytics, our competitive positioning and ability to compete in desired markets could be materially limited. Our risk factors also include the ability of our technology resources, including information systems and security, to perform as anticipated and to prevent material IT failures or third-party infiltrations or hacking that could adversely affect Chubb or its customers or partners, and we continually seek to increase the use of data analytics and adapt to new technologies as part of our business strategy.

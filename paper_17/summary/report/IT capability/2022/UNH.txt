The company discloses that its ability to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure IT resources in support of its business strategies and processes hinges on the integrity, availability, security and performance of its information systems, and that failure to maintain or protect data integrity or to consolidate, integrate, upgrade and expand existing systems and technology platforms could materially and adversely affect operations, financial position and cash flows. It warns that inaccurate, unreliable or untimely data could undermine medical cost estimation, pricing, fraud prevention, provider payments, regulatory reporting and customer and provider relationships, while connectivity among technologies is deemed increasingly important to support sophisticated mobile applications and greater consumer engagement. The firm commits significant resources to develop new systems, enhance existing capabilities and implement new and innovative services—automating administrative processes and clinical decision making and supporting timely, accurate reporting—but acknowledges that these efforts may not succeed, exposing it to higher costs, management distraction or operational disruption. Rapidly evolving U.S., non-U.S. and international health data and health IT regulations may require reconfiguration of information platforms, altering competitive positioning and compliance burdens. Moreover, the company and its third-party vendors routinely process, store and transmit large volumes of protected and proprietary data across global IT systems, exposing it to cyber-attacks, malware, ransomware, software or hardware defects, social engineering, remote-work vulnerabilities and other security threats. Although it has programs for threat detection, containment, incident response, employee training and business continuity and resiliency planning, unsuccessful remediation or breaches could result in service interruptions, customer attrition, liability, regulatory penalties, litigation, reputational harm and other serious negative consequences.

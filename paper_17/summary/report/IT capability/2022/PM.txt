The report explains that the company increasingly relies on third parties and their subcontractors or suppliers to support its finance, commercialization and information technology processes, noting that while such arrangements can improve efficiencies and reduce operating costs, they also diminish direct control and may disrupt product distribution, supply chain quality and availability, and the speed and flexibility of its response to changing market conditions and consumer preferences, potentially placing the company at a competitive disadvantage. It warns that the failure or disruption of its information technology networks and systems—or those managed by third-party service providers or business partners—due to cybersecurity attacks, unauthorized data tampering, security vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, human error or non-adherence to industry best practices could cause reputational damage, operational impact, data breaches, regulatory actions, financial loss and loss of revenue or assets, including intellectual property and sensitive data. The company and its partners heavily rely on information technology networks and systems, including internet-connected platforms, to manage business processes and operations such as data collection, storage, interpretation and processing; internal and external communications; marketing and e-commerce activities; product manufacture, sale and distribution; third-party relationship management; engagement with governmental authorities; innovation through research and development; and other essential activities, with some systems developed or managed by third-party providers that may expose the business to supply-chain style cyberattacks. It acknowledges that cyberattacks, security incidents and vulnerabilities continue to evolve in sophistication and volume, making it difficult to predict, detect and mitigate exploitations before material harm occurs. Accordingly, the company continues to invest in administrative, technical and physical safeguards aligned with industry standards and best practices and evaluates preventative measures on an ongoing basis, but recognizes that these safeguards may not fully mitigate the impact of service disruptions or system failures, and that delays in incident response could lead to business interruptions, financial impacts, litigation, fines, loss of revenue and assets, reputational harm and significant remediation costs. Finally, the company cautions that failure by itself or its partners to comply with complex and evolving privacy, data protection, artificial intelligence and information security laws—such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation and various U.S. state and federal statutes—could result in business disruptions, loss of reputation and consumer trust, litigation, regulatory actions including significant fines or penalties, financial impact, loss of revenue or assets and inconsistent or conflicting legal obligations across jurisdictions.

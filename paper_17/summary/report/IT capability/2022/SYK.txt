We rely extensively on information technology systems, networks and services—including internet sites, cloud and software-as-a-service solutions, data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware, software (including open-source software) and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed or hosted by third parties—to conduct our global business, coordinate supply chains, production, distribution, financial activities and customer support processes. Numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats pose risks to the security of our IT architecture, data confidentiality, availability, integrity and connectivity—risks that have been heightened by increased remote work and by geopolitical factors such as sanctions that could lead to an increased threat of cyberattacks—and we have made investments in network and systems monitoring, expert personnel, employee training, security policies and incident response protocols in accordance with applicable regulations to mitigate these threats. We further disclose that if our IT systems or those of our third-party providers fail or are breached, or if our business continuity plans do not effectively address such failures, we may face reputational, competitive and operational harm as well as litigation and regulatory action. We are in the process of implementing a new global enterprise resource planning system to replace many of our existing operating and financial systems, recognizing that any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in its design or implementation could adversely affect our ability to process orders, ship products, provide services and customer support, send invoices, track payments and otherwise operate essential business processes. Lastly, our acquisition of a digital care coordination and communication platform underscores the strategic integration of IT capabilities to diversify our technology portfolio, advance innovations and accelerate our digital aspirations, reflecting the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources to support business transformation and maintain competitive advantage.

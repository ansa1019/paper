In our Risk Factors we note that driving convenience, brand engagement and digital relationships through our mobile, loyalty, delivery and digital capabilities both domestically and internationally is a key growth initiative and that our marketing, promotional and advertising programs rely on the allocation of our advertising, promotional and marketing resources across different channels, including digital marketing, to reach customers effectively. We acknowledge that failure to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain privacy and data protection laws and regulations may impose substantial costs and impede the development and offering of new products and services, and that the unauthorized access, use, theft or destruction of customer or employee personal, financial or other data or of Starbucks proprietary or confidential information stored in our information systems or held by third parties could damage our reputation, expose us to liability and result in significant response costs. We describe that many of our information technology systems—whether cloud-based or hosted on proprietary servers and including those that support point-of-sale, web and mobile platforms, online and mobile payment systems, delivery services, rewards programs and administrative functions—contain sensitive information and are subject to attempts to compromise them from both internal and external sources, with such attacks often exploiting malicious code, vulnerabilities in software or infrastructure, social engineering techniques or inadequate account security practices. We note that similar breaches could violate privacy, cybersecurity and other laws, trigger notification requirements, litigation and government investigations, and that we may incur significant capital investments and expenditures to investigate security incidents, remediate cybersecurity problems, recover lost data, prevent future breaches and adapt systems and practices, including costs associated with security technologies, training, personnel and expert services. We explain that media or other reports of perceived security vulnerabilities in our systems, whether ours or our third-party partners’ systems, can materially harm our brand and business, and that the techniques and sophistication of cyber-attacks change frequently and with little warning, prompting us to continue making significant investments in technology, third-party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes designed to anticipate and prevent or minimize breaches, although no measures can guarantee success. We also state that we rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations for administrative functions, point-of-sale processing and payment in our stores and online, supply chain management, Starbucks Cards, online business, delivery services, mobile technology—including mobile payments and ordering apps, reloads and loyalty functionality—and extend that these interdependent systems are critical to growth initiatives such as increasing digital relationships to drive traffic and spend, and that social distancing measures have accelerated the transformation of our store portfolio through convenience-led formats that depend heavily on our mobile ordering capabilities. We further indicate that we rely on third-party providers and platforms for certain information technology systems and support, that the hardware, software and services we or our providers supply are not fully redundant within or across markets and that operational safeguards, incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans may not be fully effective in preventing or resolving failures caused by events such as power outages, catastrophic events, infrastructure vulnerabilities, software flaws or human error, any of which could interrupt operations and lead to significant unplanned expenses.

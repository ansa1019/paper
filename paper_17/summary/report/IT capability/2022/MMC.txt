The company discloses its reliance on complex information technology systems and networks to collect, transmit, process, store and secure sensitive electronic information and the need to continually develop and enhance these systems to support business processes, strategic initiatives and data analytics in a cost- and resource-efficient manner. It acknowledges that its own and its third-party providers’ information and safety control systems, including cloud services, mobile devices, open-source software, social media tools and Internet-connected devices, are potentially vulnerable to unauthorized access, damage or interruption from external and internal threats, and that access controls and technical safeguards such as data encryption, multi-factor authentication, source-code scanning, monitoring and logging may be insufficient or not deployed promptly. The company further identifies the risks of advanced persistent threats, AI-enabled cyber campaigns, social engineering attacks (including phishing and impersonation), ransomware, supply-chain compromises and the increased attack surface created by hybrid-work arrangements, along with challenges in patch management given the volume, age and complexity of systems, and notes that any failure to implement, maintain or upgrade adequate safeguards, or to detect and respond to incidents in a timely manner, could have a material adverse effect and may exceed available cyber insurance coverage. It highlights that the integration of acquired businesses’ IT environments can expose latent security weaknesses or historical compromises, and that reliance on hundreds of vendors and other third parties for technology, information security and cloud hosting may amplify operational, compliance and resilience risks. The company describes its strategic investments and partnerships in technology infrastructure, software development and digital platforms, noting that such investments require substantial capital expenditures, may not deliver expected benefits or may become obsolete, and are critical to maintaining competitive advantage amid digital disruption driven by AI, data analytics, robotics and blockchain innovations. It also underscores that business continuity and disaster recovery depend on the availability and resilience of its computer, telecommunications and related systems, and that compliance with evolving privacy, data security and data protection regulations, such as the EU’s GDPR, the California Privacy Rights Act and emerging cybersecurity laws, requires ongoing review of technology systems, data management practices and internal controls, which could impose significant costs, divert resources and affect operational flexibility, market responsiveness and overall firm performance.

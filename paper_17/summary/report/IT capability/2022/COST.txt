The Company’s annual report underscores that the availability and performance of its information technology systems are vital to its operations, as these systems process a very high volume of transactions, conduct payment transactions, track and value inventory and produce reports critical for making business decisions, and that failure or disruption of these systems could adversely impact its ability to procure products and services, produce goods, move products efficiently to warehouses and sell products to members. It discloses that it is undertaking large technology and IT transformation projects and is making substantial investments in maintaining and enhancing its digital resiliency to prevent disruptions from power outages, telecommunications failures, security breaches, viruses, employee errors and catastrophic events, warning that failure or delay in these efforts could be costly, impair day-to-day operations, erode its competitive position and adversely impact its financial condition and results of operations. The report further highlights reliance on IT systems and networks—some managed by third parties—for virtually all business activities, including evolving omnichannel retailing via websites and mobile applications, noting that inability to develop or improve relevant member-facing technology in a timely manner could impair its ability to compete and adversely affect results. It also describes investments and acquisitions intended to improve the speed, accuracy and efficiency of its supply chains and delivery channels, while cautioning that the effectiveness of these investments may be unpredictable and not deliver anticipated benefits or returns. Cybersecurity and information security are emphasized as critical capabilities, with the Company required to maintain the privacy and security of personal and business information under global regulations, to defend against increasingly sophisticated threats—such as phishing, ransomware and advanced persistent threats—and to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of its systems and data; it warns that material cybersecurity incidents could cause reputational damage, litigation, government enforcement actions, penalties, unauthorized release or corruption of data, diminution in the value of its IT investments, increased remediation costs and loss of member confidence. Additionally, the Company notes its dependence on third-party payment processors and the necessity of complying with evolving payment card industry data security standards governing the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of cardholder data, cautioning that breaches or noncompliance could result in liability for card reissuance costs, fines, higher transaction fees and loss of payment acceptance privileges.

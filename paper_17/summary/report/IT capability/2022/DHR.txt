The company discloses that it relies on information technology systems, some provided and managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information (including sensitive business and personal data) and to manage or support critical business processes such as order receipt and fulfillment, billing, payment collection, shipping, customer support and contractual obligations, and it recognizes market-driven demand for products incorporating digital capabilities. It further notes that some of its remote monitoring products and services incorporate software and information technology that house personal data and that certain products or software sold to customers connect to the company’s systems for maintenance and other purposes. These IT systems, products and services may be damaged, disrupted or shut down by cyber-attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, human error, power outages or other disruptions, and the company acknowledges that its system redundancy and disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. Security breaches of its own or of third-party systems could result in misappropriation, destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personal data, interruption of operations, production and shipment delays, theft of intellectual property, strained customer and partner relationships, product malfunctions, patient safety risks, legal claims, regulatory penalties under privacy and other laws and increased remediation costs, and unauthorized tampering with products may degrade functionality and trigger recalls. The company warns that its liability insurance may be insufficient to cover such claims, that the increase in remote work has heightened cybersecurity and data privacy risks and that any failure to maintain reliable IT systems or appropriate global privacy and security controls could result in significant adverse regulatory, legal, reputational and financial consequences. It emphasizes that an ongoing commitment of significant resources is required to maintain, enhance and upgrade its IT infrastructure and systems—given continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving legal and regulatory standards, shifting customer expectations, emerging cyber-attack techniques and the IT needs associated with its evolving product offerings—and cautions that there can be no assurance of successful implementation. It also highlights exposure to an increasingly complex data privacy landscape across multiple jurisdictions, including requirements for local data storage, restrictions on data transfer, evolving state and international privacy laws and prospective federal legislation, which impose substantial compliance costs and may necessitate modifications to products or business models that could increase competition or reduce revenue.

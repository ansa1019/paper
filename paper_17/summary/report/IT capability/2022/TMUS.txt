T-Mobile’s disclosures include extensive discussions of the firm’s evolving information technology capabilities and related risks, noting that the company “routinely provide[s] certain confidential information to third-party providers whose products and services are used in our business operations, including as part of our IT systems, such as cloud services,” and that it “does not have control of the cybersecurity systems, breach prevention, and response protocols of our third-party providers” and “may not be able to effectively identify, investigate, and remediate” incidents in a timely manner.  The report emphasizes that “our procedures and safeguards to prevent unauthorized access to confidential information and to defend against cyberattacks seeking to disrupt our operations must be continually evaluated and enhanced” and that these “preventative actions require the investment of significant resources and management time and attention.”  It further warns that “if we fail to protect confidential information or to prevent operational disruptions from future cyberattacks, there may be a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows, and operating results.”  In discussing technological change, T-Mobile acknowledges that “if we are unable to take advantage of technological developments on a timely basis, we may experience a decline in demand for our services or face challenges in implementing or evolving our business strategy,” and that “in order to grow and remain competitive, we will need to adapt to changes in available technology, continually invest in our network, increase network capacity, enhance our existing offerings, and introduce new offerings to meet our current and potential customers’ changing service demands.”  The 10-K identifies risks around “enhancing our network, including the ongoing deployment of our 5G network,” where “equipment changes and the migration of customers from older technologies” and “implementation issues, such as scheduling and supplier delays, unexpected or increased costs, technological constraints, regulatory permitting issues, customer dissatisfaction, and other issues that could cause delays in launching new technological capabilities” may “reduce the anticipated benefits of the upgrades.”  T-Mobile also discloses its reliance on both internal and third-party “systems and networks … to provide and support our service offerings,” warning that “system, network, or infrastructure failures resulting from … unauthorized access to our IT and business systems or to our network and critical infrastructure and those of our suppliers and other providers” could “prevent us from providing reliable service” and materially harm the company.  Finally, the company describes its ongoing “modernizing our billing system architecture” project, “converting Sprint’s legacy customers onto T-Mobile’s billing platforms” and thus “operat[ing] and maintain[ing] multiple billing systems until such conversion is completed,” with any “unanticipated difficulties, disruption, or significant delays in either of these efforts … caus[ing] adverse operational, financial, and reputational effects,” as well as the risk that “errors, cyber-attacks or other operational disruptions … could negatively impact us and over which we may have limited control,” potentially disrupting the ability “to provide or bill for our services, retain customers, attract new customers, or negatively impact overall customer experience.”

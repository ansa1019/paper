Lockheed Martin has undertaken a multi-year business transformation initiative to significantly enhance its digital infrastructure, making substantial IT investments to increase operational efficiency, collaboration and cost reduction across its global operations.  To advance innovation and meet evolving customer requirements, the company is implementing emerging digital and network technologies and capabilities—ranging from digital manufacturing and operating tools throughout product lifecycles to joint all-domain operations solutions—and is strategically investing in commercial entities with complementary technologies.  Underpinning these efforts is an extensive information technology and cybersecurity framework that includes a global security organization with a dedicated computer incident response team, enterprise-wide threat detection and mitigation plans, supply-chain cyber-assurance measures, compliance programs addressing data protection and evolving security regulations, and partnerships with government agencies and industry peers to share intelligence and defend against sophisticated cyber threats.  Lockheed Martin recognizes that mobilizing these IT capabilities—integration of digital technologies, secure information management, network infrastructure and collaborative platforms—is critical to sustaining competitive advantage, driving business innovation and supporting its complex government and defense contracts, and that failure to successfully implement and secure these capabilities could materially affect its operations, financial results and strategic positioning.

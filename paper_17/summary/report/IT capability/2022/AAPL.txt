The company’s disclosures emphasize its heavy reliance on information technology systems and infrastructure and the centrality of IT capability to its operations, noting that failures or disruptions of its or its vendors’ IT systems—from natural disasters, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, telecommunications outages or power disruptions—can prevent access to its online services, interfere with customer transactions and impede the manufacturing and shipping of products; that system redundancy, business continuity and disaster‐recovery measures may prove ineffective or inadequate; and that it devotes significant resources to network and data security—through encryption, authentication technologies, multifactor authentication, continuous monitoring for unusual activity and related controls—while acknowledging these measures can be vulnerable to hacking, employee error or evolving threats, and that losses or unauthorized access to confidential information could materially harm its business and reputation. The company further underscores its in-house competence in designing and developing the complete hardware and software solution stack—including operating systems, software applications, cloud, digital content, payment and other services—reflecting its ability to deploy, integrate and secure IT resources in support of product innovation, service delivery, strategic transactions and regulatory compliance; it distributes third-party applications through its App Store, retains commissions on digital sales and adapts its platform practices in response to competitive, market and legal developments; and it depends on the IT systems of its global supply chain and logistical partners, recognizing that disruptions in these systems could adversely affect component procurement, production ramp-ups and overall operational flexibility.

In its 2022 Form 10-K, the company discloses that breaches of its security systems or those of its customers, suppliers or business partners—and the risk of unauthorized persons gaining access to facilities or technology infrastructure and systems—could expose proprietary and confidential information, create system disruptions or shutdowns, underscoring the importance of controls over physical security, the management, storage, processing and transmission of large volumes of proprietary, customer and employee data, and the ability to tailor connectivity and access in response to changing business needs; it describes cyberattacks including ransomware, denial-of-service, supply–chain and social engineering attacks on its and its partners’ technology infrastructure, noting that encryption and security algorithms in cloud-based products may nonetheless be compromised despite sophisticated hardware and firmware; it also highlights the growing dependence of its system solutions on advanced firmware and the need to update controller and hardware design and firmware to meet evolving customer specifications; and it emphasizes the criticality of coordinating manufacturing assets and internal processes—striving to balance demand and supply for each technology node, selectively adjusting facility utilization to reduce inventory, and maintaining relationships with third-party manufacturers, service providers and logistics carriers—to support business strategies, optimize process performance and cost efficiencies, and ensure timely delivery of advanced memory and storage solutions in a highly competitive, dynamic market environment.

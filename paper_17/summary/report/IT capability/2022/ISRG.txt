Intuitive Surgical emphasizes that its information technology systems are integral to supporting business strategies and work processes by enabling product operation, customer interfacing, supply chain coordination, manufacturing processes, financial reporting, and consolidated financial statement preparation. The company acknowledges that its IT capability—defined by the competence to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure technology resources, data management, and connectivity—faces evolving risks from system interruptions, cyberattacks (including malware, ransomware, phishing, and nation-state threats), unauthorized access, employee error, and third-party defects, any of which could impair information reliability, timeliness, security, confidentiality, and user access, and thereby materially disrupt operations, financial activities, and firm performance. The transition to hybrid work models has heightened the need to mobilize and deploy secure IT-based resources, strengthen remote access controls, encryption, authentication, monitoring systems, and IT governance practices, and ensure continuity of supply through enhanced collaboration with strategic partners and contract manufacturers. In addition, global privacy and data protection regulations—such as the EU GDPR, UK GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA—require robust compliance frameworks for cross-border data transfers, breach notifications, and protection of patient, customer, and employee information, underscoring the importance of strategic resource allocation, capability enhancement, and organizational integration of digital infrastructure to maintain competitive advantage, operational flexibility, and market responsiveness in an increasingly digital and interconnected business environment.

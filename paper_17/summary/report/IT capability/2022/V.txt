The company’s global payments business relies on the continuous evolution and coordination of its information technology capabilities—embodied in its VisaNet transaction­processing network and advanced digital infrastructure—that acquire, deploy and reconfigure IT resources in support of internal processes, interfirm transactions and business strategies. Innovations in payment technology, including mobile and proximity payments, ecommerce platforms, tokenization, push payments, Visa B2B Connect flows, cloud-based encryption and novel authentication methods such as biometrics, FIDO2, 3D Secure 2.0 and dynamic CVV2, have expanded its technology portfolio and enhanced its operational flexibility and market responsiveness. At the same time, the company must navigate regulatory requirements that could compel changes to existing rules or force it to share proprietary technology and intellectual property with third parties, affecting its ability to govern and leverage strategic IT assets. Its information management capability, which underpins data accuracy, timeliness, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access, is subject to cybersecurity and processing risks—from hardware, software or network failures, ransomware, DDoS attacks, supply-chain disruptions and third-party vendor defects—that could compromise system availability, data integrity and business continuity. To mitigate these threats, the company maintains extensive security measures and business continuity programs, works with third-party partners for technology development and adheres to evolving licensing, localization and intellectual property regimes, yet acknowledges the difficulty of predicting technology adoption, regulatory changes and potential IP litigation. Continued investments in IT infrastructure, process automation, data analytics and digital transformation initiatives, coupled with strategic alliances and rigorous IT governance, are critical to sustaining competitive advantage, supporting innovation partnerships, optimizing resource integration and preserving organizational agility in a rapidly changing payments ecosystem.

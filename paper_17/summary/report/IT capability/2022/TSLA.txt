We continue to expand and integrate our information technology systems across all material functions of the enterprise — including product data management, procurement, inventory management, production planning and execution, sales, service and logistics, dealer management and financial, tax and regulatory compliance — through both internally developed platforms and third-party deployments in the U.S. and abroad.  These systems are essential to coordinating our internal processes and assets, mobilizing resources to support production ramps, supply-chain management and customer delivery, enabling over-the-air software updates and connectivity for our vehicles and energy storage products, and providing timely, reliable and secure data to users.  In support of these capabilities, we have implemented IT safeguards designed to protect intellectual property, maintain information confidentiality and ensure system integrity, yet we acknowledge that our networks and those of our service providers and customers remain potentially vulnerable to cyber-attacks, malware, ransomware, phishing, social engineering, unauthorized access, exploitation of defects or other security incidents, any of which could disrupt operations, impair inventory or parts management, interrupt our ability to sell, deliver or service products, compromise the accuracy or timeliness of data, harm our reputation or expose us to regulatory or legal liability.  We recognize that failures in network or product system functionality, including any unauthorized control or manipulation of vehicle or energy product systems, could erode customer trust or strain our internal controls over financial reporting, and may require significant remediation efforts or alternative operational solutions.  To mitigate these risks, we actively encourage reporting of vulnerabilities, deploy security patches and updates to our connected products, monitor our IT infrastructures and pursue continuous improvements in system resilience, change management and process automation, all with the objective of leveraging technology resources in combination with our engineering, manufacturing and human capabilities to maintain operational flexibility, competitive positioning and ongoing transformation of our business.

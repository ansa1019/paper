UPS relies on information technology (“IT”) networks and systems, including the internet, internally-developed applications and third-party technology platforms, to support critical business operations—from receiving package-level information and tracking and moving shipments through its operations to efficiently planning deliveries, executing billing processes and tracking and reporting financial and operational data—and its franchise locations and subsidiaries also rely on these IT systems to manage their business processes and activities. The company collects, stores and transmits significant amounts of proprietary and sensitive or confidential data, regularly moves data across national borders and is subject to evolving privacy, data protection and security regulations in the U.S. and abroad, including the E.U.’s GDPR and various data localization laws. UPS acknowledges that its IT systems (its own, those of franchisees, acquired businesses and third-party service providers) are susceptible to programming errors, hardware failures, power outages, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, ransomware or malware attacks, state-sponsored threats, insider misconduct, telecommunications failures, human errors and other catastrophic events, any of which could cause material service outages, block legitimate access, result in loss or misuse of information or interrupt its business. To address these vulnerabilities, the company has invested and expects to continue to invest in IT security initiatives, IT risk management and disaster recovery plans, including security processes, protocols and standards and contractual provisions requiring security measures from third parties, although it acknowledges that emerging techniques to disable or degrade service may outpace its defenses and that hybrid and remote working arrangements may heighten these risks, potentially leading to business disruptions, loss of customer confidence, regulatory scrutiny, litigation or other material liabilities. In its management’s discussion and analysis, UPS further emphasizes a shift to a “better and bolder” strategic framework that seeks to enhance customer engagement by combining its integrated global network with digital capabilities to drive new services, exemplified by the acquisition of Delivery Solutions, a digital platform that optimizes customer deliveries across multiple networks, the expansion of its digital access program and ongoing hosted software application fees and other technology investments in support of its digital transformation and operational efficiency.

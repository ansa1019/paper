The Company states that its business depends on its information technology (IT) systems, which collect and process customer, associate, supplier and other third-party information, and that it relies heavily on IT systems operated and maintained both internally and by third-party service providers to manage all key aspects of the business, including planning, purchasing, sales (point-of-sale and e-commerce), supply chain management, inventory management, human resources, financial management, communications, information security and legal and regulatory compliance. It emphasizes that ongoing operations and successful growth are dependent on accurately anticipating current and future IT needs, developing, implementing and maintaining appropriate systems and effective disaster recovery plans, and on the ongoing integrity, security and consistent operations of these systems, including related back-up systems. The Company further observes that as its size and scale have grown, managing complex operations—administration, systems (including IT systems), merchandising, sourcing, distribution, logistics and compliance—requires effective information sharing, development of new capabilities and appropriately staffing and training an increased number of associates or managing third-party providers. It also warns that its IT systems and those of its suppliers and service providers are subject to increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks—malware, ransomware, phishing, denial-of-service, system vulnerabilities and other forms of compromise—and that business landscape changes such as remote working and geopolitical events have heightened the risk of data security incidents, leading to the need for additional mitigation strategies and investments across its IT security workforce, technologies and processes. The Company notes that the global regulatory environment on information security and privacy is increasingly demanding and that data security compromises or IT system disruptions can result in regulatory enforcement actions, class actions, contract liability, reputational harm and loss of customer or supplier confidence. It maintains that policies, procedures and controls designed to reduce these risks require costly and ongoing investment in technologies, hiring, training and compliance, and acknowledges that material business disruption, liability and reputational damage may arise from actions intended to update, enhance, modify or replace its systems and infrastructure, including from not accurately capturing and maintaining data, efficiently testing and implementing changes, realizing expected benefits or managing disruptions and diversion of internal teams’ attention. In addition, in its sourcing operations, the Company identifies information technology challenges as a material risk affecting manufacturing, third-party distribution, warehousing, logistics and transportation in its global supply chain.

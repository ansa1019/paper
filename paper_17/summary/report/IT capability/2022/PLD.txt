Prologis acknowledges that its business and operations depend on the resilience and security of its internal and hosted information technology systems and that, despite system redundancy, security measures and a formal disaster-recovery plan, those systems remain vulnerable to disruptions from energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication failures and cyberattacks (including malware, ransomware and unauthorized access), any of which could materially interrupt operations and require significant unplanned expenditures to remediate. The company also recognizes that third-party security breaches at vendors, sub-processors or service providers may compromise its data and operations, potentially leading to financial losses, and that a rise in phishing and business-email-compromise attacks—despite training, detection systems and response procedures—could increase operational and financial risk. Although past security incidents have had only modest financial impact, their growing frequency may drive higher ongoing costs for personnel, consulting and protection technologies, and any successful breach could trigger privacy-law violations, unauthorized information disclosures, legal and financial liabilities, reputational harm and erosion of stakeholder confidence, with remediation costs that may exceed insurance coverage. Prologis further notes that technological shifts—such as the reconfiguration of supply chains, autonomous vehicles, robotics and 3D printing—represent evolving dynamics that could affect its competitive positioning, resource allocation and long-term value creation.

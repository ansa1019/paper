The annual report warns that “a breakdown or breach of our information technology systems could subject us to liability or interrupt the operation of our business,” noting that we “maintain and rely extensively on information technology systems and network infrastructures for the effective operation of our business” and that in the course of our operations “we collect, store, and transmit confidential information (including personal information and intellectual property), and it is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information.” It states that despite implemented “security measures” and a “business continuity plan to deal with a disruption to our information technology systems,” there can be no assurance these efforts will “prevent breakdowns or breaches” arising from software or hardware malfunctions, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, employee theft or misuse, power disruptions, natural disasters, floods or accidents, any of which “could cause breaches of data security and loss of critical data, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business and subject us to both private and governmental causes of action.” The report further cautions that “cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication, and intensity, and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect,” often involving “malware and key loggers, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, malicious websites, the use of social engineering, and other means to affect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our technology systems and data,” and that “our increased use of cloud technologies heightens these third party and other operational risks,” while “remote work increases the risk we may be vulnerable to cybersecurity-related events such as phishing attacks and other security threats.” Finally, it explains that if “our processes and systems are not compliant with regulatory requirements, we could be subject to restrictions on marketing our products or could be delayed in submitting regulatory filings,” underscoring that both internal and outsourced systems—including those used by contract manufacturers and clinical research organizations—are “subject to continual review and periodic inspection by the FDA and other regulatory bodies,” and that any non-compliance could “result in restrictions on such drugs or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of drugs from the market, the imposition of civil or criminal penalties or a refusal by the FDA and/or other regulatory bodies to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new drugs or supplements to approved applications, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.”

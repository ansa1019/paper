Abbott’s disclosures emphasize that the company depends on sophisticated information technology systems to support both its infrastructure and its products and that these systems, which also store and process protected personal data, are vulnerable to cyber attacks, malicious intrusions, data privacy breaches and other significant disruptions; to mitigate these risks, Abbott invests in its systems and technology and in the protection of its products and data, monitors its systems on an ongoing basis for current or potential threats or vulnerabilities and for changes in technology and the regulatory environment, and acknowledges that neither these measures nor those of its third-party IT providers can guarantee prevention of future attacks or disruptions, any of which could result in increased costs and expenses, manufacturing challenges, product availability or functionality issues, damage to customer relations and reputation, lost revenue and legal or regulatory penalties. Capital expenditures in 2020 through 2022 included investments in information technology alongside the upgrading and expansion of manufacturing and research and development facilities and equipment, reflecting the firm’s ongoing commitment to enhancing its IT capabilities to support operations, risk management and business continuity.

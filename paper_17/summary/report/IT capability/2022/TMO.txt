The company acknowledges that a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, its information technology systems or violation of data privacy laws could adversely affect its business; accordingly, it periodically implements new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain business operations and to provide data and information with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access. These systems process, transmit and store electronic information—including confidential business information and personally identifiable data—and support a variety of critical processes such as interacting with suppliers, selling products and services, fulfilling orders, billing and collecting payments, shipping products, tracking customer activity and fulfilling contractual obligations, and the company recognizes e-business capabilities alongside technological innovation, price, service and delivery as key competitive factors. As it adds functionality or upgrades these systems, the company may suffer interruptions in service, loss of data or reduced functionality that could disrupt its ability to provide quotes, take customer orders or deliver accurate pricing and cost data, which in turn could delay production and shipments, diminish market responsiveness and operational flexibility, harm its reputation and financial results, increase security and remediation costs, and expose it to legal, regulatory and compliance consequences, especially given the vulnerability of certain non-redundant systems and disaster recovery planning to natural disasters, telecommunication failures and cyber-attacks such as hacking, viruses, ransomware, phishing and denial-of-service attempts.

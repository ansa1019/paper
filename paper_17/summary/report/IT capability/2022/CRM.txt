Salesforce’s risk disclosures underscore the company’s reliance on its ability to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure IT resources—ranging from third-party data center hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers to internally built infrastructure, hardware and software vendors—to support and scale its enterprise cloud computing services and professional services. The reports emphasize the information management capability required to store and transmit customers’ proprietary and sensitive data with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access, as well as the ongoing need to tailor governance policies, enhanced processes and internal security controls, monitoring systems and incident response procedures to mitigate evolving cyber-attack techniques, software vulnerabilities (such as the Apache Log4j issue) and defects or disruptions in complex services comprising proprietary, open-source and third-party software. Frequent changes to and growth in complexity of internal IT systems through early adoption of new technologies, periodic software upgrades, integration of acquired technologies and expansion into new geographic markets have increased demands on infrastructure capacity planning, operational flexibility and personnel capability, straining the firm’s ability to scale operations, maintain performance and optimize processes. Salesforce also identifies the risks of interruptions or delays from external dependencies on internet infrastructure and third-party service providers, the potential unavailability or cost increases of key hardware, software, data and cloud platforms, and the challenges of coordinating and securing disparate IT environments post-acquisition. To maintain its competitive advantage and align with business strategies, the company continues to invest in data centers, human capital software, development and replacement of internal systems and processes, strategic acquisitions of complementary technologies and certifications against industry-specific and privacy regulations, while enhancing operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and real-time data replication arrangements to ensure organizational effectiveness, process optimization and resilience in a dynamic digital environment.

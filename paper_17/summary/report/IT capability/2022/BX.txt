Blackstone’s filings emphasize its extensive dependence on technology platforms and “analytical, financial, accounting, communications and other data processing systems,” the critical role of “technology platforms and corresponding infrastructure” supporting its operations and the outsourcing of many services to third-party technology and cloud-based providers. The company cautions that “remote working environments may be less secure and more susceptible to hacking attacks,” that failures or cyberattacks could result in “unauthorized access to our proprietary information, destruction of data, system disruptions (including cascading failures of interconnected cloud services), and diversion or theft of funds,” and that “costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured.” Blackstone also notes that “disaster recovery and business continuity programs may not be sufficient to mitigate harm” from infrastructure disasters or pandemics, that updating or adapting these “technology platforms” to support growth may prove increasingly costly, and that “developments in financial technology, such as distributed ledger technology (blockchain), have the potential to disrupt the financial industry and change the way financial institutions do business,” reinforcing the need to monitor “new technology to address investor demand for product and strategy innovation.”

Berkshire Hathaway’s filings underscore that the company “relies on technology in virtually all aspects of its business,” with critical information systems that have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access, phishing efforts, denial-of-service attacks and other cyber‐attacks; the firm warns that a significant disruption or failure of these systems could cause service interruptions, safety and security failures, regulatory compliance breaches, an inability to protect information and assets against unauthorized users, loss of assets or critical information, remedial costs and reputational damage. While the company has instituted business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analyses to mitigate technology‐related risks, it acknowledges that if it is unable to acquire, develop, implement, adopt or protect rights around new technology it “may suffer a competitive disadvantage,” which could in turn harm its results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Berkshire further notes that cyber‐attacks could impair its ability to operate facilities, information technology and business systems or compromise confidential customer and employee information, and that political, economic or market instability resulting from such attacks may produce business interruptions, lost revenues, higher costs or other adverse effects. In addition, the company highlights newly enacted data privacy regulations in various jurisdictions that address the security of personal information stored in its information systems, networks and facilities, warning that noncompliance could lead to significant penalties and reputational harm.

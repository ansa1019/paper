Lowe’s disclosures emphasize the critical importance of its information systems and digital infrastructure in enabling its omnichannel retail strategy, noting that customer-facing technology systems must function as designed across computers, tablets, mobile devices, websites and mobile apps to provide a consistent, personalized experience by collecting, using and sharing relevant customer data within evolving privacy, security and third-party policy constraints; the company invests in, maintains and continuously improves its systems supporting sales, inventory replenishment, merchandise ordering, project design, transportation, receipt processing and fulfillment, and is undertaking a multi-year technology transformation to modernize its merchandise selling, accounting and finance systems, while leveraging enhanced labor management tools, store inventory management systems and improved pricing capabilities to drive operational efficiencies. These investments, however, may introduce operational challenges—including implementation delays, data loss, security failures, reputational harm and increased costs—if systems are disrupted or fail to scale, and the company relies on third-party vendors for digital storage technology, content delivery, authentication, fraud prevention, order and service fulfillment, supply chain management and back-office functions, which exposes it to cybersecurity risks such as ransomware, distributed-denial-of-service and other malicious attacks, system failures, human errors and remote-work vulnerabilities that could disrupt operations, erode customer confidence, incur remediation costs or trigger regulatory penalties under changing data privacy, cybersecurity and payment card security laws. Moreover, the success of strategic initiatives to adapt to changing shopping habits and demographics—such as omnichannel sales and market-based delivery models—depends on delivering the technology capabilities required to execute large, complex programs demanding integrated planning, initiative prioritization, program sequencing and new competencies in management, associates and contractors, as well as on attracting and retaining skilled technology professionals, and the failure to do so could negatively affect customer experience, competitive positioning, financial performance and shareholder value.

The 10-K underscores the bank’s critical dependence on its information technology capabilities through extensive disclosures of its digital banking platforms serving over 44 million active users (including 35 million mobile users), its electronic trading and algorithmic platforms, and the incorporation of automation, artificial intelligence and robotics into its processes. It emphasizes reliance on secure, scalable computing and data management systems—both internal and at third parties—for the collection, processing, transmission, storage and retrieval of proprietary and personally identifiable information, supported by access management, network, cloud and backup systems. The bank continuously updates, integrates and retires legacy software and hardware to remain compliant with evolving laws, support self-service digital channels and enable remote working, while deploying business continuity plans, intercompany funding platforms and contingency measures to address system failures, vendor disruptions, cybersecurity breaches and industry infrastructure outages. It discloses heightened exposures arising from expanded remote access tools, increased data utilization, third-party financial data aggregators, consumer demand for digital services and the digital asset ecosystem, and notes ongoing investments in technology infrastructure, security tools, risk monitoring and governance by management and the board to mitigate these operational, compliance and reputational risks.

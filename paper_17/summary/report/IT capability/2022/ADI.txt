The company relies on information technology systems throughout its operations to keep financial records and customer data, process orders, manage inventory, coordinate shipments to customers, maintain confidential and proprietary information, assist in semiconductor engineering and other technical activities and operate other critical functions such as internet connectivity, network communications and email. These information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, employee malfeasance, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events, and since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic some employees have been working remotely, which may pose additional data security risks. The company also relies upon external cloud providers for certain infrastructure activities, and a prolonged disruption in the information technology systems that involve internal communications or interactions with customers or suppliers could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs. Further, the company may be subject to security breaches of its information technology systems and certain products caused by viruses, illegal break-ins or hacking, sabotage, other cyber attacks, or acts of vandalism, and geopolitical tensions or conflicts may heighten the risk of such cyber attacks. The company’s security measures or those of its third-party service providers may not detect or prevent security breaches, cyber attacks, defects, bugs or errors, and security breaches of its information technology systems or those of its partners could result in the misappropriation, loss or unauthorized disclosure of confidential and proprietary information, system disruptions or denial of service, potentially causing significant financial or reputational damage. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of responding to breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant. The company’s product offerings in the digital healthcare solutions space, which include the collection and processing of sensitive personal information, subject the company to heightened requirements under data privacy laws. As a U.S. government contractor or subcontractor, it is subject to federal contracting regulations, including the requirement to comply with the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification and to maintain secure facilities and obtain security clearances for personnel. The company is also subject to privacy, data protection and data security laws such as the European Union’s GDPR, China’s PIPL and California’s CCPA and CPRA, and the costs of compliance with these evolving and sometimes conflicting requirements may limit adoption of its products and services and require substantial compliance costs, while any failure or perceived failure to comply with privacy or security policies or legal obligations or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized release or transfer of personal data could lead to governmental enforcement actions, litigation or negative publicity.

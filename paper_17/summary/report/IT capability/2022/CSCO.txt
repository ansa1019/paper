Cisco describes a continuous expansion and integration of its information technology capabilities, uniting networking, security, collaboration, applications and cloud platforms to help customers manage more users, devices and “things” and to provide a highly secure, intelligent foundation for digital business.  The company emphasizes its ability to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure IT resources—from hardware, software and analytics to management skills and human capital—in concert with other organizational assets to drive innovation, business transformation and competitive advantage.  Its shift from standalone product sales to an architecture-led, subscription software model, its investment in R&D for network programmability and software-defined networking, and its partnerships with suppliers and contract manufacturers illustrate a focus on aligning IT architecture, information management capability and supply-chain processes with changing business needs.  Cisco also highlights its governance practices, cybersecurity risk management, compliance with evolving data protection laws and ongoing enhancements to its digital infrastructure as critical enablers for delivering timely, reliable, secure and tailored information in support of organizational goals, operational flexibility, market responsiveness and sustainable firm performance.

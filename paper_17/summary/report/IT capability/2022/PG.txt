The company’s risk disclosures emphasize that it “relies extensively on information and operational technology (IT/OT) systems, networks and services, including internet and intranet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and technologies, physical security systems and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, many of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties,” to support and coordinate virtually every aspect of its value chain—from “ordering and managing materials from suppliers” and “converting materials to finished products” through “shipping products to customers,” “marketing and selling products to consumers,” “collecting, transferring, storing and/or processing customer, consumer, employee, vendor, investor and other stakeholder information and personal data,” and “summarizing and reporting results of operations, including financial reporting,” to “managing our banking and other cash liquidity systems and platforms,” “hosting, processing and sharing, as appropriate, confidential and proprietary research, business plans and financial information,” “collaborating via an online and efficient means of global business communications,” “complying with regulatory, legal and tax requirements,” and “providing data security.” These IT capabilities are supported by corporate functions that include “information technology and legal services” and by Global Business Services that furnish “scaled services in technology, process and data tools to enable the SBUs, the EMs and CF to better serve consumers and customers.” The company also recognizes that “numerous and evolving information security threats, including advanced persistent cybersecurity threats, pose a risk to the security of our services, systems, networks and supply chain” and that “if our critical IT systems or back-up systems or those of our third-party vendors cease to function properly,” business continuity plans may be tested by operational outages, inadvertent disclosures or ransomware attacks, any of which “could affect our ability to order materials, make and ship orders and process payments in addition to other operational and information integrity and loss issues.” Lastly, the firm notes that it “periodically … upgrade[s] our IT/OT systems or adopt[s] new technologies” and that failure in such upgrades “could expose us to increased cybersecurity breaches and failures,” underscoring that the effective deployment, security and continuous evolution of IT capability are integral to its operational flexibility and competitive strength.

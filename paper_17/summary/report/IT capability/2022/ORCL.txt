Oracle discloses that it operates in rapidly changing economic and technological environments characterized by rapid technological advances, evolving standards in computer hardware and software development and communications infrastructure, changing delivery models and sophisticated customer needs that require continuous development, integration and enhancement of its products, services and support offerings. The company emphasizes the importance of refreshing and releasing new cloud products and services, deploying machine learning and artificial intelligence innovations, and anticipating changes in information technology trends as part of its Oracle Cloud strategy, under which it plans investment levels based on projected revenues and growth rates. To support rising cloud demand, Oracle has invested in expanding data center capacity and establishing new geographic sites under long-term operating leases, outfits these centers with depreciable equipment and improvements, and delivers its enterprise applications and infrastructure technologies worldwide through flexible, interoperable on-premise, cloud-based and hybrid deployment models that customers can tailor to their needs. It recognizes cloud services and license support revenues ratably over contract terms and cloud license and on-premise license revenues at the point of software delivery, while treating its coupled hardware and software offerings as single performance obligations recognized on delivery. Oracle also notes that it runs its own operations, including cloud and other services, on its products and networks, underscoring the interdependence of its infrastructure, IT security and reliability, and highlights the risks posed by coding or configuration errors, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, integration with third-party components and the need for high-quality technical support. Finally, the company underscores its ongoing commitment to research and development—an activity that is both costly and entails long investment cycles—to maintain competitive position and meet evolving market and customer requirements.

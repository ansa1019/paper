AbbVieâ€™s operations rely on sophisticated software applications and complex information technology systems to support core business functions, and a failure or significant disruption of these systems from malicious intrusion, security breaches, data privacy or confidentiality lapses, or system breakdowns could materially impair critical business operations, expose sensitive intellectual property, trade secrets or personal data, lead to revenue losses, legal and reputational harm, and substantial remediation costs. Although AbbVie has invested in the protection of its data and IT systems and continuously monitors them, it cannot assure that these efforts will prevent material breakdowns or breaches that could adversely affect its business, nor that its cyber insurance will fully cover resulting financial, legal or reputational losses. AbbVie also depends on third-party providers of information technology, accounting, human resources, payroll and other outsourced services, and any failure by those providers to meet contractual obligations could have a material adverse impact on its operations and results of operations.

Boeing relies extensively on information technology systems and networks to operate the company and meet its business objectives, including in its Global Services segment, which offers aftermarket parts distribution and logistics, maintenance, engineering and upgrades, training and professional services and data analytics and digital services to increase efficiency and extend aircraft service life. Unauthorized access to Boeing’s, its customers’ or its suppliers’ information and systems could result in loss of intellectual property, unauthorized access to sensitive, proprietary or customer data, disruption or degradation of business operations or compromise of products and services. To address these risks, Boeing maintains an extensive network of technical security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms, monitoring systems and management oversight, and has established a cybersecurity governance council to strengthen governance and coordination of cybersecurity activities. Boeing also manages information and information technology systems for certain customers and suppliers and recognizes that any failure to protect against unauthorized access, release or corruption of confidential, classified or personally identifiable information could damage its reputation or lead to financial or other losses. Business disruptions—from threats to physical security or information technology systems, extreme weather or other acts of nature and public health crises—could delay delivery of products and services or result in destruction, manipulation or improper use of Boeing’s or its suppliers’ data, information systems or networks, adversely impacting sales, expenses and the company’s reputation.

Third parties regularly attempt to gain unauthorized access to our IT systems, including covert introduction of malware, exploitation of vulnerabilities in hardware, software or other IT infrastructure and impersonation of authorized users, and cyber-attacks on our IT systems or on our suppliers’ information technology systems, including those related to their manufacturing foundries or assembly, test or other facilities, could disrupt our manufacturing operations and broader business. we believe that we have a robust cybersecurity program that is aligned to international cybersecurity frameworks and leverages industry best practices across people, processes and technologies in an attempt to mitigate cybersecurity threats; as part of this program, we seek to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in our IT systems and software (including third party software) that could be exploited by hackers or other malicious actors, but we cannot anticipate, detect, repel or implement fully effective preventative measures against all cybersecurity threats, particularly as techniques become increasingly sophisticated and constantly evolve. our contracts with certain customers require us to obtain cybersecurity certifications for our IT systems, and we provide access to certain of our technology, intellectual property and other proprietary or confidential information to our direct and indirect customers, licensees, consultants and joint venture partners, any of which may wrongfully use or disclose such information, including state actors, thereby exacerbating our risk profile. in addition, our manufacturing operations could also be disrupted by security breaches of our IT systems, and our hybrid work model—adopted after modifying workforce practices during the covid-19 pandemic to have the vast majority of our employees work from home—may impair our ability to maintain our collaborative and innovative culture, cause communication challenges between on-site and off-site employees and rely heavily on our IT capability to support remote productivity and secure connectivity.

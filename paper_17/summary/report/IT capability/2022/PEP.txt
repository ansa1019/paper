The company depends on information systems and technology, including public websites and cloud-based services, for communications within the enterprise, interfacing with customers and consumers, ordering and managing inventory, operating facilities, protecting confidential information and complying with regulatory, financial reporting, legal and tax requirements, and notes that system shutdowns, degraded performance, security incidents or other disruptions to these information systems have negatively affected its business. It acknowledges that pandemics, remote work and evolving cyber threats have increased demand on its IT infrastructure and heightened vulnerability to cyberattacks, and warns that failure to allocate and effectively manage resources for network security, disaster recovery, employee training and infrastructure maintenance or to timely identify and respond to cyber incidents could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, lost revenues, data loss, litigation, regulatory fines, reputational damage or loss of customers. The company also cautions that failure to adopt new technologies—including artificial intelligence and data analytics to develop commercial insights, improve operating efficiencies and strengthen digital marketing capabilities—or to make the right strategic investments in data analytics to understand consumer trends and engage through digital media and emerging e-commerce channels could erode its competitive advantage and impair its ability to anticipate and respond to shifts in consumer preferences and retail disruption. It further relies on third-party service providers, such as cloud data and software vendors for payroll processing, benefits administration and finance and accounting functions, and notes that any failure by these providers to meet obligations or to prevent malware introduced through the IT supply chain may lead to systems performance degradation, processing inefficiencies, security breaches, adverse effects on financial reporting or reputational harm. Finally, it describes a multi-year business transformation initiative to migrate key systems, including financial processing, to enterprise-wide solutions, which has experienced systems outages and operating inefficiencies, and cautions that inability to build and sustain the proper IT infrastructure or to realize the expected benefits from this initiative could adversely affect its business.

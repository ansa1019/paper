Mastercard’s 2022 Form 10-K discloses that the firm operates a multi-rail payments network that connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners and other organizations worldwide by enabling electronic payments instead of cash and checks and making those payment transactions safe, simple, smart and accessible, switching (authorizing, clearing and settling) transactions through its unique proprietary core global payments network and offering additional payment capabilities including batch and real-time account-based payments. The company provides integrated payment products and services and value-added cyber and intelligence solutions that draw on its principled use of secure consumer and merchant data, and it has expanded its information profile through collection of additional data from multiple sources and channels to develop integrated and personalized offerings that respond to changing business needs, all of which has amplified the impact of privacy, data and information-security regulations and required monitoring and enhancements of its data management, governance and quality practices. Its operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential, proprietary and other information and technology in its computer systems and networks and those of its third-party providers, and account holders and customers increasingly use personal smartphones, tablet PCs and other mobile devices to access its services. The firm’s investments in new networks, such as open banking solutions and digital identity capabilities, support and strengthen its payments and services solutions, while outsourcing and specialization in the payments industry have introduced third-party processing relationships, disintermediation risks and heightened information-security threats, including attempted cyber-attacks, ransomware, phishing and state-sponsored actors, any of which could cause unauthorized disclosure, system failures or network outages, damage its reputation, increase costs and disrupt its business. Rapid technological developments—including innovations in smart cards and devices, contactless and mobile payments, e-commerce, cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, machine learning and AI—could render existing technologies obsolete or inhibit the firm’s ability to keep pace with industry-wide solutions and standards such as EMV or tokenization, while intellectual property rights of third parties may restrict technology development. Regulatory and government requirements—such as data localization mandates; requirements to host and deliver products on-soil; the EEA’s PSD2 strong customer authentication, forced data-sharing and AI governance rules; and central bank and “specified service provider” designations for real-time account-based payments platforms—affect its ability to leverage data for innovation, manage operational resilience and maintain IT governance, security and compliance. Mastercard’s franchise model, which sets the standards and ground-rules for its network, underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources—technology, knowledge, relationships, management skills and business process understanding—in support of business strategies, operational efficiency and competitive advantage.

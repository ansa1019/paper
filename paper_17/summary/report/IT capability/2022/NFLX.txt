Our operations rely extensively on developing and deploying technology resources and infrastructure, including proprietary and third-party communications and computer hardware systems hosted in our facilities and via third-party “cloud” computing services. We have architected our software and computer systems to utilize data processing, storage capabilities and other services provided by Amazon Web Services, and we currently run the vast majority of our computing on AWS, which, along with our inability to easily switch to another cloud provider, creates an operational dependency whereby any disruption or interference could adversely impact our business. We utilize a combination of proprietary and third-party technology to operate our business, including the technology we have developed to recommend and merchandise content to our consumers as well as enable fast and efficient delivery of content to members’ consumer electronic devices. We also utilize our own and third-party content delivery networks to stream high volumes of television series, documentaries, feature films and games, having built and deployed our own content-delivery network (“Open Connect”), and our delivery expenses include equipment costs, personnel expenses and third-party cloud computing costs; however, if internet service providers do not interconnect with our CDN or charge us to access their networks, or if we experience operational difficulties therein, our ability to efficiently and effectively deliver streaming content may be adversely impacted. We rely upon a number of partners to make our service available on internet-connected devices such as TVs, digital video players, set-top boxes and mobile devices and have agreements with cable, satellite and telecommunications operators, some of which compete with us, and if partners or other providers do a better job of connecting consumers with content, for example through multi-service discovery interfaces, our service may be adversely impacted. In scaling our streaming service and introducing new features such as our ad-supported subscription plan, we are developing technology and utilizing third-party cloud computing, technology and other services, while simultaneously building expertise in disciplines including creative, marketing, legal, finance and licensing that require significant resources and management attention and pose integration and operational challenges. Our service and systems are subject to cybersecurity threats, including computer viruses, denial of service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions, and our reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve members are dependent on the reliable performance and security of our systems; although we have implemented systems and processes to detect and prevent unauthorized access, the techniques used to gain unauthorized access are constantly evolving, and any significant disruption or unauthorized access, including fraudulent use of payment methods or unauthorized intrusion into members’ information, could result in loss or degradation of service, unauthorized disclosure or theft of data and intellectual property, regulatory scrutiny, litigation, reputational harm and increased operating expenses. We rely on internal systems and those of third parties to process payments using credit, debit, gift and prepaid cards, direct debit, online wallets and direct carrier billing, which are subject to rules, regulations and industry standards including data storage and additional authentication requirements, and any disruption in payment processing or increases in fees could adversely impact member acquisition, retention and results of operations. In connection with content production and merchandising, we collect and utilize member personal information and other data and are subject to U.S. and international privacy laws, including the GDPR and CPRA, and any actual or perceived failure to comply with these laws, or any perceived privacy rights violation, could lead to investigations, claims and proceedings by governmental entities and private parties, penalties and reputational harm.

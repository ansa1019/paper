Our risk disclosures emphasize that our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems and that modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls; that we maintain sensitive data on our information technology (IT) assets—and on our partners’ and third-party providers’ IT assets—and that IT outages, data loss, data breaches and cyber-attacks could compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information, be costly to remediate or cause significant damage to our business, reputation and operations; that cyber threats—from individual hackers and insider threats to state-sponsored attacks, zero-day exploits, compromised open-source or commercial software vulnerabilities and social engineering—have become increasingly prevalent, more difficult to detect and may enter our network through compromised user access credentials; that we maintain confidential and personally identifiable information about our workers and consumers, anticipate ongoing and increasing costs to enhance and implement information security controls and partner with third-party providers for worker services and IT support, which may expose us to additional risks; that we may encounter difficulties in upgrading and operating our new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, potentially disrupting business continuity and internal controls; and that we outsource to third parties certain supply-chain logistics functions—including product distribution, transportation management and IT support services—and rely on third-party wafer foundries, package assembly partners and other IT infrastructures for manufacturing, assembly, testing and support, any of which may be vulnerable to damage or disruption from events beyond our control; further, as we embrace mobility, cloud-based data sharing and other practices to promote business efficiency, we acknowledge that failure of security controls to keep pace with such changes or to satisfy regulatory and compliance requirements—including heightened scrutiny from the White House, SEC and other regulators of companies’ cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks—could materially adversely affect our operations.

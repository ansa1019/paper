Our business continuity and growth depend on our ability to deploy and coordinate information technology resources to support and enhance our systems and processes, as reflected in the disclosure that “to manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner,” and that “our existing systems, processes, and controls may not prevent or detect all errors, omissions, or fraud,” while acknowledging that “we may also experience difficulties in managing improvements to our systems, processes, and controls or in connection with third-party software licensed to help us with such improvements.” We recognize that these investments in technology infrastructure and administrative controls are critical to our IT capability, broadly defined as our competence to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure IT resources in support of business strategies and work processes. Similarly, our cost of subscription and support revenue includes “data center and cloud hosting service costs,” and we acknowledge that “our operating results could be adversely affected by … our ability to manage cloud hosting service costs and scale the cloud-based subscription offerings,” underscoring the role of cloud infrastructure in our IT architecture. In response to a rapidly evolving environment such as the COVID-19 pandemic, we instituted a flexwork program whereby employees “may choose to work from home or in the office,” highlighting the importance of secure connectivity and remote access technologies. Furthermore, our product portfolio—which includes physical, virtual, and containerized firewall appliances together with software licenses—embodies our IT capability to deliver networking and security features and functionalities across on-premises and cloud environments. These initiatives illustrate our ongoing efforts to mobilize and leverage IT-based resources in combination with other organizational assets to support our business needs, enhance operational efficiency, and maintain competitive advantage.

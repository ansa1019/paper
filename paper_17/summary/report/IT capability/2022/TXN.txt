We note that our global operations expose us to possible disruptions in transportation, communications and information technology networks of the various countries in which we operate, and that breaches of customer information technology systems can disrupt customer operations or their ability to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity. Our operating results and reputation could be adversely affected by cybersecurity events, breaches, disruptions or other incidents relating to our information technology systems or the systems of our customers, suppliers and other third parties, which may be caused by computer viruses, ransomware, malware, system failures, restricted network access, unauthorized access, terrorism, nation‐state espionage, employee malfeasance or human error and could, among other things, compromise our information technology networks; result in corrupt or lost data or the unauthorized release of our, our customers’ or our suppliers’ confidential or proprietary information; cause a disruption to our manufacturing and other operations; result in the release of personal data; or cause us to incur costs associated with increased protection, remediation, regulatory inquiries or penalties, or claims for damages. Cybersecurity or other threats to our information technology systems or those of our customers, suppliers and other third parties are frequent, increasingly sophisticated and constantly evolving, thereby making them more difficult to detect, mitigate and defend against, and a breach or other incident in our suppliers’ information technology systems could likewise result in the release of confidential or proprietary information or prevent us from accessing needed technology. In our management’s discussion and analysis, we emphasize that technology is the foundation of our company and that we seek discipline in allocating capital to the best opportunities, including how we select R&D projects and develop new capabilities like ti.com, to support our business strategies, leverage our manufacturing and technology advantages and enhance our ability to provide reliable, timely, secure and connected technology solutions in response to changing market and business needs.

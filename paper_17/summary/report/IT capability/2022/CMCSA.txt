In our annual report, management highlights that the Company’s ability to acquire, develop, adopt and leverage new and existing technologies —including advanced fiber-based networks, evolving wireless internet technologies such as 4G, 5G wireless broadband and fixed wireless networks, and DOCSIS 4.0 to enable multigigabit symmetrical speeds —is critical for supporting broadband, wireless, streaming and other services, coordinating assets and processes and delivering competitive value. The report notes ongoing investment in digital transformation initiatives, such as the development and enhancement of streaming platforms including Peacock, Xumo and SkyShowtime, alongside capital expenditures on line extensions, scalable infrastructure and customer premise equipment to facilitate connectivity and operational efficiency. It acknowledges dependencies on third-party vendors for hardware, software and operational support and extensive use of third-party and open-source software, data hosting and cloud-based services to underpin network management, customer service operations and programming delivery, as well as the need to monitor vendor performance and financial condition to mitigate supply chain and service-continuity risks. The Company warns of material cybersecurity and system disruption risks, citing constant attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in security architecture and system design, the potential for cascading impacts across networks and information systems, and the heightened risk of compromising confidential, proprietary and personal data provided to third-party vendors, which underscores the importance of robust security architecture, data protection, governance and continual program updates. It recognizes that consumer behavior shifts toward direct-to-consumer streaming and OTT services have changed distribution methods and intensified competition, requiring enhanced digital infrastructure, customer experience, service bundling and accelerated technology initiatives, and that regulatory developments —including broadband deployment funding initiatives, telecommunications access regulations and spectrum allocations —may constrain technology deployment and platform operations. Finally, the report emphasizes the strategic importance of protecting intellectual property rights for digital technologies, complying with regulatory and contractual requirements, and continuously updating monitoring systems and security measures to ensure the reliability, timeliness, confidentiality and access to information in support of evolving business strategies and processes.

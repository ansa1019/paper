The Annual Report repeatedly underscores the criticality of information technology and network infrastructure as foundational to our business strategies and operational processes, cautioning that adverse economic and geopolitical conditions and reduced IT and network spending may materially affect our performance and capacity to innovate.  It describes our cloud networking platform—rooted in EOS software and merchant-silicon-based switching and routing products—as a key IT capability that must interoperate seamlessly with a broad array of operating systems, software, hardware and industry standards to deliver the accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, connectivity and configurability required by our customers’ evolving business needs.  Management acknowledges that enhancing existing products and developing new technology to address virtualization, cloud computing, network automation, visibility, analytics and security threats is a complex, resource-intensive process requiring continual investment in research and development, merchant-silicon partnerships and supply-chain coordination to mitigate component shortages, extended lead times and cost inflation.  The report also emphasizes the importance of high-quality support services, robust channel-partner relationships and strategic resource allocation in sustaining operational flexibility, competitive advantage and effective information management in a rapidly evolving, globally competitive networking market.

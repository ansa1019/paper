We disclose that periods of rapid growth or decline in demand present significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems, and procedures for training, assimilating, and managing our workforce; that outsource providers play and will continue to play a key role in many of our transactional and administrative functions, such as information technology; and that disruptions to our supply chain could result from information technology or infrastructure failures, including those of third‐party suppliers or service providers. Our business is dependent upon the use and protection of technology, data, intellectual property and other sensitive information, and we maintain and rely upon critical information systems for the creation, transmission, use and storage of much of this information, including telecommunications, the internet, our corporate intranet, various computer hardware and software applications (some integrated into our products or required to provide our services), network communications, email, and software‐as‐a‐service products hosted on third‐party networks and servers. These information systems and the information they contain are subject to loss, release, misappropriation, misuse, disruption, breach or failure from causes including employee or contractor errors, phishing and other third‐party attacks, viruses, malware, denial of service, destructive or inadequate code, power failures, physical damage, and sophisticated or dormant techniques that may remain undetected, any of which could result in material adverse effects such as loss of or inability to access confidential or sensitive information, disruption of our or our customers’ operations and manufacturing processes, errors in outputs, misappropriation of assets or intellectual property, reputational damage, and failure to meet regulatory obligations. Although we have implemented ISO 27001 compliant security procedures, virus protection software, intrusion prevention systems, identity and access controls, and emergency recovery processes and carefully select our third‐party providers to mitigate risks, these measures cannot be guaranteed fail‐safe; we have experienced cybersecurity incidents in the past and may incur material losses in the future, and we face ongoing challenges in hiring and retaining employees with substantial cybersecurity acumen, and our policies and procedures may not always enable us to identify or respond to risks and incidents in a timely or effective manner.

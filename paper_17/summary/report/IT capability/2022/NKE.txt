Nike identifies in its Risk Factors that it faces “difficulties in implementing, operating and maintaining Nike’s increasingly complex information technology systems and controls, including, without limitation, the systems related to demand and supply planning and inventory control,” and warns of “interruptions in data and information technology systems,” “consumer data security” concerns and “cybersecurity risks” arising from remote work arrangements, third-party dependencies and evolving digital threats. The company discloses significant investments in digital technologies and information systems underpinning its Nike Direct and digital commerce platforms, emphasizing the need to continually develop and upgrade its technology platforms to ensure they integrate effectively across regions, work with diverse external systems, scale to accommodate rising digital demand and deliver “high-quality digital experiences.” Nike explains that it “relies heavily on information technology systems across our supply chain, including product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales and distribution, as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes, retail operations and other business activities,” and that “any interruption,” “failure to properly maintain, protect, repair or upgrade systems,” or problems “transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems” could disrupt inventory management, order fulfillment, consumer engagement and reporting functions. Management states it is “continuing to invest in data and analytics, demand sensing, insight gathering, inventory management and other areas to create an end-to-end technology foundation,” while acknowledging that “like other companies in the retail industry, we…continue to experience cyber-attacks,” and that failures in IT architecture, performance or security could have material adverse effects. The company also notes its compliance obligations under global data privacy regimes such as the GDPR, various U.S. and foreign privacy laws and the potential for legal, reputational and financial consequences arising from breaches or non-compliance in its handling of consumer and enterprise information.

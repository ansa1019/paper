Our risk disclosures emphasize that our operations and competitive positioning critically depend on the firm’s ability to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure IT resources—ranging from secure computer systems, networks and cloud-based infrastructure to software, data management platforms and third-party service providers—to support business strategies, internal processes, interfirm transactions and customer delivery.  We rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential, sensitive and other data in our computer systems and those of third-party vendors and devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update our systems and processes designed to protect the security, confidentiality, integrity and availability of our technology assets and material information;  however, we face evolving cyber-security and technology risks—including breaches, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, vulnerabilities in widely deployed third-party software, sophisticated state-sponsored techniques, insider misuse of material non-public information and challenges posed by integrating new acquisitions’ information systems—that may cause material interruptions or malfunctions in our websites, applications, data processing or connectivity, damage our brand and reputation, result in litigation, regulatory actions or financial losses, and harm our ability to retain and gain customers.  Our digital transformation efforts, including transitioning to cloud-based infrastructure, implementing new processes and technologies, and integrating the systems, policies and procedures of S&P Global and IHS Markit, involve complex, time-consuming and costly change management initiatives that may expose deficiencies in design, implementation or maintenance, require substantial capital and ongoing operational investments, and risk disrupting normal operations if our or our outsourcing partners’ systems, data centers or communication links fail to operate effectively, become obsolete or are incompatible with future versions of our products.  We also recognize that our information management capability—our ability to provide timely, accurate, reliable, secure, confidential and connected data and to tailor access in response to changing business needs—underpins our agility, market responsiveness and competitive advantage, yet it requires continuous capital investment, robust governance, disciplined IT investment processes and effective collaboration across multiple divisions, functions and business lines.  To mitigate these risks and strengthen our IT capability, we devote meaningful time and financial resources to cybersecurity preparedness, privacy and data protection compliance, disaster recovery and business continuity planning, access controls, monitoring systems, internal controls and corporate-wide standards, and regularly assess and improve our infrastructure, software development practices, cloud architecture and third-party relationships, while acknowledging that no security or continuity measures can provide absolute assurance against evolving threats or system failures.

We rely extensively on information technology systems, networks and services—including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools, physical security systems and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted or provided by third parties—to assist in conducting our business, and we also depend on suppliers, vendors, outsourcing partners and alliance partners to manage certain marketing, human resource, finance, IT, data and other functional services. A significant breakdown, invasion, corruption, destruction or interruption of critical IT systems or infrastructure—whether by our workforce, others with authorized access or unauthorized persons—could materially disrupt our operations, compromise the confidentiality, security or reliability of information, lead to data leakage or theft of confidential information through industrial espionage, malware, ransomware or social engineering attacks, and cause reputational damage or business interruption. As the cyber-threat landscape evolves, these attacks are growing in frequency, sophistication and intensity and may remain undetected for a period of time. Although we have invested in industry-appropriate protections and monitoring practices, established governance processes, maintain cyber insurance and continuously monitor our systems and those of our third-party providers for current or potential threats, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent future breakdowns or breaches that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

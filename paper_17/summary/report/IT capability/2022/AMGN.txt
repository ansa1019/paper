In the Risk Factors section, the company discloses that a breakdown of its information technology systems, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of its information technology systems, network-connected control systems and data, interrupt business operations and damage its reputation. To achieve its business objectives, the company relies on sophisticated information technology systems—including software, mobile applications, cloud services and network-connected control systems, some managed or hosted by third parties—that are highly integrated into its R&D efforts, clinical and commercial manufacturing processes and product sales and distribution processes. In a hybrid work environment where most employees work remotely for portions of their jobs, reliance on internal and third-party information technology systems has increased substantially and is expected to continue to increase. The complexity and interconnected nature of these systems makes them potentially vulnerable to breakdowns or service interruptions, and upgrades or changes to systems or software may introduce new cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks. Internal or external events that compromise system or data confidentiality, integrity or availability may significantly interrupt operations, result in significant costs and/or harm the company’s reputation. Systems are subject to frequent perimeter network reconnaissance and scanning, phishing and other cyberattacks that are growing in frequency, sophistication and intensity and include malware such as ransomware or other denials of service deployed through the software supply chain, e-mail, malicious websites and social engineering. Although the company has experienced denial of service attacks that did not succeed, there can be no assurance that future protective efforts will be fully effective. High-profile attacks on governmental entities or other multinational companies could leave the company unable to use key business systems, access or protect critical data or otherwise disrupt its ability to develop, gain regulatory approval for, manufacture, sell or distribute products. The company’s systems contain and utilize a high volume of sensitive data—intellectual property, trade secrets, financial information, regulatory data, strategic plans, sales trends and forecasts, litigation materials and personal information—some of which is processed, stored, managed or transmitted by third-party service providers, increasing risk exposure. Vulnerabilities or cybersecurity breaches experienced by third-party service providers have represented a substantial share of the information security risks affecting the company, and lapses by employees, business partners, nation-state actors or others could expose sensitive data to unauthorized persons, competitors or the public. Cyberattackers are increasingly exploiting vulnerabilities in shared or open-source code, and the frequent lack of disclosure around such code limits the company’s ability to fully assess system risks. Domestic and global regulators, business partners, suppliers and service providers face similar risks, and a security breach of a wholesaler distributor’s systems could significantly impair the company’s ability to deliver products to healthcare providers and patients. The company continues to invest in monitoring, protection and resilience of critical and sensitive data and systems, but it acknowledges no assurance that these efforts will detect, prevent or fully recover from all breakdowns, service interruptions, attacks or breaches that could adversely affect operations and result in loss or exposure of proprietary or confidential data. While the company maintains cyber-liability insurance, it is not sufficient to cover all potential losses from service interruptions, system breaches or data loss, and the company is subject to evolving global privacy and data protection laws—including the EU’s GDPR and the CCPA—each of which carries substantial penalties for noncompliance and could materially affect the company’s business and results of operations.

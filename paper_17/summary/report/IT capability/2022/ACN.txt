Accenture’s 2022 Form 10-K risk disclosures underscore that the firm’s ability to acquire, deploy and reconfigure information technology resources—inclusive of digital-, cloud- and security-related offerings, advanced analytics, artificial intelligence, automation, blockchain, internet of things, quantum and edge computing, and intelligent connected products—and to coordinate its global delivery model and partnerships across mobile, social media and cloud-based services is foundational to its competitive advantage and business transformation strategy. The Company highlights its dependence on information technology networks and systems to securely process, transmit and store electronic information, support operational flexibility and provide clients with data and information characterized by accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access. Ongoing changes in technology functionalities and regulatory requirements for data privacy and cybersecurity compel continuous investment in IT architecture, process redesign, enhanced governance and management skills to maintain performance, operational efficiency and market responsiveness. Failure to anticipate or adapt to these technological developments, drive innovation through digital engineering and manufacturing solutions, introduce new pricing or commercial models, or to safeguard against cybersecurity threats and data security incidents could materially impair Accenture’s ability to serve evolving client needs, mobilize IT-based resources in concert with other strategic assets and deliver sustained performance outcomes.

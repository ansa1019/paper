The company’s disclosures recognize that the rapid digital evolution and expansion of e-commerce and digital channels have materially reshaped its operating and competitive landscape, requiring the coordinated deployment of information technology resources to support procurement and supply chain processes, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing, collections, employee processes, consumer marketing, mergers and acquisitions, research and development and real-time electronic communications with bottlers, customers, suppliers and other stakeholders.  In particular, Coca-Cola has identified digitalizing the entire system—including creation of personalized consumer experiences, development of powerful digital tools for retail customers, and the use of data, artificial intelligence, automation, robotics and digital devices—as a top strategic priority, while building e-commerce capabilities, mobile-app solutions and digital marketing to sustain brand loyalty, grow market share and protect legacy route-to-market strategies.  The company acknowledges significant risks stemming from reliance on networks, cloud data storage and third-party IT service providers, including cybersecurity incidents, service interruptions, malicious software, social engineering, denial-of-service attacks and other threats to information security, privacy violations, business continuity and data confidentiality.  It maintains risk-assessment and governance procedures for third-party relationships but concedes it lacks direct control over their operations and compliance systems, which increases its legal, reputational and operational exposure.  In addition, evolving data protection laws and regulations—particularly those governing cross-border data transfers, data localization and “reasonable” technical and organizational security measures—impose substantial operational requirements and potential penalties for noncompliance, driving ongoing investments in technology infrastructure, system resilience, privacy controls and cyber-insurance coverage to manage these emerging IT capability challenges.

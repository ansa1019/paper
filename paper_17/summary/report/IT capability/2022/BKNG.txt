The company discloses that it is an “innovative technology company dependent on sophisticated software applications and computing infrastructure” and that its business model relies on “effectively offer[ing] our services on mobile devices through mobile apps and mobile-optimized websites,” “cloud computing,” and the integration of “new and evolving technologies” such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, smart home devices, chatbots, and virtual reality in order to build its strategic “connected trip” offering. It acknowledges that rapid technological and market changes—driven by the adoption of smartphones, tablets, and other smart devices, shifts in online search and meta-search algorithms, developments in cloud services, and the evolution of internet, networking, and telecommunications technologies—pose “challenges” to its ability to compete, requiring continual “investments in marketing and other customer acquisition costs,” “increased financial and personnel investments,” and the migration to “cross-brand global systems and processes.” The company highlights its reliance on “information systems capability” for “transaction processing, order management, and financial and accounting systems,” noting that “highly automated” processes can complicate “testing, troubleshooting, and auditing” and that it must “decorate” these systems with robust “IT governance,” “monitoring systems,” and “internal controls” to manage “cybersecurity and data privacy risks.” It describes measures to uphold “information security” and “privacy” through compliance with GDPR, CCPA, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, PSD2, ePrivacy Directive, digital services taxes, and pending Digital Markets and Digital Services Acts, and by defending against “cyberattacks” and “system vulnerabilities” including “malware, phishing, account takeover,” and “denial-of-service” attacks. The report further notes its dependence on third-party distribution channels, global distribution systems, payment processors, and affiliate networks—each requiring secure “connectivity,” “data management,” and “compliance”—and emphasizes that its “IT capability,” defined as its competence to mobilize and deploy both “physical or intangible IT resources” and organizational skills in tandem with other resources, is fundamental to supporting “business needs,” enhancing “operational flexibility,” maintaining “competitive positioning,” and enabling “business transformation” and “innovation” across its value chain.

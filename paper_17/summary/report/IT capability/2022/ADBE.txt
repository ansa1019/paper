Adobe’s future success will depend on our continued ability to enhance and integrate our existing products and services, introduce new products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner, meet changing customer expectations and needs, extend our core technology into new applications, and anticipate emerging standards, business models, software delivery methods and other technological developments; the integration of our products and services with one another and other companies’ offerings creates an increasingly complex ecosystem that is also partly reliant on third parties; we rely on data centers managed both by Adobe and third parties to host and deliver our services, as well as access, collect, process, use, transmit and store data, and any interruptions or delays in these hosted services, or failures in data collection or transmission could expose us to liability and harm our business and reputation; we continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure in an effort to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of threats to our data, systems and networks; we devote significant resources to address security vulnerabilities through engineering more secure products, enhancing security and reliability features in our products and systems, code hardening, conducting rigorous penetration tests, deploying updates to address security vulnerabilities, regularly reviewing our service providers’ security controls and auditing our hosted services against independent security control frameworks such as ISO 27001, SOC 2 and PCI; if we fail to plan infrastructure capacity appropriately and expand it proportionally with the needs of our customer base, service outages or performance issues could occur, which would impact our customers and subject us to regulatory and customer notification requirements; in our digital media segment, Creative Cloud provides desktop tools, mobile apps and cloud-based services for designing, creating and publishing rich content and immersive 3D experiences, delivering value with deep, cross-product integration, frequent product updates and cloud-enabled services including storage and syncing of files across users’ devices, machine learning and artificial intelligence, access to marketplace, social and community-based features with Adobe Stock and Behance services, app creation capabilities, tools to assist with enterprise deployments and team collaboration; our document cloud offerings include a set of integrated mobile apps and cloud-based document services which enable users to create, review, approve, sign and track documents regardless of platform or application source type; our digital experience segment’s Adobe Experience Cloud is an integrated platform and set of applications and services that enable brands and businesses to create, manage, execute, measure, monetize and optimize customer experiences that span from analytics to commerce and rest on pillars including data insights and audiences, content and commerce, customer journeys and marketing workflow; research and development expenses consist primarily of contracted costs associated with software development, third-party hosting services and data center costs, related facilities costs and expenses associated with computer equipment and software used in development activities; we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future investments or acquisitions as we face difficulty in integrating the operations, technologies, products or services and personnel of the acquired business and potential security vulnerabilities may expose us to additional risks; and our preparation for acquisition integrations includes estimating the costs related to fulfilling deferred revenue obligations using a cost build-up approach and evaluating intangible assets such as technology, knowledge and management skills necessary to advance organizational goals.

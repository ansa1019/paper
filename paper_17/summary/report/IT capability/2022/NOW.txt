Throughout this annual report, the company underscores its IT capability through its Now Platform, which drives digital transformation by integrating siloed business processes, workflows and “systems of record” into a scalable cloud-based infrastructure, enabling automated work processes, collaboration, data analytics and low-code application development. It leverages geographically distributed data centers, public cloud services and interconnectivity to optimize performance and resilience, employs machine learning, AI, hyper-automation, system observability, database scalability, security, cryptography and Internet-of-Things integration to enhance functionality and efficiency, and prioritizes information management by providing customer data with the requisite accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and controlled access. The report details substantial investments in technology infrastructure, data governance frameworks and IT systems architecture planning, as well as in partner training, certifications and professional services to support implementation and integration; it warns that evolving data privacy, residency, sovereignty and AI regulations and hybrid on-premises/off-premises deployment models may restrict data processing, necessitate localized solutions and demand significant resource allocation. The company recognizes that competitive positioning depends on continuous innovation to address emerging “digital workflow” demands, accurately anticipate customer IT needs, deliver new platform and database offerings, integrate with third-party technologies, secure the platform against sophisticated cyber-attacks and supply chain vulnerabilities, and provide sufficient support and professional services to ensure successful deployments—any deficiencies in these capabilities could adversely affect adoption, operational flexibility, customer satisfaction and overall business performance.

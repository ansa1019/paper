The company discloses that it relies on information technology in all aspects of its business, including systems operated internally, under the control of third parties, and through the use of open-source software, and that it devotes significant resources to protect those technology systems and proprietary data against cybersecurity threats. It warns that insufficient capital deployment to acquire, develop, implement, maintain or upgrade critical systems—such as positive train control or its transportation control systems—could result in service interruptions or competitive disadvantage. The firm further describes ongoing refinements of proprietary software to evaluate train and route characteristics and proactive interventions by its operating practices command center, which employs predictive analytics intended to reduce variability, prevent derailments, and support employee adherence to best practices. In its 2023 outlook and capital plan, the company emphasizes continued targeted investments in technology and infrastructure to improve operational performance, network resilience, fuel efficiency and risk mitigation, noting both the complexity of its information technology supply chain and the need to mobilize and integrate IT resources with broader business processes in order to safeguard system reliability, enhance connectivity, and maintain competitive advantage.

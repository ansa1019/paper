NVIDIA identifies the modification or interruption of our business processes and information systems as a potential disruption to our operations, processes and internal controls, noting that the efficient operation and scalability of these processes and systems is critical to support our growth. We rely upon internal processes and information systems to support key business functions, including our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and in fiscal 2023 we continued the implementation of accounting and consolidation functionality related to a new enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system; any ERP system problems upon implementation, such as quality issues or programming errors, could impact our continued ability to successfully operate our business or to timely and accurately report our financial results, imposing substantial demands on management time. Our ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access—and to tailor these in response to changing business needs and directions—is subject to cybersecurity risks, including product, system security, and data protection breaches and cyber-attacks. We rely on products and services provided by third-party suppliers to operate certain critical business systems, including cloud-based infrastructure, encryption and authentication technology, employee email and other functions, which exposes us to supply-chain attacks or other business disruptions; we cannot guarantee these third parties and infrastructure in our supply chain or our partners’ supply chains have not been compromised or contain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our information technology systems, including our products and services or the third-party information technology systems that support our services. To defend against such threats, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features, while holding confidential and proprietary information from partners and customers that, if breached or improperly disseminated, could expose us to litigation, regulatory actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm. We process sensitive, confidential or personal data subject to privacy and security laws, rules and regulations—including GDPR, CCPA and CPRA—and any restrictions on cross-border data transfers or data localization requirements could increase the cost and complexity of doing business. Rapidly changing technology and customer requirements require us to timely identify industry changes, adapt our strategies, develop new or enhanced products and technologies, launch new offerings—including standalone software, cloud solutions and software-, infrastructure- or platform-as-a-service solutions—and expand the ecosystem for our products and technologies. We develop, acquire and maintain the internal and external infrastructure needed to scale our business—such as acquisitions integrations, customer support, e-commerce, IP licensing capabilities and cloud service capacity—exemplified by our NVIDIA AI Cloud services, which include cloud-based infrastructure and software for training AI models delivered directly and through a network of partners under multi-year agreements. We also rely on third-party software development tools for design, simulation and verification of new products or enhancements, although design requirements to meet consumer demands for greater functionality may exceed available tool capabilities. When integrating acquisition target systems into our own, we have experienced challenges including lengthy and costly systems integration, delays in purchasing and shipping products, difficulties with electronic data interchange and other processes with key suppliers and customers, and substantial training and change management needs. Finally, new global trade and export control restrictions impose licensing requirements on certain semiconductors, systems and integrated circuits and require us to transition operations out of specific jurisdictions, complicating our research and development, supply and distribution operations and overall technology deployment strategies.

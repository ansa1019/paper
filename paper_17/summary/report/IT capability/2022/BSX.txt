Digital technologies have and may continue to increase in their applicability and importance to various aspects of our business, operating and competitive environments, R&D pipeline and product portfolio, and we believe we will need to develop new and enhanced digital capabilities and competences in order to remain competitive. We rely on information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) systems, including technology from third party vendors, to manufacture and ship our products, as well as to process, transmit and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations, and the size and complexity of our IT systems makes them vulnerable to a cyber-attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards, the increasing need to protect patient and customer information and changing customer patterns. We have established controls and procedures to escalate enterprise-level issues, including cybersecurity matters, to appropriate management levels and to our Board of Directors and its committees, and we have procedures to ensure that management responsible for disclosure controls is informed in a timely manner of known cybersecurity risks and incidents that may materially impact our operations and that timely public disclosure is made as appropriate. Any failure by us to maintain or protect our IT or OT systems, products and data integrity—including from cyber-attacks, intrusions or other breaches—could result in outages or unauthorized access to patient data and personally identifiable information, theft of intellectual property or other misappropriation of assets, or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations, or, in the worst case, could result in harm to patients.

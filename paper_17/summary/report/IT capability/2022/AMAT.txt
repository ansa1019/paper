Applied’s risk disclosures recognize a heavy reliance on third-party providers of engineering, software development, manufacturing, information technology and other services and warn of the potential for service interruptions from data hosting or telecommunications providers. The company identifies information technology or infrastructure failures—whether internal or in its supply chain—as capable of disrupting product development and delivery, internal communications, customer and supplier interactions, and the processing and reporting of financial results. It further cautions that accelerated digital transformation may intensify demand and strain manufacturing capacity, that an extensive remote workforce poses heightened data, information and cybersecurity risks, and that continuous investment in network security, data encryption and other protective measures is required to detect, prevent and remediate increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks. Applied also highlights the critical importance of successfully implementing enterprise resource planning and related information systems improvements to enable accurate order tracking, inventory forecasting, supply chain management, human resource allocation, financial data aggregation and overall business management, and it notes that evolving privacy, cybersecurity and data protection laws—including cross-border transfer restrictions—and stricter contractual requirements may impose significant costs and expose the company to regulatory proceedings and reputational harm if not fully complied with.

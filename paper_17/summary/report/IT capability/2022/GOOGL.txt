Within Google Cloud, we devote significant resources to develop and deploy our enterprise-ready cloud services, including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace, and we incur costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services, invest in cybersecurity, and hire talent to support and scale our sales force. The availability of our products and services and fulfillment of our customer contracts depend on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems, which are vulnerable to damage, interference, or interruption from modifications or upgrades, natural disasters, climate-related events, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, software bugs, ransomware and denial-of-service attacks, phishing schemes, or other attempts to harm or access our systems. Some of our data centers are located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes or other natural disasters, and some systems are not fully redundant, meaning disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities; interruption to or failure of our data centers could result in lengthy service outages. Our products and services are highly technical and complex, involve the storage, handling, and transmission of proprietary and sensitive information, and have contained—and may continue to contain—errors, defects or other vulnerabilities that could cause interruptions in or failures of our systems, improper disclosure or use of data, litigation, regulatory penalties, or reputational harm. We have dedicated significant resources to privacy and security incident response capabilities, including worldwide incident response teams, and are investing heavily in safety, security, and content review efforts to combat misuse of our services and unauthorized access to user data. To compete successfully in a rapidly evolving market characterized by changing technologies, shifting user needs and frequent introductions of rival products and services, we must anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant and useful products and services in a timely manner, which requires continuous investments in research and development, hardware including smartphones, home devices and wearables, technical infrastructure—including servers, network equipment and data centers in support of AI—and strategic acquisitions and partnerships to enhance our technology, expand engineering expertise, and leverage cloud, AI and other digital technologies. Capital expenditures for technical infrastructure and property and equipment, as well as operating lease commitments for data centers and offices, reflect our ongoing efforts to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in support of our business strategies and work processes and to maintain the resilience, performance and security of our information management capabilities.

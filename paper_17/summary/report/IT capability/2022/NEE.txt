NextEra Energy and its subsidiary FPL operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continuous functioning of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a very large number of highly complex, geographically diverse transactions; despite implementation of security measures, these sensitive and complex systems remain vulnerable to failures or unauthorized access due to events such as operator error, severe weather, geopolitical or terrorist activities, or cyber incidents, and any such failure or breach could compromise confidential data, impede critical business functions (including generation, purchase, billing, collection and processing of transactions), increase costs, prevent accurate and timely tracking of revenues or regulatory reporting, necessitate costly or disruptive system integration or data conversion efforts, divert management and employee resources, damage reputation and customer confidence, expose the companies to fines or legal claims and, in the retail business, heighten identity-theft risks as vendors and service providers require access to sensitive customer information.

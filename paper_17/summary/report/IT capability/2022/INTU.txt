Our disclosures describe a range of organizational actions and resources that support and reflect our information technology capability, including our ongoing investments in “security technologies and security and business controls to limit access” and the significant resources we expend “to create security protections designed to shield…data against potential theft and security breaches,” which underscore our competence in information management and security. We host, collect, use and retain large amounts of sensitive customer and workforce data, and our efforts to provide appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access are evidenced by our ongoing enhancements to internal information technology systems and software platforms and our reliance on public cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services for data processing and storage. In response to remote and hybrid work models, we have modified employee work locations and must manage “increased execution risks” and ensure operational flexibility by refining our return-to-workplace strategy. We recognize that “business interruption or failure of our information technology and communication systems may impair the availability of our products and services” and have designed high-availability capabilities and disaster recovery plans, although we acknowledge that these may not account for all eventualities. We also describe challenges in coordinating our interfirm transactions and relationships, as malicious third parties seek to “fraudulently gain access to our systems,” exploit vulnerabilities in open source or third-party software components, or leverage stolen credentials across platforms, which requires us to continually enhance our entitlement, monitoring and platform security to preserve customer trust and business performance. Finally, our collaborative efforts with state and federal agencies to implement industry-wide security and anti-fraud measures, including sharing information regarding suspicious filings, reflect our strategic resource allocation for technology governance, process optimization, and dynamic capability enhancement in support of our competitive positioning and value-chain coordination.

Amazon discloses that it continues to make substantial investments in technology infrastructure—spanning servers, networking equipment, data centers, and software and hardware upgrades—to build, enhance, and add features to its online stores, web services, electronic devices, and digital offerings and to expand and optimize its fulfillment network, and that these “technology and content” costs are allocated to segments based on usage. It emphasizes that its primary cloud‐services business, AWS, offers on‐demand compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine‐learning services both to external customers and to internal operations, and that the majority of its capital expenditures are directed toward supporting this AWS business growth. Amazon acknowledges that fluctuations in customer demand—particularly when many users access its websites in a short period—can cause system interruptions or delays that prevent efficient order processing or fulfillment, and that its fulfillment and data center networks are becoming increasingly complex, creating risks of excess or insufficient capacity, service interruptions, increased costs, and impairment charges. The company also relies on third-party technology and systems for encryption and authentication, employee email, content delivery, back-office support, and other functions and has developed systems and processes designed to protect customer data and reduce the impact of security breaches, although it recognizes that such measures cannot provide absolute security or redundancy, and that its disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient. These disclosures underscore Amazon’s focus on acquiring, deploying, combining, and reconfiguring IT resources in support of its business strategies, process efficiencies, scalability, and overall competitive positioning.

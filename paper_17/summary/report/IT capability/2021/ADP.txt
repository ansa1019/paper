Our businesses rely heavily on payroll, financial, accounting and other data processing systems and we need to properly manage our systems, applications and solutions, and any upgrades, enhancements and expansions we undertake from time to time, to ensure they properly support our operations. We host our applications in a combination of internally operated data centers and third-party cloud-computing services and maintain programs and processes to prevent, detect and respond to data or cybersecurity incidents, investing significant resources to modify and enhance our information security controls and remediate vulnerabilities. The collection, storage, hosting, transfer, processing, disclosure, use, security, retention and destruction of personal information require compliance with federal, state and foreign privacy, data protection and cybersecurity laws, for which we have implemented binding corporate rules to process and transfer personal data across borders in compliance with applicable regulations. We believe that providing insights from data, including artificial intelligence and machine learning, will become increasingly important to the value of our solutions and services, and we continually upgrade, enhance and expand our technology, solutions and services in response to evolving client needs and preferences. This strategic investment in digital technologies is exemplified by our next-gen payroll solution with a highly scalable, policy-based framework for self-service and transparency, the mobile-first Roll payroll and tax filing product featuring an AI-driven chat interface, the diversity, equity and inclusion dashboard on our ADP DataCloud platform, and the new user experience and native Workforce Management solution on our RUN platform. Through cloud-based HCM technology solutions, the ADP DataCloud and ADP Marketplace, and ongoing technology enhancements, we mobilize IT-based resources in support of business strategies, process optimization and competitive positioning while ensuring organizational resilience and data governance.

AbbVie depends on sophisticated software applications and complex information technology systems to operate its global business, including enabling remote work protocols instituted during the COVID-19 pandemic, and any failure, disruption or breach of these systems could expose sensitive data, disrupt critical business operations such as manufacturing, supply chain and customer services, and have a material adverse effect on AbbVieâ€™s financial condition, results of operations and reputation. Although AbbVie has invested in the protection of its data and monitoring of its IT systems, including safeguards for information privacy, reliability, security and access, and to date has not experienced a materially adverse incident, there can be no assurance these efforts will prevent malicious intrusion, random attack, loss of data privacy, system degradation or breakdown, any of which could result in legal, financial and reputational harm and substantial remediation costs.

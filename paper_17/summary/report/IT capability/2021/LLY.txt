The company discloses that it relies to a large extent on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems, infrastructure, and hardware, some within its control and some operated by third parties, to accumulate, process, store, and transmit large amounts of confidential information and other data, including trade secrets, clinical trial information, strategic plans, marketing and customer data, and personally identifiable information. It identifies a broad range of vulnerabilities to these IT systems—system inadequacies, operating failures, service interruptions or failures, security breaches, malicious intrusions, or cyber-attacks from various sources such as harmful malware, exploitation of third-party software or systems vulnerabilities, denial-of-service attacks, and social engineering—that could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its systems and data. The company warns that any failure, inadequacy, breach of, or unauthorized access to its IT systems or those of its third-party service providers, or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, could significantly harm its reputation; impair its ability to secure and maintain intellectual property rights; cause manufacturing interruptions or failures of products and services that rely on IT systems or business processes; damage operations, customer relationships, or clinical trial reliability; and expose it to substantial costs, including fines, litigation, or sanctions under evolving data protection laws, potentially eroding competitive advantage. It further notes that IT system security in certain jurisdictions may be weaker, heightening costs, uncertainties, and risks, and that it depends on third-party providers of data hosting, cloud services, suppliers, and distributors who face similar risks that could affect the company directly or indirectly. While the company maintains cyber liability insurance, it acknowledges that such coverage may be insufficient and that it continues to implement measures to protect, detect, respond to, and minimize or prevent these risks and to enhance the resiliency of its IT systems. Additionally, the company recognizes that equipment, mechanical, data, or IT system vulnerabilities—including inadequate controls or procedures, operating failures, security breaches, or cyber-attacks—could lead to manufacturing and supply chain disruptions, product shortages, and increased costs.

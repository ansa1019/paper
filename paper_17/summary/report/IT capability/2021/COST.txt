The availability and performance of our information technology (IT) systems are described as vital to our business; failure to successfully execute IT projects and to have IT systems available would adversely impact operations as these systems process high volumes of transactions, conduct payment processing, track and value inventory and produce reports critical for business decision-making and the efficient movement of products. We note the undertaking of large technology and IT transformation projects, the failure of which could impair day-to-day business operations and competitive position, and the importance of mobilizing substantial investments to build strong digital resiliency against power outages, system failures, security breaches and catastrophic events, alongside investments to maintain and enhance our digital resiliency. A debilitating failure of critical IT systems, data centers or backup systems would require significant resource investments to restore IT services and could seriously impair business operations, increase costs and disrupt service to members. We recognize that failure to deliver IT transformation efforts efficiently and effectively could result in loss of competitive position and adverse financial impacts. We are required to maintain the privacy and security of personal and business information in compliance with global data protection regulations, and increased security threats pose significant risks to our systems, networks, products and services. Our business activities rely upon internally and externally managed IT systems and networks, which collect, store and process sensitive information, and operating these systems securely is critical to our operations and strategy. Increased remote work has expanded attack surfaces and the sophistication of unauthorized access attempts, including phishing and ransomware, while our cybersecurity and compliance efforts, training, and third-party controls may not provide full protection. The potential impacts of a material cybersecurity attack include reputational damage, litigation, enforcement actions, system disruption, unauthorized release or corruption of data, diminution in the value of our IT investment and increased protection and remediation costs, adversely affecting our competitiveness, results of operations, financial condition and member confidence. We rely on IT-enabled payment transaction processing services provided by third parties under evolving rules, including data security standards for cardholder data, and any breach or compromise of internal systems could result in fines, increased fees, loss of payment acceptance and disrupted operations. In omnichannel retailing we acknowledge that failure to develop or improve member-facing technologies, including websites and mobile applications, could adversely affect our competitive agility and results of operations. In Managementâ€™s Discussion and Analysis we note significant capital requirements for information systems, investments to modernize our information systems, and a write-off of certain IT assets no longer expected to be utilized as part of that modernization, as well as continued investments and acquisitions intended to improve the speed, accuracy and efficiency of our supply chain, delivery channels and internal processes.

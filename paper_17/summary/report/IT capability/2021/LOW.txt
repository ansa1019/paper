We identify that the success of our strategic initiatives focused on omnichannel sales and marketing presence requires us to deliver the capabilities required to execute them, noting that our customer-facing technology systems must appeal to our customers, function as designed and provide a consistent customer experience. We also need to collect, use and share relevant customer data to effectively meet customer expectations of a more personalized experience, a process subject to external factors including data privacy and security legislation and third-party policies restricting data collection, use and sharing. To support our strategic initiatives and the related technology investments needed to implement them, we must attract and retain a large number of skilled professionals, including technology professionals. We acknowledge that our financial performance could be adversely affected if our information systems or those of third-party vendors are seriously disrupted or if we fail to properly maintain, improve, upgrade and expand those systems, and we invest in, maintain and make ongoing improvements to our existing information systems that support operations such as sales, inventory replenishment, merchandise ordering, project design and execution, transportation, receipt processing and fulfillment. We engage third-party vendors for digital storage technology and content delivery, recognizing that our systems and theirs are subject to damage or interruption from catastrophic events, viruses, malicious attacks, telecommunications failures or other vulnerabilities, which may result in significant expense, data loss and erosion of customer confidence. We caution that performance issues with customer-facing technology systems—including temporary outages caused by distributed denial of service attacks, ransomware or the absence of an effective disaster recovery plan—could destroy the positive benefits provided to our home improvement business and negatively affect our customers’ perceptions of Lowe’s as a reliable online vendor and source of information. We also recognize that our business and reputation could be adversely affected by cybersecurity incidents or the failure to protect customer, employee, vendor or company information or to comply with evolving regulations relating to our obligation to protect our systems, assets and such information. Access to the Internet from computers, tablets, smartphones and other mobile communication devices has empowered our customers and changed how they shop and how we interact with them, making our websites, including lowes.com, both a sales channel and a method of making product, project and other relevant information available, directly impacting our in-store sales. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services subject to payment card industry data security standards and other operating rules, and if we fail to comply with these requirements or if our data security systems are breached, we may be liable for costs or fines or lose our ability to process electronic payments, adversely affecting our business. In our management’s discussion and analysis, we describe ongoing investments in technology projects, including our new store inventory management system that provides associates real-time visibility to store inventory and reduces non-productive hours, the expansion of a simplified user interface across the sales floor to accelerate associate training and reduce customer wait times, upgrades to visualization and configuration tools offered online, and the conversion of select geographic areas to a market-based delivery model, enabling real-time appliance delivery tracking and expansion of same-day and next-day fulfillment options. We also note that the strategic integration of personnel, labor models, financial, IT and other systems in our strategic transactions is critical to realizing expected benefits, and that failure to integrate these systems can disrupt our ongoing business and adversely affect our performance.

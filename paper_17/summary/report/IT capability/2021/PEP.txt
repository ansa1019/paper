The increase in employees working remotely has resulted in increased demand on our information technology infrastructure, which can be subject to failure, disruption or unavailability, and increased vulnerability to cyberattacks and other cyber incidents. We depend on information systems and technology, including public websites and cloud-based services, for many activities important to our business—communications within our company, interfacing with customers and consumers, ordering and managing inventory, operating facilities, protecting confidential information, maintaining accurate financial records and complying with regulatory requirements—and if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build, sustain and secure our IT infrastructure or fail to timely identify or respond to cyberattacks, our business can be adversely affected. Similar risks exist with respect to third-party service providers, including software and cloud-based service providers, whose systems may be compromised to introduce malware through software updates or supplier accounts, and the need to coordinate with multiple providers may complicate incident resolution. Our multi-year business transformation initiative, which encompasses the phased rollout of enterprise-wide systems solutions, requires integrating and harmonizing information technology systems, and failure to continuously adopt new technologies—including artificial intelligence, data analytics and digital marketing capabilities—or to develop increasingly better digital tools and e-commerce capabilities for retail customers and bottlers, can impair our operating efficiency, competitive advantage and ability to coordinate and deploy resources across our value chain.

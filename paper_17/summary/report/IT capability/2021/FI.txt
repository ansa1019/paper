The Annual Report highlights the critical role of information technology capabilities in supporting and transforming our business, noting the need to “enhance our current products and services and to develop and introduce innovative products and services” in response to constant and rapid technological change and evolving industry standards, including tokenization and other security requirements, in order “to remain competitive”; describes our cloud-based point-of-sale and omnichannel commerce platforms (such as clover® and CaratSM), mobile payment services and digital banking solutions as integral components of our merchant acceptance, fintech and payments segments; emphasizes reliance on complex software and systems—ranging from account-and-transaction processing engines, e-commerce and real-time payments infrastructure to software development and technology hosting facilities—and the operational risks posed by disruptions at these facilities or in our supply chain for point-of-sale devices, computer chips and other technology components; details substantial ongoing investments in information security and controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of sensitive data under PCI-DSS, GDPR, u.k. GDPR, OFAC, AML and other regulatory frameworks, to detect and remediate vulnerabilities, and to maintain business continuity and disaster recovery plans; underscores our shift toward outsourced, scalable technology solutions for financial institutions and merchants in place of in-house applications, driven by a focus on digital channels (internet, mobile and tablet banking), data management, fraud protection and interoperability with card networks and ACH systems; discusses the accounting treatment of software licenses, hosted software and capitalized software development costs within our revenue recognition policies; and explains how we plan and assess integrations, intangible assets and goodwill—including forward-looking estimates of future cash flows, discount rates and cost synergies—to support strategic investment decisions, operational effectiveness and long-term firm performance in a dynamic competitive and regulatory environment.

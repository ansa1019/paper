Our rapid growth and global expansion have placed increasing demands on our information technology capability—the coordination and deployment of our IT resources, systems, processes and controls—to support business strategy, manage internal processes and interfirm transactions, and safeguard our networks and data. In particular, we have acknowledged that “if we do not effectively manage any future growth or are unable to improve our systems, processes, and controls, our operating results could be adversely affected,” and that “to manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner.” The shift to remote work in response to COVID-19 has further stressed our connectivity, security, cloud-based delivery and support services, lengthening sales cycles and testing our data centers and network resilience. Our investment in research and development of ML-powered next-generation firewalls, cloud-native security platforms, inventory management systems and supply-chain visibility tools, as well as the licensing and integration of third-party and open source software, reflects our commitment to continually enhance our capability to provide timely, reliable, secure, and scalable IT-based solutions. Any failures or inadequacies in forecasting demand, order-processing systems, security incident response, or ongoing product and subscription transitions could materially impair our operational flexibility, competitive positioning and firm performance.

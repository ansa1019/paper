In our risk disclosures and management’s discussion, we underscore how our IT capability—defined by our ability to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure IT resources in support of business strategies and work processes—is central to securing and scaling our enterprise cloud services. We describe our dependency on third-party data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers and the underlying public internet infrastructure, noting that any breaches, defects, disruptions or delays in these environments, as well as vulnerabilities stemming from enhancements, updates or newly acquired technologies, could impair service delivery, diminish customer confidence and damage our competitive positioning. We acknowledge that frequent changes to our internal IT systems, early adoption of new technologies, integration of disparate systems from acquisitions and the complexity of our ecosystem increase security, capacity-planning and continuity risks. To mitigate these risks and support operational flexibility, we invest in expanding data center capacity, upgrading and replacing software systems and processes, enhancing business and data governance policies, strengthening internal security controls, maintaining disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements, and providing high-quality technical support and professional services. Our MD&A further highlights ongoing reinvestment in research and development, strategic acquisitions of complementary services and intellectual property, and continuous innovation of our service offerings—all intended to mobilize and leverage IT and organizational resources, optimize process performance, enable data management and analytics, and sustain a dynamic, agile IT architecture aligned with evolving market needs and customer requirements.

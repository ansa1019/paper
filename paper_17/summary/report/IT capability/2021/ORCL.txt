Oracle operates in rapidly changing economic and technological environments that require developing new products and services, integrating acquisitions, and enhancing existing offerings in response to sophisticated and evolving information technology trends, delivery models and customer needs. Oracle provides products and services that address enterprise IT environments through flexible and interoperable deployment models including on-premise, cloud-based and hybrid environments, delivering cloud services and license support recognized ratably over contractual terms and cloud license and on-premise license revenues recognized upon software availability. To address customer demand for cloud computing, Oracle continually refreshes and releases new cloud products and services, invests in expanding data center capacity and establishing new geographic locations, and offers programs to pivot and migrate existing workloads to Oracle Cloud. Its hardware business delivers engineered systems with tightly combined hardware and software performance obligations and recognizes revenue at delivery, while hardware support services are recognized ratably as services are provided, and both hardware and cloud infrastructure depend on suppliers for essential technologies and components. The detection and correction of coding, manufacturing or configuration errors in cloud, license or hardware offerings can result in performance disruptions, security vulnerabilities and integration challenges with third-party products, thereby affecting service reliability and customer operations. Oracle also runs its own business operations, cloud and other services on its products and networks, regularly adopts new internal IT systems and policies, and has invested substantial resources in security measures to protect the integrity, confidentiality and reliability of customer and corporate data against cyber-attacks and evolving threats. In applying ASC 606, Oracleâ€™s IT systems capability is demonstrated by its identification of multiple distinct performance obligations, determination of standalone selling prices using observable market data or residual methods for licenses and support, and allocation of transaction price among cloud services, support and license revenue streams to ensure accurate financial and operational reporting aligned with its complex technology offerings.

We acknowledge that security breaches in data centers we manage, or third parties manage on our behalf, may compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of employee and customer data, that we process and store significant volumes of data across both Adobe-managed and third-party hosted environments, and that unauthorized access may occur through physical break-ins, network intrusions, software vulnerabilities, coding errors, employee misuse or inadequate security controls by customers or employees. We rely on data centers managed both by Adobe and third parties to host, deliver, access, collect, process, use, transmit and store data for our online store, Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud solutions, and we recognize that system interruptions due to capacity planning failures, hardware or software errors, security vulnerabilities, malware, insufficient redundancy or incomplete disaster recovery planning could impair product delivery, performance commitments and regulatory compliance. We devote significant resources to address security vulnerabilities through engineering more secure products; enhancing reliability features; code hardening; rigorous penetration testing; deploying updates; regularly auditing hosted services and service-provider controls against ISO 27001, SOC 2 and PCI frameworks; mandating security training for our workforce; and improving incident response times, while acknowledging that vulnerabilities cannot be entirely eliminated and may harm our reputation, customer relationships or brand. Our revenue recognition disclosures describe the inseparability of on-device software licenses and integrated cloud services—such as Creative Cloud Libraries, shared reviews, automatic cloud rendering and Sensei, Adobe’s cloud-hosted AI and machine learning framework—which together illustrate our evolving IT capabilities to coordinate internal processes, interfirm transactions and relationships, support collaboration, data synchronization and continuous feature enhancements. We further leverage a data-driven operating model and Adobe Experience Cloud solutions to optimize customer journeys, acquisition, engagement, retention and analytics across our digital media and digital experience offerings. Finally, we emphasize the critical importance of planning infrastructure capacity in line with customer demand, investing appropriately in technology systems to maintain data security and quality, and effectively managing third-party hosting and content delivery relationships, noting that disruptions—from global supply-chain issues to third-party provider terminations—may adversely affect our business agility and operations.

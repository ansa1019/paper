Berkshire Hathaway discloses that it “relies on technology in virtually all aspects” of its business and that certain of its “information systems have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access, phishing efforts, denial-of-service attacks and other cyber-attacks” with expectations of increasing sophistication and frequency, noting that “a significant disruption or failure of our technology systems could result in service interruptions, safety failures, security events, regulatory compliance failures, an inability to protect information and assets against unauthorized users and other operational difficulties.”  The company has “taken steps intended to mitigate these risks, including business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis,” yet warns that if it “is unable to acquire, develop, implement, adopt or protect rights around new technology, we may suffer a competitive disadvantage,” and that cyber-attacks “could further adversely affect our ability to operate facilities, information technology and business systems or compromise confidential customer and employee information.”  Berkshire also acknowledges that “competition and technology may erode our business franchises and result in lower earnings” and that “many factors, including technological changes, may erode or prevent the strengthening of competitive advantages.”  Moreover, with “data privacy regulations recently enacted in various jurisdictions in the U.S. and throughout the world,” the company highlights that these rules “address numerous aspects related to the security of personal information that is stored in our information systems, networks and facilities” and that “failure to comply with these regulations could result in reputational damage and significant penalties,” thereby underlining the importance of robust information management capabilities to provide data and information with appropriate accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access and to tailor these in response to changing business needs and directions.

We highlight our ability to build, maintain, and scale our technical infrastructure—including data centers, servers, network equipment, subsea and terrestrial cable systems, and office facilities—to support user growth, engagement, and the delivery of new products and services, noting that any changes, bugs, or technical issues in our software, hardware, algorithms (such as our news feed ranking), machine learning models, targeting and measurement tools, or third-party mobile operating systems, networks, and standards we do not control could impair our capacity to deliver products rapidly and reliably or meet the accuracy, timeliness, connectivity, security, and confidentiality requirements of our users and marketers. We rely on complex techniques and data signals to estimate our community metrics and to target and measure advertising effectiveness, and these models depend on data access that may be limited by encryption, regulatory constraints, or third‐party browser and OS policies, with any loss of such signals or technical limitations potentially undermining our process optimization, information management, content review, and overall IT governance. We face supply chain disruptions for key IT components, and global events—from climate-driven disasters to pandemics—have necessitated procurement changes, artificial intelligence deployment for safety and security review, and remote-work adaptations, each of which tests our operational flexibility, resource allocation, and control systems. In addition, we are investing heavily in software engineering headcount, research and development of augmented and virtual reality platforms, digital payments infrastructure, and emerging metaverse experiences, thereby requiring ongoing capital expenditures for technology infrastructure, agile process redesign, and reconfiguration of IT resources in alignment with dynamic market demands, evolving regulatory and compliance requirements, and our strategic objective to effectively leverage technology capabilities as a core element of our competitive advantage and business transformation.

Tesla continues to expand its information technology systems as its operations grow—implementing new internally developed platforms and deploying them globally for product data management, procurement, inventory management, production planning and execution, sales, service and logistics, dealer management, financial, tax and regulatory compliance and other administrative processes—and its vehicles and energy products incorporate complex IT architectures that provide built-in data connectivity for periodic remote updates. While Tesla maintains cybersecurity measures designed to protect against malware, ransomware, viruses, denial-of-service attacks, phishing, social engineering, hacking, exploitation of bugs or defects, breakdowns, power outages or other security incidents, it acknowledges that its systems—and those of its service providers, including workforce management software vendors—remain potentially vulnerable to supply chain attacks, unauthorized access or manipulation, system malfunctions and other disruptions that could impair data management, information accuracy and timeliness, inventory and parts procurement, manufacturing, sales, delivery and servicing operations, internal controls and financial reporting. Any such incident, or even the perception of product or network vulnerabilities, could disrupt business operations, incur significant remedial costs, expose Tesla to litigation or regulatory investigations, compromise proprietary or personal information, damage its reputation and erode customer confidence, and the implementation, maintenance, segregation and enhancement of these systems demand substantial management resources, support and investment. Furthermore, Tesla encourages reporting of potential security vulnerabilities through its formal vulnerability reporting policy and seeks to remediate verified issues promptly, yet acknowledges there can be no assurance that unrecognized or unremediated vulnerabilities will not be exploited.

During 2021, we continued to invest in information technology supporting both program-specific and general enterprise infrastructure, including capital expenditures for the development or purchase of internal-use software that are capitalized and amortized over two to six years; as of December 31, 2021, these capitalized software assets amounted to $777 million, net of accumulated amortization of $2.3 billion.  We recognize information systems support and software development as an integral part of contract execution and cost reporting under our percentage-of-completion accounting, and accordingly include related capitalized software in other noncurrent assets.  Current program challenges for highly complex efforts such as the F-35 aircraft include software development, future flight test execution and integration of mission and weapons systems evaluations, each of which underscores the need to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with other technical and organizational capabilities to meet evolving business and performance requirements and support robust data management, testing, and operational flexibility across the life cycle of our defense contracts.

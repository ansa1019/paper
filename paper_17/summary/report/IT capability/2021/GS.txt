Our risk disclosures emphasize that our IT capability—in terms of operational systems and infrastructure—is critical to our liquidity, business continuity and reputation. In particular, we acknowledge that a failure in our operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, as well as inherent technological defects and human error, could impair our ability to process and monitor a high volume of complex transactions, disrupt our businesses, and result in data loss or confidentiality breaches. We recognize that, as our client base and the volume, speed, frequency and complexity of electronic transactions expand, developing and maintaining our operational systems and infrastructure becomes more challenging, creating heightened cyber and information-security risks from sophisticated attacks, cloud-service disruptions and fundamental technology flaws. Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential information in our computer systems and networks and those of our vendors, and any inadequacies in our protective measures or in third-party service providers’ systems—for example, outages in critical cloud-computing platforms or vulnerabilities in distributed-ledger technologies—could be costly and undermine our platforms and clients’ access to them. We further note that enhancements to our protective measures themselves involve operational risks, including outages, and that our reliance on computing devices, phones, cloud-based solutions, application programming interfaces and remote-work arrangements increases exposure to security threats and potential disruptions. Finally, we highlight the importance of our resiliency plans and business-continuity strategies to mitigate such risks and maintain the integrity and performance of our systems amid evolving business requirements, regulatory changes and technological advancements.

The company’s disclosures underscore that its information technology capabilities are subject to evolving scope and risk, including the “ability to respond to and keep up with the rapid pace of technological and market changes” and the requirement that “failure to implement or adapt to new technologies in a timely manner or at all could adversely affect our ability to compete.” It warns of “risks related to cyberattacks; IT systems-related failures or security breaches, and data privacy risks and obligations” and acknowledges that “traditional IT business continuity and disaster recovery practices are less effective against certain types of attacks such as ransomware or malware,” which could “nullify our data” or “expose our payment card and personal data,” all despite maintaining “redundant systems and hosting services.” The company also highlights its dependence on “third-party computer systems and third-party service providers, including GDSS and computerized central reservation systems,” any interruption of which “could prevent us from booking related accommodation, rental car, and airline reservations.” Recognizing the impact of digital infrastructure on consumer engagement, it emphasizes that “it is increasingly important for us to effectively offer our services on mobile devices through mobile apps and mobile-optimized websites and to tailor our services to varying devices and platforms,” while noting that device companies may leverage control of “mobile operating systems or search services to favor their own travel service offerings.” In support of future strategy, the firm is conducting a “multi-year phased migration to integrate and upgrade certain cross-brand global financial systems and processes” and cautions that the “implementation of new information technology, payment, enterprise resource planning (ERP), or other systems could be disruptive and/or costly or we may experience difficulty successfully integrating new systems into existing systems.” Finally, the company recognizes that “recent regulations and policies impacting the way corporations use cookies and other tracking technologies” and evolving data privacy frameworks such as GDPR and the California Consumer Privacy Act impose “significant compliance obligations and costs.”

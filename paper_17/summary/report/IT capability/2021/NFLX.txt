We have built our own global content delivery network (“Open Connect”) to efficiently stream high volumes of content and utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems in our facilities as well as third-party “cloud” computing services, including Amazon Web Services, on which we run the vast majority of our computing, and have architected our software and systems to leverage AWS data processing, storage capabilities and services; given our inability to easily switch providers, any disruption of or interference with AWS would adversely impact our operations and our business. Any significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties—whether from cyber-attacks, natural disasters, telecommunications failures or rogue employees—could result in loss or degradation of service, unauthorized disclosure of member or corporate data, or theft of digital content assets, any of which could harm our reputation and impede our ability to attract, retain and serve members. If the technology we use to recommend and merchandise content or to deliver streaming to various consumer electronic devices fails, is unavailable or does not operate to expectations, including bugs or other software errors, our ability to efficiently and effectively deliver content and predict titles that members will enjoy may be impaired, adversely affecting member acquisition and retention and our competitive positioning. Moreover, if internet service providers do not interconnect with our CDN or charge us for network access, if partners fail to update or modify the consumer devices through which we offer our service, or if changes in network operators’ handling and pricing of data—such as usage-based pricing, bandwidth caps or discriminatory network management practices—occur, our operating expenses may increase, membership growth may be hindered and our overall firm performance could suffer.

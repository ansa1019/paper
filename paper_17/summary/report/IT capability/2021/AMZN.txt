The company discloses that it dedicates substantial resources to building and running its technology infrastructure, including servers, networking equipment, data centers, software and hardware upgrades, and related depreciation, in order to support both its internal operations and external AWS customers; that technology and content costs encompass payroll for research, development, design and maintenance of its online stores, web services, electronic devices and digital offerings; that competitors may devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment and marketing; and that expansion into new products, services and geographies can present new and difficult technology challenges with risks of service disruptions or failures. It acknowledges that failures to optimize and operate its fulfillment network and data centers can result in excess or insufficient capacity, service interruptions, increased costs and impairment charges; that occasional system interruptions and delays can render its websites and services unavailable or slow to respond; and that its systems are not fully redundant and its disaster recovery planning may be insufficient. The company also highlights reliance on third-party encryption, authentication, content delivery, back-office support and other technology vendors; the collection, processing, storage and transmission of large volumes of data that expose it to risks of data loss, theft, misuse or security breaches (including spyware, viruses, phishing, denial of service attacks and intrusions); and evolving regulatory requirements for privacy, data use, protection and network security. These disclosures underscore the firmâ€™s ongoing efforts to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure IT resources in support of business strategies, work processes, operational flexibility and competitive advantage, while managing compliance, cybersecurity and the challenges of digital transformation.

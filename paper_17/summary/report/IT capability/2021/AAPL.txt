The company notes that during the pandemic it “required substantially all of its employees to work remotely,” underscoring its ability to mobilize and deploy IT‐based resources to support business processes and workforce connectivity; it further acknowledges that its global supply chain and operations are exposed to “information technology system failures or network disruptions” from natural disasters, cyberattacks or other events, and that “system redundancy and other continuity measures” and business continuity and disaster recovery planning may be inadequate, potentially impeding access to online services, customer transactions or the manufacturing and shipping of products. In response, the company devotes significant resources to network and data security—employing encryption, authentication technologies, multifactor authentication and continuous monitoring to secure its systems and mitigate unauthorized access or data loss—even as it recognizes that such measures cannot guarantee absolute security. The company experiences “malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis” and notes that both it and its vendors remain at risk of ransomware and other cybersecurity incidents that could disrupt operations and expose confidential information. Finally, the company’s services business, including its app store distribution model and cloud offerings, depends on the availability of third-party software applications and digital content, highlighting the importance of coordinating IT architecture, digital infrastructure and external relationships to maintain competitive advantage and support its strategic objectives.

Prologis acknowledges that its internal and hosted information technology systems, despite system redundancy, security measures and a formal disaster recovery plan, remain vulnerable to energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication failures and cyber security attacks such as malware, ransomware or unauthorized access; any system failure or accident causing interruptions in operations could materially disrupt the business and generate significant remediation costs not fully covered by insurance. Third-party security events at vendors, sub-processors and service providers likewise could compromise Prologis’s data and operations via unauthorized access or service disruption, and despite ongoing training, detection systems and response procedures, an uptick in phishing and business email compromise poses growing operational and financial risks that may require investment in additional personnel, consultants and protection technologies. A successful security breach could lead to privacy and other legal violations, unauthorized information disclosure, legal and financial exposure, reputational damage and loss of confidence in Prologis’s security measures. Elsewhere, the company identifies “technological changes, such as reconfiguration of supply chains, autonomous vehicles, robotics, 3D printing or other technologies” as factors that could impact real estate values and customer requirements, and notes that it leverages proprietary data to monitor e-commerce-driven demand and occupancy trends, reflecting an underlying emphasis on information management, connectivity and adaptive operational capabilities.

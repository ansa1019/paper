Bristol Myers Squibb is dependent on information technology systems, networks and services, including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities, physical security systems, hardware, software and technical applications and platforms—some managed by third parties or their vendors—to conduct business; a significant breakdown, corruption, destruction or interruption of critical IT systems or infrastructure by authorized users or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations and give rise to unintentional dissemination, intentional destruction or modification of confidential information stored in our or third-party systems, portable media or storage devices. We rely on suppliers, vendors, outsourcing partners and alliance partners to manage marketing, human resources, finance, IT, data and other functions, posing risks that these parties may fail to perform to our standards, protect proprietary information, maintain business continuity or comply with legal requirements. The acceleration in the use of digital channels, including social media platforms, increases risks of brand damage, information leakage, and improper collection and dissemination of sensitive data. As cybersecurity threats evolve in sophistication and frequency—particularly ransomware and social engineering attacks amid the COVID-19 pandemic—and government entities face similar risks, we have invested in industry-appropriate protections, monitoring practices and cyber insurance, continuously monitoring for potential threats, though no assurance exists that these efforts or insurance fully mitigate financial, legal, business or reputational losses. The post-acquisition integration of Bristol Myers Squibb and Celgene operations includes consolidating cybersecurity systems, compliance programs and internal controls, and any inconsistencies in these IT and governance systems could impair our relationships with customers, suppliers, distributors, alliance partners, and clinical trial sites, and undermine our financial reporting and operational efficiency.

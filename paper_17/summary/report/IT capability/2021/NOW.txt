Servicenow was founded on a simple premise: a better technology platform will help work flow better, helping global enterprises across industries, universities and governments to digitize their workflows. The Now Platform enables us to connect systems, silos, departments and processes with digital workflows that are simple and easy to use and is uniquely positioned to enable our customers’ digital transformation from non-integrated enterprise technology solutions with manual and disconnected processes and activities to integrated solutions with automation and connected processes and activities. As a cloud-based service provider, we optimize performance of our products and services by utilizing data centers located in, and support provided from, different jurisdictions, which include colocation costs, interconnectivity between data centers, infrastructure hardware depreciation, public cloud service costs, software, IT services and dedicated customer support. Subscription revenues are primarily comprised of fees that give customers access to the ordered subscription service, related standard and enhanced support and updates, with revenues recognized ratably over the contract term upon commencement, while for self-hosted offerings software and support are accounted for as distinct performance obligations. We have made significant investments to obtain and maintain additional cloud security authorizations in heavily regulated markets and to support customers subject to evolving privacy and data sovereignty regulations, including FedRAMP High provisional authority to operate and DoD Impact Level 4 requirements. Our operations involve the storage, transmission and processing of our customers’ confidential, proprietary and sensitive data under a data governance framework designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss, and we devote significant financial and personnel resources to implement and maintain security measures despite evolving legacy code vulnerabilities, supply chain threats and state-sponsored attack campaigns. Delays in the release of, or actual or perceived defects in, our products may slow adoption of our latest technologies, reduce our ability to efficiently provide services, decrease customer satisfaction and adversely impact future product sales. As digital transformation accelerates across the enterprise, capabilities such as AI, machine learning, hyper automation, low-code/no-code application development, system observability, database scalability, consumer-grade user experiences, collaboration, internet-connected devices, security, cryptography, internal software development operations and application and service awareness become increasingly relevant to customers’ evolving needs. To compete effectively, we must identify and innovate in the right emerging technologies, accurately predict our customers’ changing digital transformation needs, invest in and continually optimize our own technology platform so that it continues to meet very high performance expectations, successfully deliver new, scalable platform and database technologies and products, efficiently integrate with other technologies within our customers’ digital environments, effectively secure our platform, data and customers’ data, and enable the digital transformation process planning, IT systems architecture planning and product implementation services required to support our customers.

Interruption to, interference with, or failure of our complex information technology and communications systems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services, as the availability of our products and services and fulfillment of our customer contracts depend on the continuing operation of these systems. We rely extensively on information systems and technology to manage our business and summarize operating results and are in the process of a multi-year implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system designed to accurately maintain our financial records, enhance the flow of financial information, improve data management, and provide timely information to our management team. Our systems are vulnerable to damage, interference, or interruption from modifications or upgrades, natural disasters, power loss, computer viruses and denial of service attacks, and some of our systems are not fully redundant, so disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. Our products and services are highly technical and complex and have contained errors or vulnerabilities that could result in interruptions or failures. We devote significant resources to develop and deploy our enterprise-ready cloud services, including building and maintaining infrastructure to support cloud computing services and hiring talent to scale our salesforce. We continue to invest heavily in hardware—our smartphones, home devices, wearables—and in land and buildings for data centers and offices, and in information technology assets, including servers and network equipment, to support the long-term growth of our business. To compete successfully in a rapidly evolving and intensely competitive environment, we must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant and useful products, services, and technologies in a timely manner, and we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development, data centers, and other operations to enhance our technology offerings and support business strategies and work processes.

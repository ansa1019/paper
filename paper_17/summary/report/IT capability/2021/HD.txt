We rely extensively on information technology systems and related personnel to collect, analyze, process, store, manage, transmit, and protect transactions and data, including systems managed or provided by third‐party service providers, such as cloud platform providers, and we depend heavily on the integrity, security, and consistent access to this operational and financial data for functions ranging from sales, customer and associate data, demand forecasting, merchandise ordering, inventory replenishment, supply chain management, payment processing, order fulfillment, customer service, and post‐purchase matters. For these information technology systems, applications, and processes to operate effectively, we or our service providers must maintain and update them, and delays in maintenance, updates, upgrading, or patching could impair, and on occasion have impaired, their effectiveness or expose us to security risks. A failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business. We are currently making, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in our information technology systems, infrastructure, and personnel, in certain cases with the assistance of strategic partners and third‐party service providers; these investments involve replacing existing legacy systems that are less flexible and efficient with successor systems, outsourcing certain technology and business processes, migrating applications to the cloud, maintaining or enhancing legacy systems, and designing or acquiring new systems with new functionality. These efforts can result in significant potential risks, including failure of the systems to operate as designed, potential loss or corruption of data, changes in security processes and internal controls, cost overruns, implementation delays or errors, disruption of operations, and the potential inability to meet business and reporting requirements. Disruptions in our customer‐facing technology systems could impair our interconnected retail strategy and give rise to negative customer experiences, and through our information technology systems, we are able to provide an improved overall shopping and interconnected experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from a variety of electronic devices and digital platforms. We use our digital platforms as sales channels for our products and services, as methods of providing inspiration and sources of product, project, and other relevant information to our customers, and we maintain multiple online communities, digital platforms, and knowledge centers to inform, assist, and interact with our customers. Customers are routinely and increasingly using technology and a variety of electronic devices and digital platforms to rapidly compare products and prices, read product reviews, determine real-time product availability, purchase products, and seek alternate delivery or pickup options, and we must continually anticipate and adapt to these changes by improving the online customer experience and our delivery options. Our ability to collect and use that data, however, is subject to external factors, including legislation or regulations governing data privacy and security. As more business activities have shifted online due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and as many of our store support associates continue to work in a remote or hybrid environment, we face increased risks from potential failures of internal or external IT infrastructure and from heightened cybersecurity threats and attempts to breach our security networks. We have implemented and regularly review and update systems, processes, and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of data, to prevent data loss, and to preserve data integrity, but the ever-evolving threats require that we and our third-party service providers continually evaluate and adapt our systems, processes, and overall security environment, as well as those of companies we acquire. The coordinated operation of our network of physical stores, distribution facilities, and online platforms is fundamental to the success of our interconnected strategy, and executing that strategy requires continual investment in our operations and information technology systems, as well as the development and execution of new processes, systems, and support to leverage our interconnected retail capabilities and enhance the customer shopping experience.

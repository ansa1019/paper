The annual report discloses that the company increasingly relies on third-party resources and their subcontractors to support its finance, commercialization and information technology processes, which, although improving efficiencies and reducing costs, may diminish direct control and require significant internal resource mobilization should those arrangements need to be replaced. It warns that failures of its information systems—or of systems operated by its business partners—to function as intended, or their penetration with the intent to corrupt them, together with any failure to adhere to strict data governance, cybersecurity protocols and privacy laws such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation, could disrupt business continuity planning and backups, compromise business processes, result in loss of revenue, assets, intellectual property or sensitive data, damage the company’s reputation and lead to litigation and regulatory action. The report further highlights that it is continuously evolving its approach to business continuity, data governance and cybersecurity in light of an increasing cyber threat landscape and growing reliance on digital platforms; that technological, regulatory or commercial setbacks could prevent the delivery of necessary infrastructure—such as age-verification technology and device activation features—for its reduced-risk product portfolio; and that the growing use of digital media could accelerate the dissemination of inaccurate or misleading information about its products. Finally, it acknowledges the challenge of attracting, motivating and retaining talent in areas new to the company—including digital and information technology—underscoring the strategic importance of IT capability in sustaining operational resilience and competitive advantage.

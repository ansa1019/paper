The company discloses that it and its Florida Power & Light subsidiary are highly dependent on sensitive and complex information technology systems and network infrastructure whose continuous functioning is required by the highly regulated nature of their industry, noting that despite implementation of security measures all of their technology systems are vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access from operator error, severe weather, terrorist activities or cyber incidents and that any failure or breach could compromise sensitive confidential or customer data, prevent fulfillment of critical business functions, damage reputation, diminish customer confidence and expose them to fines or legal claims. It further acknowledges that its business is highly dependent on its ability to process and monitor on a daily basis a very large number of complex transactions across diverse markets and that, due to the size, scope, complexity and geographical reach of its operations, the development, maintenance, modification and replacement of information systems is critical, challenging and costly—modifying existing information systems or implementing new or replacement systems involves integrating with legacy systems and processes, implementing associated changes in accounting procedures and controls and ensuring that data conversion is accurate and consistent—and that any disruptions, deficiencies or delays in these activities could increase costs, impair the ability to track or collect revenues, divert management and employee resources and hinder timely filing of required regulatory reports.

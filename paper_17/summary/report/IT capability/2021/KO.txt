The company highlights the critical importance of digital technologies and information systems in supporting and transforming its global business operations, noting that one of its top priorities is to “digitize the Coca-Cola system” by creating more relevant and personalized digital experiences for consumers, developing powerful digital tools and capabilities for retail customers, and digitizing operations through the use of data, artificial intelligence, automation, robotics and digital devices to increase efficiency and productivity. It warns that failure to build and maintain e-commerce capabilities, digital marketing and mobile-based shopping platforms, or to adapt rapidly to the digital evolution affecting consumer, customer, supplier and bottler interactions, could negatively affect sales, market share and financial results. The company relies on networks and information systems, including cloud data storage and other IT service providers, to support procurement, supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing, employee processes, consumer marketing, research and development and electronic communications, and it acknowledges that system shutdowns, service disruptions or cybersecurity incidents—stemming from hardware or network failures, software vulnerabilities, user errors, malicious software, social engineering, cyber extortion or denial-of-service attacks—could interrupt operations, delay financial reporting, compromise data security and confidentiality, and damage its reputation and profitability. To manage these risks, it maintains an information risk management program overseen by IT management and reviewed by a cross-functional committee, invests in personnel, technologies and training, and carries cybersecurity insurance, while recognizing that global data protection and privacy laws, cross-border data transfer restrictions and emerging data localization requirements impose evolving technical and organizational security obligations and potentially significant compliance costs. Moreover, the rapid growth of e-commerce and digital commerce channels and the shift of consumer shopping habits to mobile applications and online platforms are described as strategic imperatives requiring robust technology deployment, digital infrastructure, data analytics and continuous innovation to sustain competitive advantage, operational flexibility and value creation across its network of bottling partners, distributors, suppliers and third-party technology providers.

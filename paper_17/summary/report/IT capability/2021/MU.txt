To mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company enacted measures such as working from home, limiting onsite meeting attendees, quarantining at-risk team members, and restricting site access, which have materially affected production levels, R&D activities, product development, technology transitions, yield-enhancement efforts, and customer qualification activities. Disruptions to our global supply chain and delays in obtaining materials, equipment, labor, engineering services, government permits, and third-party services may impede our ability to introduce and deploy new technologies, optimize manufacturing processes, and meet customer demand. We maintain a system of controls over the physical and network security of our facilities and manage, store, and transmit substantial volumes of proprietary, confidential, and sensitive data relating to our operations, customers, and employees; unauthorized access or cyberattacks—through viruses, worms, or other malicious software—could compromise information accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, and confidentiality, create system disruptions or shutdowns, and damage our reputation. Our reliance on third-party service providers, including outsourced foundries, assembly and test providers, contract manufacturers, and logistics carriers, subjects us to risks that capacity and materials may not be available when needed or at reasonable cost, potentially limiting production output and disrupting customer manufacturing. We are subject to stringent compliance requirements under U.S. and international laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, export and import regulations, and customer responsible sourcing programs, as well as the performance obligations associated with government-granted incentives, all of which demand robust information management, IT governance, and security capabilities. Protecting our intellectual property, defending against antitrust and patent-infringement claims in multiple jurisdictions, and administering technology-deployment obligations under incentive arrangements further require our ability to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure IT resources in support of business strategies, internal processes, and interfirm transactions to maintain competitive advantage and operational resilience.

We have incurred and expect to incur substantial facility and systems consolidation costs in connection with the acquisition of Maxim, reflecting the challenges of integrating a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems across two previously independent public companies. The spread of COVID-19 has compelled us to modify business practices by restricting employee travel, altering work locations and canceling physical meetings, leading to a significant portion of our workforce temporarily working remotely and increasing our reliance on digital infrastructure. We depend on information technology systems throughout our company to keep financial records and customer data, process orders, manage inventory, coordinate shipments, maintain confidential and proprietary information, assist in semiconductor engineering and other technical activities, and operate critical functions such as internet connectivity, network communications and email, and we rely upon external cloud providers for certain infrastructure activities. A prolonged disruption in or breach of our information technology systems or those of our partners—whether from power outages, hardware or telecommunications failures, viruses, hacking, sabotage, employee errors or other security incidents—could result in lost sales, customer attrition, significant incremental costs and the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential and proprietary information. In our U.S. government contracting business, we are subject to stringent cybersecurity requirements, including the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification, and must maintain secure facilities and personnel clearances; failure to comply with these or with data privacy, export control and other regulatory mandates could adversely affect our ability to support business needs or compete for future contracts.

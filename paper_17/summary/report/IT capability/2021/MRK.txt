Merck’s disclosures emphasize the growing centrality of its information technology capabilities, noting that the company is increasingly dependent on sophisticated software applications, complex IT systems, computing infrastructure and cloud service providers to conduct critical operations—from manufacturing and research to sales and distribution—and to manage data acquisition, process automation and enterprise‐wide connectivity. The company acknowledges the material risks to its business posed by disruptions, degradations or manipulations of these systems—whether through network cyber‐attacks, unauthorized access, misuse of social media or mobile messaging channels, or failures by third‐party service providers—and cites the 2017 global cyber‐attack that disrupted its worldwide operations as evidence of the potential for exposure of confidential information, modification or loss of critical data, supply chain interruptions and adverse impacts on operational efficiency, financial performance and reputation. In response, Merck describes an ongoing, enterprise-wide effort to enhance and modernize its IT architecture and security defenses, improve resiliency and recovery speed, monitor system and data usage continuously, and strengthen policies around third-party outsourcing, “IT system” support and communications platforms—all aimed at safeguarding the coordination of its internal processes, interfirm transactions and strategic resource deployment in support of its business strategies.

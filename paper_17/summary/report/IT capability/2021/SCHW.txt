Certain of our client service response and processing times increased as a result of very high levels of client engagement and our clients experienced and may continue to occasionally experience delays accessing and using our website and mobile applications, a situation compounded by many of our employees and those of our outsourced service providers working remotely and, at times, the temporary loss of services from some of our outsourced service providers. We must process, record and monitor a large number of transactions and our operations are highly dependent on the integrity of our technology systems and our ability to make timely enhancements and additions to our systems. System interruptions, errors or downtime can result from a variety of causes, including changes in client use patterns, technological failure, changes to our systems, linkages with third-party systems and power failures, and can have a significant impact on our business and operations. Cloud technologies are critical to the operation of our systems and platforms, and our reliance on cloud technologies is growing, although cloud service disruptions may lead to delays in accessing data that is important to our businesses and may hinder our clients’ access to our platforms. We rely on external service providers to perform certain key technology, cloud infrastructure, processing, servicing and support functions, and any significant failures by them, including the improper use or disclosure of confidential client, employee, or company information, could cause us to incur losses and could harm our reputation. Security breaches of our systems, or those of our clients or third parties, may subject us to significant liability and damage our reputation, and despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, we may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches. Cloud service disruptions may lead to delays in accessing data that is important to our businesses and may hinder our clients’ access to our platforms. To support heightened client activity, to complete integration work relating to technology platforms and systems within the target timeframe and to enhance our technological infrastructure to support greater capacity for our expanding client base, we will continue to hire a significant number of technology personnel and contract staff, rely on a number of critical technology vendors, and make capital expenditures primarily on capitalized software costs, information technology and telecommunications equipment, reflecting investments in our IT capability.

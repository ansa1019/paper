The company discloses that its businesses depend on keeping pace with technological developments and on acquiring, developing, adopting and leveraging new and existing technologies—including evolving wireless internet standards such as 4G and 5G, advanced fiber-based networks and digital distribution platforms—and that new technologies can materially impact demand, distribution methods, customer viewing and purchasing behaviors and available advertising channels. It has undertaken significant technology initiatives such as the deployment of Flex and Sky Q set-top boxes, wireless gateways and new smart televisions based on its global technology platform and the launch and operation of Peacock, and continues to invest in software development and related capital. The company relies on third-party vendors to supply essential hardware, software and operational support—and to grant rights to incorporate vendor intellectual property—so that any vendor capacity constraints, financial difficulties or breaches of specification could adversely affect service delivery and costs. Its network and information systems and other related technologies—embedded across network management, customer service operations and programming delivery—are critical business assets that face constant attempts at intrusion and cyber attack (including viruses, denial-of-service, phishing and social engineering), which require costly, ongoing monitoring, security architecture enhancements and extensive programs to prevent and remediate incidents. Moreover, because it incorporates extensive open-source software, third-party applications, data hosting and cloud-based services into its products and operations, it is exposed to additional supplier risks and potential compromises of confidential, proprietary and personal information. The company also depends on its intellectual property portfolio—patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets—under complex licensing arrangements with vendors and third parties and may incur unfavorable terms, liability or injunctions if challenged. Consequently, failures in technology selection or execution, inability to execute on technology initiatives, rapid competitive or regulatory changes or security breaches could impair its operational flexibility, increase costs, weaken its ability to support and enhance its business strategies and work processes, compromise information reliability and confidentiality and diminish its competitive positioning in a dynamic digital environment.

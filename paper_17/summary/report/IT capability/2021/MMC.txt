The company relies on the efficient, uninterrupted and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate its business and securely process, transmit and store electronic information, including personal, confidential and proprietary data, and it faces risks from cyberattacks, malware, ransomware, supply-chain attacks via software updates, insider threats and evolving vulnerabilities in mobile devices, cloud services, open source platforms and internet-connected control systems. Furthermore, the company acknowledges ongoing challenges in managing access controls, patching and upgrading software, deploying safeguards such as data encryption and multi-factor authentication, and continually investing in technology infrastructure and capitalized software development to support digital business processes and strategic initiatives in a cost- and resource-efficient manner. Failure to protect data, to detect or respond promptly to security breaches or to comply with global privacy, data security and cybersecurity regulations (including GDPR, CCPA, Schrems II and various state and international requirements) could materially harm its financial results, reputation and operational flexibility. The company’s business performance and growth plans are also dependent on its ability to develop and implement improvements in technology, to respond effectively to digital disruption from traditional and insurtech competitors leveraging AI, data analytics, robotics, blockchain and digital platforms, and to execute strategic investments and partnerships in technology companies while integrating acquired businesses’ information systems on a timely basis, all of which reflect its broader IT capability in coordinating assets, internal processes and interfirm relationships and in mobilizing IT resources to enhance its competitive positioning and support business transformation.

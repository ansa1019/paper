The risk factors and management’s discussion emphasize that the company has had to adapt its information technology capabilities in response to the covid-19 pandemic, noting that “the recent shift to a remote working environment…could…impact the ability of our employees and vendors to work with the same speed and productivity” and that the pandemic “has driven organizations across the globe to digitize their operations and support remote workforces at a faster speed and greater scale than ever before.” Management warns of potential “IT-related capital spending reductions, or shifts in spending focus” that could “materially adversely affect us if we are unable to adjust our product and service offerings to match customer needs,” and it affirms its ongoing transformation “to move from selling individual products and services to selling products and services integrated into architectures and solutions.” The company describes its strategy to “integrate our platforms across networking, security, collaboration, applications and the cloud” in order to “provide customers with a highly secure, intelligent platform for their digital business,” and it observes that “our customers are looking for outcomes that are data-driven and provide meaningful business value through automation, security, and analytics across private, hybrid, and multicoud environments.” To sustain these capabilities, Cisco continues to “invest in personnel and other resources related to our engineering, sales, service and marketing functions” and to partner with key suppliers—“utilizing our volume purchasing and extending supply coverage, including revising supplier arrangements, to address supply chain challenges”—while pursuing “value engineering efforts (e.g., component redesign, board configuration, test processes and transformation processes) and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations” to drive productivity improvements that leverage its IT-based resources alongside other organizational assets.

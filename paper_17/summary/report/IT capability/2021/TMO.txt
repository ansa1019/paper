The company discloses that it has undertaken an ongoing effort to upgrade its information systems—including periodic implementations of new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications—to manage certain business operations, and that it relies on these systems to process, transmit and store sensitive electronic information (including confidential business information and personally identifiable data) and to support critical processes such as supplier interactions, order management, billing, payments, shipping, customer support, contractual compliance and overall business conduct. It warns that system upgrades or modifications can lead to service interruptions, data loss or reduced functionality and that failures to provide accurate pricing and cost data could adversely affect results. The company further acknowledges that certain systems are not redundant and that its disaster-recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality, leaving it vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures, cyber-attacks (including hacking, viruses, ransomware, phishing and denial-of-service attacks), terrorist acts and unauthorized access. A significant disruption of, or breach in security of, its information technology systems—or a violation of global data-privacy and security requirements—could materially interrupt operations, delay production and shipments, damage its reputation, result in theft of intellectual property or trade secrets, impair customer and partner relationships, produce defective products or services, invite legal claims and regulatory penalties and increase security and remediation costs. The company also cites e-business capabilities and the development of commercial tools, infrastructure and e-commerce platforms among key competitive factors and strategic growth investments intended to support cross-selling, expand geographic reach and enhance the customer experience.

The company’s disclosures emphasize that information technology capability is fundamental to virtually all aspects of its business, noting that “information technology is critical to the success of our digital products, helps us operate efficiently, interface with customers, maintain our supply chain and manufacturing operations, operate effectively and efficiently, maintain financial accuracy and efficiency, and accurately produce our financial statements.” It warns that failure “to allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure” or to keep “data management systems [that] effectively collect, store, process, and report relevant data” could expose it to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, business disruptions, impaired planning and forecasting, and delays in financial reporting. The shift to fully remote and hybrid work models has “heightened vulnerability to cyber attacks,” increased operational risks, and driven “increased costs to ensure our offices are safe and functional” for both remote and in-person collaboration. The company further acknowledges that “an information technology systems interruption, including cybersecurity attacks, could adversely affect the ordering, distribution, and manufacturing processes of our suppliers” and that “unauthorized persons may attempt to hack into our products or systems to obtain personal data” or sabotage systems containing intellectual property and personally identifiable information. To guard against such threats, it employs user names and passwords, encryption and authentication technologies, and maintains security programs for its own systems and those of third-party vendors, while recognizing that “these security measures may be compromised as a result of security breaches by unauthorized persons, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management, or other irregularity.” It also underscores the complexity and cost of complying with evolving global privacy, data-protection, and cybersecurity laws and regulations—such as HIPAA, the GDPR, the CCPA, the UK GDPR, and analogous statutes in Israel and elsewhere—as well as the need to align with multiple standards (for example, ISO quality system requirements) to continue manufacturing and selling products; any material deficiencies in these areas could require it “to cease all or part of our operations” or incur substantial fines, litigation costs, and reputational harm.

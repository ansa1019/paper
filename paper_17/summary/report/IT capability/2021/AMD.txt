AMD discloses that its business is dependent upon the proper functioning of its internal business processes and information systems and warns that modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt operations, processes and internal controls. In the ordinary course of business it maintains sensitive data on its information technology (IT) assets and acknowledges that IT outages, data loss, data breaches and cyber-attacks could compromise its intellectual property or other sensitive information, be costly to remediate or cause significant damage to its business, reputation and operations. It further notes that its network and storage applications, as well as those of its customers, business partners and third-party providers, have been and may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers, insider threats or state-sponsored attacks, and that the increased prevalence of work-from-home arrangements has presented additional operational and cybersecurity risks to its IT systems. The company emphasizes that the White House, the SEC and other regulators have increased their focus on companies’ cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks. AMD states that it relies on a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key business functions and that these systems need to be sufficiently scalable to support business growth, requiring continual evolution, adaptation, modification and upgrades to meet evolving business needs and regulatory and compliance requirements. As its IT environment evolves, the company is embracing new ways of communicating and sharing data internally and externally with customers and partners—such as mobility and the cloud—to promote business efficiency, while recognizing that these practices can create a more distributed IT environment that is harder to monitor and control. It also outsources to third parties certain supply-chain logistics functions, including portions of its product distribution, transportation management and IT support services, and underscores the importance of enhancing and implementing information security controls, training employees, investigating and remediating any data security breaches, and complying with external regulations. Finally, AMD highlights the necessity of protecting its technology and intellectual property globally through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements to maintain competitive advantage and prevent misappropriation, and it maintains confidential and personally identifiable information about its workers and consumers in compliance with laws such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act.

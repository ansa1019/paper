We are dependent upon information technology systems, infrastructure and data, including our Kite Konnect platform, which is critical to maintain the chain of identity and chain of custody of Yescarta and Tecartus. The multitude and complexity of our computer systems make them inherently vulnerable to service interruption or destruction, malicious intrusion and ransomware attack, and data privacy or security breaches by employees or others can result in the exposure of sensitive data, including our intellectual property or trade secrets or the personal information of our employees, patients, customers or other business partners to unauthorized persons or to the public. Cybersecurity incidents are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, including during the COVID-19 pandemic, and include the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware, denial-of-service, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten data confidentiality, integrity and availability. Our business and technology partners face similar risks, and any security breach of their systems could adversely affect our security posture. Like many companies, we have experienced cybersecurity incidents, including data breaches and service interruptions, and when such incidents occur, we respond and address them in accordance with applicable governmental regulations and our cybersecurity protocols. There can be no assurance that our efforts in response to cybersecurity incidents, as well as our investments to protect our information technology infrastructure and data, will shield us from significant losses and potential liability or prevent future interruptions or breaches of our systems. Such cybersecurity incidents can cause the loss of critical or sensitive information, including personal information, and could give rise to legal liability and regulatory action under data protection and privacy laws. Regulators globally are imposing new data privacy and security requirements, including new and greater monetary fines for privacy violations; for example, the European Unionâ€™s General Data Protection Regulation establishes regulations regarding the handling of personal data, non-compliance with which may result in monetary penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue, and emerging domestic laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act and the California Privacy Rights Act similarly introduce requirements with respect to personal information and may result in private liability for non-compliance.

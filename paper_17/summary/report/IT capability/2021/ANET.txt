Arista Networks acknowledges that the networking market is rapidly evolving, with end customers increasingly deploying virtualization and cloud computing, and thus generates revenue from integrated hardware/software products and post-contract support that facilitate the coordination of internal assets, processes and inter-firm transactions. Our cloud networking solutions, comprising the Extensible Operating System (EOS), network applications and Ethernet switching and routing platforms, deliver high performance, scalability, availability, programmability, automation and visibility to support business strategies and work processes. We have extended operational consistency and cognitive cloud networking principles to enterprise data centers and campus workspaces by enhancing the accuracy, reliability, security, connectivity and access of information management capabilities while investing in substantial software development for new products and features. The COVID-19 pandemic and global economic conditions have imposed manufacturing disruptions, supply chain shortages, extended lead times and shifts in demand planning horizons, prompting us to mobilize IT-based resources, adjust demand forecasts, increase purchase commitments and collaborate with third-party contract manufacturers to mitigate risks and maintain operational efficiency. Our products must interoperate with third-party operating systems, applications and hardware, and we proactively manage third-party software license compliance, open source obligations and intellectual property risks to preserve our competitive advantage. We invest heavily in research and development and work closely with merchant silicon vendors to ensure our network platforms meet evolving technological requirements and regulatory standards. High-quality support and services delivered through our global support organization and channel partners are critical to ensuring timely deployment, customer satisfaction and resilience against long, unpredictable sales cycles, variable capital spending and macroeconomic uncertainties that influence information technology and network infrastructure investments. Our organizational capability and strategic resource allocation emphasize dynamic capabilities, process optimization and technology integration to respond to market dynamics, regulatory contexts and environmental turbulence, thereby creating business value, enabling digital transformation and sustaining firm performance.

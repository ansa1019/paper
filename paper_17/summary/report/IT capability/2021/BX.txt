Blackstone discloses that it relies heavily on its technology infrastructure and cloud-based platforms to support remote working arrangements and the administration of its funds, and that this reliance introduces security vulnerabilities—such as hacking, phishing and social engineering—particularly in periods of increased remote work, as well as risks from third-party service providers’ platform failures. The firm emphasizes that its business is highly dependent on analytical, financial, accounting, communications and other data-processing systems, which face ongoing cybersecurity threats from external actors including cyber criminals, nation-state hackers and insiders, any of which could lead to data loss, system outages, financial theft, regulatory intervention and reputational damage. Blackstone further highlights the accelerating complexity of global privacy and data protection regimes such as the GDPR and CCPA, which impose stringent breach-notification and compliance obligations, and notes that its shift from on-premise infrastructure to third-party cloud services—and its disaster recovery and business continuity programs—may not fully mitigate operational disruptions or technology failures, while the firm must continually update and enhance its information systems to accommodate growth or face increased costs or reduced effectiveness.

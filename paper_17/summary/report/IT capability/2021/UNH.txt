The company emphasizes that failure to maintain properly the integrity or availability of its data or to successfully consolidate, integrate, upgrade or expand its existing information systems, or if its technology products do not operate as intended, could materially and adversely affect its business. It acknowledges that its operations depend on the integrity and timeliness of rapidly expanding volumes of health care data, including electronic health records, to implement new and innovative services, price products and services adequately, serve customers in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion and report results accurately. The importance of connectivity among technologies is underscored by recent trends toward greater consumer engagement in health care, which require new and enhanced technologies, including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices. The company’s information systems demand an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and to develop new systems that keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards as well as changing customer preferences. It periodically consolidates, integrates, upgrades and expands its information systems’ capabilities through technology initiatives, changes in system platforms and the integration of new business acquisitions, but warns that failure to protect, consolidate and integrate its systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of management’s time and energy, thereby materially and adversely affecting results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Certain businesses sell and install software products that may contain unexpected design defects or encounter integration complications, and any failure of these technology products to operate as intended could materially and adversely affect results of operations. The company also faces an uncertain and rapidly evolving legal and regulatory landscape related to health data and the health information technology market, which may alter the competitive environment or present compliance challenges that could materially and adversely affect the configuration of information systems and platforms and its ability to compete. It routinely processes, stores and transmits large amounts of data in its operations, including protected personal information subject to privacy, security or data breach notification laws, and proprietary or confidential information, making it a frequent target of cyber-attacks and other security threats that could lead to loss of revenue, increased costs, significant liability, reputational harm and other serious negative consequences. While programs are in place to detect, contain and respond to data security incidents and provide employee awareness training, the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently, and hardware, software or applications procured from third parties may contain defects or vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit. Reliance on third-party vendors to process, store and transmit data further exposes the company to similar risks, and the costs to eliminate or address these security threats and vulnerabilities could be material; remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service and loss of customers. Compliance with a growing array of privacy, security and data laws, including the EU’s GDPR, Brazilian privacy legislation, PCI DSS and HIPAA as well as contractual requirements for third-party service providers, imposes ongoing obligations and costs, and any noncompliance or breach involving the misappropriation, loss or unauthorized disclosure of protected personal information could materially and adversely affect reputation, business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In its strategic planning and management discussion, the company highlights investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems as part of delivery system and payment modernization, and it views growth opportunities in leveraging data and analytics to provide the necessary information to close gaps in care and improve overall health outcomes, thereby underscoring the critical role of IT capability in supporting and enhancing its business strategies and work processes.

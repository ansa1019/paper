We rely on sophisticated information technology systems—including software, mobile applications, cloud services and network-connected control systems, some of which are managed, hosted, provided or serviced by third parties—to support our research, development, manufacturing, distribution and commercial operations, and a breakdown, cyberattack or information-security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of these systems and our data, interrupt our business, harm our reputation or impair our ability to meet customer or regulatory requirements. As the majority of our employees work remotely, our dependence on both our own and third-party IT systems has increased substantially and is expected to continue to increase; the complexity and interconnected nature of these systems makes them inherently vulnerable to service interruptions and emerging cyber-threats, including harmful malware (such as ransomware), denial-of-service attacks, vulnerabilities introduced by software updates or open-source code, and attacks on our software supply chain or on critical vendors. Our systems and those of our suppliers and service providers also contain high volumes of sensitive data—ranging from intellectual property, trade secrets, product-development data, regulatory information, strategic plans and financial information to personal data of staff, patients or other parties—and unauthorized access or inadvertent disclosure arising from cyberattacks, lapses by employees or service providers, or breaches at third-party partners could expose or corrupt that data, disrupt our use of key business systems, trigger regulatory enforcement actions and have a material adverse effect on our operations. We continue to invest in monitoring, protection and resilience measures for our critical and sensitive data and systems and maintain cyber-liability insurance, but there can be no assurances that our efforts will fully detect, prevent or recover from all breakdowns, attacks or breaches, particularly in light of the evolving cyber-threat landscape and continuous regulatory developments such as the European Union’s GDPR and U.S. state privacy laws, which impose stringent requirements on the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer and security of personal data.

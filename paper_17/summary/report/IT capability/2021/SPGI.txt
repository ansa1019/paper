Operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential, sensitive and other types of data and information in our computer systems and networks and those of our third-party vendors, with our business continuity program depending in part on the availability of our personnel, our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations, including backup facilities for our primary data centers. We are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity and protection of confidential information—from cyber attacks common to most industries to sophisticated state-sponsored actors—and have noted an increase in cyber threats targeted at our remote work environment; moreover, vulnerabilities in widely deployed third-party software such as log4j require us to devote time and resources to remediation on a regular basis. Unauthorized disclosure of material non-public information could damage customer relationships and our reputation, while breaches in our or our vendors’ systems may cause interruptions, compromise the integrity of material information and lead to reputational harm, regulatory actions and legal liability. Outsourcing functions to third-party service providers involves the risk that they may not maintain adequate physical, technical and administrative safeguards, may not perform in a timely manner or may fail to perform at all, and our plans to increase the amount of our infrastructure that we outsource to “the cloud” or to other third parties may increase our risk exposure. Many of our products and services are delivered electronically over network systems and the internet, and the integrity of our electronic delivery systems, websites and IT infrastructure is critical to meeting customer needs; delays or disruptions caused by infrastructure or network failures, malicious or defective software, human error, physical breaches, cyber incidents or telecommunications failures could materially affect our productivity, operational flexibility, process optimization and overall firm performance. Although we have disaster recovery plans with backup facilities for our primary data centers, our systems are not always fully redundant—particularly in smaller office locations—and our disaster planning may not always be sufficient or effective if a significant event affects key operating areas. We devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update our technology infrastructure, security measures, monitoring systems, incident response capabilities and data management tools designed to protect the security, confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to the enterprise and our customers, clients and employees, and to adapt to evolving regulatory requirements for data protection and privacy; however, the effectiveness of these measures cannot be guaranteed, and any material IT-related incident could adversely impact our ability to support business needs, execute strategic decisions, leverage technology resources and sustain competitive advantage.

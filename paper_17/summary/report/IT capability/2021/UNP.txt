The Company discloses that it relies on information technology in all aspects of its business, encompassing systems operated internally or under third‐party control or based on open‐source software, and that if it fails to deploy sufficient capital in a timely manner to acquire, develop, or upgrade systems such as positive train control or its transportation control systems, it may incur a competitive disadvantage; it further states that it devotes significant resources to protect its technology systems and proprietary data but continues to experience cyber incidents due to an increasingly complex IT supply chain, sophisticated attack methods, and zero-day exploits, and that successful security breaches could lead to significant service interruptions, safety failures, operational difficulties, unauthorized access to critical data and systems, loss of customers, financial losses, regulatory fines, and misuse of proprietary information which may remain undetected for extended periods; in its management’s discussion and analysis, the Company reports ongoing investments in technology and software, including implementation of a physics engine and proprietary software to evaluate train and route characteristics for proactive derailment interventions, and outlines plans for its operating practices command center to expand predictive technology deployment to reduce variability by identifying causes of mainline service interruptions and developing solutions, reflecting the firm’s focus on mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with other assets to support business strategies, operational efficiency, and competitive performance.

During periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services, we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems, and procedures for training, assimilating, and managing our workforce, and in appropriately sizing our supply chain infrastructure and facilities on a timely basis, and we continuously reassess our strategic resource allocation choices in response to the changing business environment. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented modifications to our business processes, business continuity plans, development and qualification of alternative sources of supply, changes to existing manufacturing processes and teleworking by a large proportion of our workforce. Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate due to transportation, communication, demand, information technology or supply disruptions based on factors outside our control. We maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business, including telecommunications, the internet, our corporate intranet, various computer hardware and software applications (some of which may be integrated into the products that we sell or required to provide the services that we offer), network communications, email and software-as-a-service products provided by third parties, all of which rely on networks, email and/or the internet for their function. These information systems, which may be owned and maintained by us, our outsourced providers or third parties such as vendors, contractors, customers and cloud providers, are subject to disruption, breach or failure from sources including mistakes or unauthorized actions by employees or contractors, phishing schemes, third-party attacks, viruses, malware, denial of service attacks, destructive or inadequate code, power failures or physical damage to computers, communication lines or networking equipment. Although we have implemented ISO 27001-compliant security procedures and virus protection software, intrusion prevention systems, identity and access control and emergency recovery processes, and we carefully select our third-party providers of information systems to mitigate risks to our technology, data, intellectual property and other sensitive information, those measures cannot be guaranteed to be fail-safe, and we may still experience cybersecurity or other incidents that we may be unable to identify or respond to in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

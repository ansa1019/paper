Abbottâ€™s disclosures indicate that the company depends on sophisticated information technology systems and protected personal data infrastructures whose complexity and scale render them susceptible to cyber attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy or other significant disruption, and that these systems have been and are expected to continue to be targeted by malware and other cyber threats. Abbott collects, manages and processes protected personal data, including health information, under regional and local data protection laws that restrict cross-border data transfers, and a breach of this data could result in regulatory inquiries or litigation, increased costs and expenses, reputational damage, lost revenue and fines or penalties. To mitigate these risks, Abbott invests in its systems and technology and in the protection of its products and data, monitors its systems on an ongoing basis for current or potential threats or vulnerabilities and for changes in technology and the regulatory environment, and contracts with third-party information technology providers, although it acknowledges there can be no assurance such measures will prevent future attacks or disruptions or that providers will not suffer significant incidents affecting Abbott. In its capital expenditure plan, Abbott further specifies that a portion of its multi-billion dollar investments is allocated to upgrading and expanding information technology capabilities across manufacturing, research and development facilities and customer-placed laboratory instruments.

We rely heavily on our financial, accounting and other data-processing systems and on the systems of third parties who provide services to us, and any failure of these information systems and technology to operate properly, accommodate our growth, support new products or strategies (including the transition from LIBOR to SOFR) or protect client information could cause disruptions to our businesses, losses, liability to our funds, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. In particular, our public markets business is highly dependent on our ability to process and evaluate transactions across markets and geographies on a time-sensitive, efficient and accurate basis, and we also face operational risk from errors in execution, confirmation or settlement of transactions, reliance on manual processes, and transactions not properly recorded or accounted for in our funds. Extended periods of remote working by our employees could strain our technology resources and introduce operational risks, including heightened cybersecurity risk, because remote environments may be less secure and more susceptible to ransomware, phishing and social-engineering attacks. We are dependent on an increasingly concentrated group of third-party vendors that we do not control for hosting solutions and technologies, and any disaster or disruption in infrastructure, electronic communications or other services used by us, our vendors or third parties such as paying agents and escrow agents could have a material adverse impact on our ability to operate without interruption, and our business-continuity and disaster-recovery programs may not be sufficient to mitigate the harm that could result from such a disruption. Finally, we rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential information in our computer systems and networks, and any cybersecurity failures or data-security breaches—exacerbated by evolving threats, including by state actors—could result in the loss or misuse of proprietary, client or policyholder data, operational interruptions, regulatory investigations, penalties and significant reputational damage.

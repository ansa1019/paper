Our information technology systems—whether cloud-based or hosted in proprietary servers—serve as the backbone for critical operations, encompassing point-of-sale processing and payment in our stores and online channels, web and mobile platforms, delivery services, loyalty and rewards programs, and a range of administrative functions, many of which are interdependent and supported by third-party providers. We have made incremental strategic investments in technology and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes designed to anticipate cyber-attacks, prevent or minimize security breaches, and ensure data accuracy, timeliness, confidentiality and connectivity in compliance with complex privacy and data protection regulations such as the GDPR, CCPA and similar international and state laws. The accelerated transformation of our store portfolio toward convenience-led formats—such as mobile ordering, curbside pickup and new digital store formats—depends heavily on robust mobile ordering capabilities and the expansion of digital relationships with customers. We rely on IT infrastructure and platforms to manage supply chain logistics, monitor the operations of licensees and business partners, allocate resources, and support corporate administrative functions, and our incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans remain essential to maintaining operational flexibility, performance resilience and competitive advantage in a rapidly evolving digital and regulatory environment.

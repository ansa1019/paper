To protect our employees and in response to the global and regional restrictions on interpersonal contact and travel because of the pandemic, much of our workforce has been working remotely, placing increased demands on our IT systems, and while we have continued to conduct our business effectively throughout the pandemic, there is no assurance that our ability to continue to function in this environment will not be adversely affected by an extended disruption in the telecommunications and internet infrastructures that support our remote work capability. Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information and assets in our computer systems and networks and those of third-party service providers, and our ability to adequately price products and services, to establish reserves, to provide effective, efficient and secure service to our customers, to value our investments and to timely and accurately report our financial results depends significantly on the integrity, availability and timeliness of the data our information systems use to run our business. Although we have implemented administrative and technical controls and undertaken protective actions to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and to protect our information technology and assets, and we continually seek to modify such procedures and negotiate agreements with third-party providers, such measures may be insufficient to prevent unauthorized access, computer viruses, malware, cyber-attacks, catastrophic events, system failures and disruptions, employee errors or malfeasance, third-party errors or malfeasance or other security events, each of which could jeopardize Chubb’s or its clients’ or counterparties’ confidential and other information, result in data or asset loss or interruptions in critical business functions, or expose us to litigation costs, regulatory enforcement actions, fines, criminal prosecution, reputational damage and financial losses that may be uninsured or underinsured. We are subject to extensive and evolving privacy and data security regulations, including the New York Department of Financial Services’ Cybersecurity Regulation, the NAIC Insurance Data Security Model Law, the EU General Data Protection Regulation, the California Consumer Privacy Act and California Privacy Rights Act, Brazil’s Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados, and other comparable laws worldwide, each of which imposes detailed cybersecurity and information security requirements, increases compliance costs, heightens the risk of enforcement actions and penalties, and could materially affect our use of and ability to manage data. Exposure to cyber risk is increasing systematically due to greater digital dependence, and cyber risks—engineered by human actors to evade established controls—are continuously evolving, underscoring the need for ongoing investment in platform resilience, data management, information security, systems capability and technical controls.

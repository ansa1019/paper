Bank of America’s ability to operate its critical business functions and deliver products and services to customers depends fundamentally on its information technology infrastructure and systems—whether owned or provided by third parties—together with its data management and security frameworks, which it continuously updates and expands through significant investments in emerging technologies such as automation, artificial intelligence, cloud solutions and mobile platforms.  The firm’s information management capability is designed to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity and access, with the ability to tailor these services in response to changing business needs, and is integral to its efforts to mobilize IT-based resources in combination with organizational and human capital to achieve operational flexibility, support digital banking and remote-work environments, and maintain effective business continuity plans and backup systems.  Bank of America regularly implements changes to its systems to support digital innovation and enhance its network of retail financial centers, ATMs, call centers and leading digital platforms, and it closely monitors, detects and responds to technology failures, cyberattacks, information or security breaches, emerging software and hardware vulnerabilities, prolonged network outages, and other operational disruptions, any of which could adversely impact its operations, results of operations, risk management processes, compliance with regulatory requirements and its reputation.  Cybersecurity, information security and privacy are prioritized through a multilayered intelligence-led program, routine vulnerability assessments, third-party risk management and incident-response protocols, and the firm maintains cyber insurance and dedicated governance structures to ensure that technology initiatives and digital transformation efforts align with strategic objectives and deliver competitive advantage.

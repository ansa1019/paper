Our disclosures describe a broad range of activities and exposures that, although not labeled “IT capability,” reflect our ongoing efforts to acquire, deploy, integrate and secure technology resources in support of our business strategies and processes.  We report significant investments in network build-out, including deployment of our nationwide 5G network, acquisitions of spectrum licenses and continuous upgrades to our systems and infrastructure to meet evolving customer demands and competitive pressures.  We rely on complex networks and business systems—both our own and those of third-party suppliers—to provide, bill for and support our services, and we depend on these systems for information processing, data management, connectivity and customer relationship management.  The pandemic has introduced additional operational and cybersecurity risks to our IT environment through expanded work-from-home arrangements, requiring continual evaluation, enhancement and capital investment in our safeguards, monitoring systems and change management practices.  Unauthor­ized access or disruption of our IT networks, systems and supply chain—whether through cyberattack, equipment failure, supplier delays or human error—could impair operations, degrade service quality, compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of information, and increase remediation expenses and legal liabilities.  We also depend on skilled personnel, consulting and professional services to maintain and optimize our digital infrastructure, software development and administrative platforms, and we require flexible, scalable IT resources and governance practices to integrate acquisitions, manage vendor relationships, execute customer migrations and support new product launches.  Moreover, adopting sophisticated technologies exposes us to implementation risks—scheduling constraints, regulatory permitting, supplier performance, cost overruns and customer dissatisfaction—which may delay the realization of anticipated benefits or cost savings.  Collectively, these disclosures underscore the critical role of mobilizing, deploying and securing IT-based resources in coordination with other organizational capabilities to sustain our competitive position, operational resilience and future growth.

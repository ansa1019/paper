We rely extensively on information and operational technology (IT/OT) systems, networks and services—including internet and intranet sites, data-hosting and processing facilities, physical security systems, hardware, software, applications and platforms managed or hosted by third parties—to assist in conducting our business, from ordering and managing materials, converting raw materials to finished products and shipping to customers, to marketing and selling products, collecting, transferring, storing and processing stakeholder information and personal data under evolving privacy regulations, summarizing and reporting financial and operational results, managing banking and cash liquidity platforms, hosting and sharing confidential research, business plans and financial information, collaborating through global online communications, complying with regulatory, legal and tax requirements, providing data security and supporting all other processes necessary to manage our operations. Our global business services organization provides technology, processes and standard data tools to sector business units, enterprise markets and corporate functions, enabling deeper business insights and more effective consumer engagement, including support for evolving digital marketing and selling platforms—such as e-commerce, mobile and social commerce applications. We recognize the risk that a significant information security or OT incident, including a cybersecurity breach or the failure of key IT/OT systems, networks, hardware, processes or third-party services, could interrupt operations, damage our reputation, expose us to litigation or regulatory action and require substantial remediation and capital investment. Numerous and evolving cyber threats—advanced persistent threats, malware, ransomware, phishing, social engineering, unauthorized access attempts or insider actors—pose ongoing challenges to the confidentiality, integrity, availability and reliability of our systems and data, and periodic upgrades or adoption of new technologies may introduce further vulnerabilities that could materially and adversely affect our ability to order materials, manufacture and ship products, process payments and safeguard critical information.

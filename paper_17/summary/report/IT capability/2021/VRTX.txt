We maintain and rely extensively on information technology systems and network infrastructures for the effective operation of our business and, in the course of our business, collect, store and transmit confidential information (including personal information and intellectual property) in a secure manner to maintain confidentiality and integrity. A disruption, infiltration or failure of our information technology systems or any of our data centers—whether caused by software or hardware malfunctions, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, employee theft or misuse, power disruptions, natural disasters or accidents—could cause breaches of data security, loss of critical data and materially adversely affect our business and expose us to private and governmental claims. We have implemented security measures and adopted a business continuity plan to address potential disruptions, but we face increasing risks from cyber-attacks (including malware, ransomware, denial-of-service, supply-chain attacks and other sophisticated techniques) that are becoming more difficult to detect, and our increased use of cloud technologies, reliance on third-party service providers and remote working arrangements heighten these operational and security risks, any of which could interrupt or impair critical business processes.

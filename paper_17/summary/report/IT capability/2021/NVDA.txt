NVIDIA relies upon internal processes and information systems to support key business functions, including our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the efficient operation of these processes and systems is critical and needs to be scalable to support our growth, including for acquisitions of other businesses. We expect in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 to commence implementation of accounting and consolidation functionality related to a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system; any ERP system problems upon implementation, such as quality issues or programming errors, could impact our continued ability to successfully operate our business or to timely and accurately report our financial results. We rely on products and services provided by third-party suppliers to operate certain critical business systems, including, without limitation, cloud-based infrastructure, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, and other functions, which exposes us to supply-chain attacks or other business disruptions. Security breaches, computer malware, social-engineering attacks, denial-of-service attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, and other cyber-attacks are increasingly sophisticated, making it more difficult to successfully detect, defend against them or implement adequate preventative measures. Upon learning of the security incident on February 23, 2022, involving unauthorized access to our network by independent criminal threat actors, we engaged in remedial and preventative actions, rotated all network credentials to prevent further unauthorized access, hardened our network, analyzed the information that the threat actors exfiltrated, and notified law enforcement and other authorities. Our ability to monitor third parties’ information security practices is limited, and these may not have adequate information security measures in place. We must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features, which is expected to result in increased expenses, continue to develop our security measures, ensure our suppliers have appropriate security measures in place, and continue to meet the evolving security requirements of our customers. Our products and services may provide us with access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, industry standards, external and internal policies, contracts and other obligations that govern the processing of such data by us and on our behalf; concerns about our practices or the ultimate use of our products and services with regard to the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal information or other privacy-related matters, including for use in AI, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data in our possession or by one of our partners could result in damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business activities or increased security costs and costs related to defending legal claims, and if we are found not to comply with regulations such as the GDPR, we could be subject to penalties of up to €20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue.

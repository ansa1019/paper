We disclose that our business is dependent on information technology networks and systems “to securely process, transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our people, clients, alliance partners and vendors,” and that “as the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure continues to grow, including as a result of the increasing reliance on, and use of, mobile technologies, social media and cloud-based services, and as more of our employees are working remotely,” the risk of security incidents and cyberattacks increases. We acknowledge that “technological developments may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients and, in the case of cloud and as-a-service solutions, could affect the nature of how we generate revenue,” and that clients may “delay spending under existing contracts and engagements and to delay entering into new contracts while they evaluate new technologies,” which “can negatively impact our results of operations if we are unable to introduce new pricing or commercial models.” We emphasize that “our success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and offerings to serve the evolving needs of our clients,” citing areas such as “digital-, cloud- and security-related offerings,” “artificial intelligence, augmented reality, automation, blockchain, internet of things, quantum and edge computing, infrastructure and network engineering, intelligent connected products, digital engineering and manufacturing, and as-a-service solutions,” and that our “growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation that will enable us to expand our business into new growth areas.” We further note that in providing services we “often manage, utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or Accenture data, including personal data and proprietary information, and we expect these activities to increase, including through the use of artificial intelligence, the internet of things and analytics,” subject to evolving privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. We describe our need to “anticipate and respond to continuous changes in technology and develop alliance relationships with new providers of relevant technology” in order to “differentiate our services or compete effectively in the market,” and we report that fiscal 2021 performance was driven by “strong demand for digital transformation” as we “help our clients build their digital core, transform their operations, and accelerate revenue growth—creating tangible value across their enterprises at speed and scale,” including “application modernization and maintenance, cloud enablement and managed security services” and “transforming operations through data and analytics, automation and artificial intelligence to drive productivity and operational cost savings.”

Stryker discloses that it relies extensively on information technology systems to conduct business, including networks and services such as internet sites, cloud and SaaS solutions, data hosting and processing facilities, hardware, software (including open source software) and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third-parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting its business. The company warns that it could experience a failure of a key information technology system, process or site or a breach of information security—including a cybersecurity breach or failure of one or more key information technology systems, networks, processes, associated sites or service providers—which could impact its operations, product offerings and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of its data and expose it to reputational, competitive and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action. It acknowledges that numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats pose ongoing risks, that a greater number of employees working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic may increase its cyber-liability exposure, and that while it has made investments in network and system monitoring, expert personnel, employee training and security policies, the techniques used in attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect or anticipate. Stryker further states that it is subject to extensive global privacy, data protection and data security regulations—such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) and the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)—which establish comprehensive standards for the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, security, confidentiality and integrity of personal and protected health information and impose significant penalties for non-compliance. In its management’s discussion and analysis, the company describes the material undertaking of implementing a new global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system to replace many existing operating and financial systems and cautions that any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design or implementation of this new ERP system could adversely affect its ability to process orders, ship products, provide services and customer support, send invoices, track payments, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate its business.

The Company’s risk disclosures emphasize that cybersecurity events, breaches, disruptions or other incidents relating to its information technology systems or those of its customers, vendors and other third parties could compromise its information technology networks; result in corrupt or lost data or the unauthorized release of confidential or proprietary information; cause a disruption to its manufacturing and other operations; lead to the release of personal data; or cause it to incur costs associated with increased protection, remediation, regulatory inquiries or penalties or claims for damages, any of which could adversely affect its operating results and reputation, and that such cybersecurity or other threats are frequent and constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of defending against them. The Company further notes exposure to possible disruptions in transportation, communications and information technology networks amid varied political, social and economic conditions across its global operations and warns that a breach or other incident affecting suppliers’ information technology systems could likewise result in the release of confidential or proprietary information. In its strategic framework, the Company describes disciplined capital allocation that encompasses the selection of R&D projects and the development of new digital capabilities, such as its ti.com platform, to strengthen its technology resources, support evolving business needs and reinforce its competitive advantages.

Visa’s disclosures underscore its evolving information technology capability in several respects. In the Technology and Cybersecurity Risks section, the company warns that failure to anticipate, adapt to, or keep pace with rapid technological change—including mobile and in-app payment technologies, e-commerce, tokenization, cryptocurrencies, distributed ledger and blockchain technologies, and advanced authentication methods such as biometrics, 3D Secure 2.0 and dynamic cardholder verification values—could harm its ability to compete, diminish the value of its products and services to clients, and impair future growth. Visa cites its own initiatives and innovations, including its cross-border B2B payment service Visa B2B Connect and its advanced transaction processing network, VisaNet, which enables authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions across a global ecosystem, reflecting the firm’s competence in coordinating IT resources, governance and risk management to support business strategies and work processes. The company also highlights that any disruption, failure or breach of its networks or systems—from power outages, hardware, software or network failures, malware or cyber-attacks to supply-chain interruptions—could compromise the confidentiality, availability and integrity of data in its systems and those of financial institutions, merchants and third-party service providers, potentially causing operational disruptions, financial losses, reputational damage, regulatory sanctions, litigation, reduced transaction volumes and impediments to recovery despite business continuity measures. In addition, Visa notes that innovations in payment technology—such as tokenization, push payments and non-card-based flows—have expanded its product portfolio but introduced new licensing or authorization requirements and regulatory scrutiny, emphasizing the firm’s ongoing need to mobilize, deploy and reconfigure IT resources in combination with organizational processes and external relationships to maintain competitive advantage, operational flexibility and compliance in a dynamic market environment.

The Company acknowledges that its ability to acquire, deploy, combine and reconfigure information technology resources in support of its business strategies is critical to its ongoing transformation and competitive positioning, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, where it leveraged work-from-home infrastructure and accelerated remote physician support capabilities as part of its business continuity plans. It discloses reliance on complex IT systems, including third-party and internally developed applications, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and emphasizes the need for ongoing investment in its IT architecture, connectivity, data accuracy, timeliness, security, confidentiality and access controls to keep pace with rapid technological change, evolving regulatory standards and the growing importance of digital technologies across its R&D pipeline, product portfolio and operating environment. The Company further highlights the risks associated with cyber-attacks, malicious intrusions, vulnerabilities in third-party software (such as the log4j incident), ransomware threats and system failures, any of which could result in unauthorized access to patient data or proprietary information, operational disruption or harm to patients, and describes its governance framework, controls and escalation procedures for monitoring cybersecurity matters and ensuring compliance with global data privacy regulations, including GDPR and local data residency laws.

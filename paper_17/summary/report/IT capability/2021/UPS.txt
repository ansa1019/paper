Our operations depend critically on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet and numerous internally-developed systems and applications, to receive package-level information in advance of the physical receipt of packages, to move and track packages through our operations, to efficiently plan deliveries, to execute billing processes and to track and report financial and operational data; our franchise locations and subsidiaries likewise rely on IT systems to manage their business processes and activities.  We regularly move significant amounts of proprietary and sensitive data across national borders and are subject to evolving privacy, data protection and security regulations, and we depend on and interact with the IT networks and systems of customers, franchisees and third-party service providers (including cloud service providers and third-party delivery services), each of which may have access to information we maintain or to systems critical to our operations.  These information technology systems (ours and those of our affiliates and suppliers) are susceptible to programming errors, defects or other vulnerabilities, power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, ransomware, malware, theft, misconduct, telecommunications failures, human errors or other catastrophic events, any of which may cause service outages, block legitimate access or result in interruptions in our business, the loss or misuse of proprietary information or personally identifiable data, damage to our brand and reputation, or regulatory scrutiny, litigation and other liability.  Security processes, protocols, standards and contractual provisions may prove insufficient or ineffective to prevent such events, particularly as techniques to obtain unauthorized access or to disable, degrade or sabotage systems evolve rapidly and often are not recognized until deployed.  An actual or alleged failure to comply with applicable U.S. or foreign data protection regulations or other data protection standards may also expose us to litigation, fines, sanctions or other penalties.  We have made, and expect to continue to make, significant investments in technology security initiatives, information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans, and our innovation-driven strategic approach utilizes technology and automation to deliver sustainable improvements to our network and enhance the customer experience.  Additionally, our acquisition of Roadie, a technology platform focused on same-day delivery services, further expands our IT-based resource portfolio.

Nike’s risk disclosures and management discussion emphasize that the company is heavily dependent on complex information technology systems and digital capabilities—ranging from demand and supply planning and inventory control systems to its Nike Direct digital commerce platforms, mobile applications, social media integrations and enterprise IT infrastructure supporting product design, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales, distribution, financial reporting and retail operations—and that significant investments in digital technologies and information systems are required to develop, upgrade and integrate these platforms with third-party technologies, networks and standards while tailoring performance, security, connectivity, timeliness and access to evolving business needs. The company acknowledges challenges in implementing, operating and maintaining its increasingly complex IT systems and controls, including embedded factory currency-exposure derivatives, and warns that interruptions, system failures, cyber-attacks (such as phishing, malware or unauthorized access), natural disasters, vendor or vendor-system interruptions, work-from-home arrangements and failures to secure, repair or upgrade systems could delay product fulfillment, impede inventory management, disrupt financial, legal and tax reporting, compromise personal or consumer data, undermine compliance and business continuity plans and damage its reputation, revenues and profitability. Continued reliance on information technology for digital marketing, consumer engagement and electronic communications among employees, customers, suppliers and other third parties heightens Nike’s exposure to cybersecurity and data security risks, necessitating ongoing enhancements in IT governance, change management, resource deployment and systems integration to preserve operational efficiency, competitive advantage and emergent digital resilience.

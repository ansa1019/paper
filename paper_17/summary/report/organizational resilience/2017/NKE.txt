Nike’s annual report discloses a comprehensive set of exposures to internal and external pressures—“interruptions in data and information technology systems,” “transportation disruptions,” “business disruptions,” “extreme weather conditions and natural disasters,” “climate change,” “seasonality,” “currency exchange rate fluctuations,” “changes in consumer preferences,” “competitive pressures,” “political and economic instability,” and “regulatory changes”—and details resilience‐enhancing strategies designed to preserve or improve functioning under such adverse conditions.  These include centralized foreign exchange risk management and hedging of forecasted cash flows; maintenance of committed credit facilities and a commercial paper program to ensure liquidity; rigorous working capital and inventory planning processes; investment in advanced demand and supply planning, automation and supply chain technologies to reduce waste and accelerate speed to market; diversification of contract manufacturers to mitigate supply concentration; expansion of direct‐to‐consumer capabilities via digital commerce and a global retail footprint under the “consumer direct offense”; continuous enhancement of information systems and internal controls; comprehensive data security and privacy controls; disciplined management of uncollectible accounts and inventory reserves; and structured endorsement and operating lease commitments.  Collectively, these measures reflect Nike’s systemic approach to risk mitigation, operational flexibility, resource reconfiguration and continuity planning, enabling the company to absorb strain, respond to disruptions, adapt in real time and sustain performance across nominal, extreme or exceptional environmental, economic and competitive perturbations.

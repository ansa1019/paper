Our disclosures emphasize that our inability to successfully recover from a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem—such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood, terrorist attack, pandemic, security breach, cyberattack, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made disaster—could materially interrupt our business operations and result in material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships or legal liability. In such an event, our ability to continue to operate will depend, in part, on the availability of our personnel, our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations, and although we regularly assess and take steps to improve our existing business continuity plans and key management succession and maintain disaster recovery plans with backup facilities for our primary data centers, our systems are not always fully redundant, and our disaster planning may not always be sufficient or effective. We rely heavily on network systems and the internet to process transactions rapidly and deliver substantial quantities of data electronically, yet our ability to deliver products and services electronically may be impaired by infrastructure or network failures, malicious or defective software, human error, natural disasters, service outages at third-party internet providers or increased government regulation, any of which could lead to delays, interruptions or malfunctions that harm our reputation and result in the loss of customers. Some of our products rely on third-party suppliers and outsourcing arrangements, and failures by these providers to perform to our standards, meet legal requirements, maintain confidentiality of proprietary information or deliver services in a timely manner could also result in material financial loss, higher costs, regulatory actions and reputational harm. Our operations and those of our third-party vendors rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential, sensitive and other types of data and information, and breaches of our or our vendors’ systems—whether from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service attacks, hacking, computer viruses or malware, employee error, malfeasance, physical breaches or other actions—may compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of material information regarding us, our business or our customers, damage our brand and reputation, impair customer confidence, expose us to litigation and regulatory actions, and lead to losses that may not be insured or fully covered, and any actual or perceived breach of our security measures could further damage our reputation and result in sanctions, fines or demands to modify our business practices. Global privacy legislation, enforcement and policy activity is rapidly expanding and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment, and failure to comply with evolving federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws or regulations could result in penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue, negative publicity, increased operating costs, significant management time commitments and orders to modify or cease existing business practices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our businesses are privy to material non-public information concerning the company’s customers, and despite measures to deter insider trading by employees and third-party vendors, improper use of such information could harm our reputation and result in claims or litigation. Moreover, our ability to attract and retain key qualified personnel is essential to the development, maintenance and support of our products and services, and failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to deliver solutions and achieve our strategic goals. Finally, our brand and reputation are key assets and competitive advantages, and negative perceptions or publicity could damage our reputation with customers, prospects and the public generally, thereby undermining our ability to attract and retain customers, employees and suppliers.

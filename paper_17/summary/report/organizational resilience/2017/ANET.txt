The company acknowledges that its rapid growth and increased demand have placed a strain on its management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure and that its ability to continue growing depends on appropriately managing future growth by improving systems and processes—specifically through enhanced operational, financial and management controls and integrated information systems—to absorb strain and preserve functioning under internal and external pressures. It warns that failure to implement these improvements in an efficient or timely manner could disrupt current operations, damage end-customer relationships, impair forecasting and hinder its capacity to adapt to evolving market conditions. Recognizing that it operates in a rapidly evolving cloud networking market, the company emphasizes the importance of anticipating technological shifts, changing industry standards and end-customer needs and of developing product enhancements and new offerings in a timely manner to maintain competitive advantage and operational flexibility. It identifies complexities in its supply chain—including sole or limited sources of key components—and its reliance on third-party manufacturers and channel partners as potential points of failure that may lead to shortages, capacity constraints, quality issues or excess inventory, any of which could result in lost sales, reduced margins and diminished organizational resilience. The company further discloses that ongoing litigation and associated regulatory orders have required costly, time-consuming redesigns of its products and strained its resources, noting that customer qualification of these redesigns and potential enforcement or modification proceedings by the usitc may bar product entry into the United States, impose penalties or disrupt service and support unless further adaptations are made. It also recognizes that its global operations are exposed to natural disasters, geopolitical events, regulatory changes such as Brexit, cybersecurity breaches and other catastrophic risks, each of which underscores the need for robust disaster-recovery plans, continuity strategies and compliance frameworks to maintain system integrity, absorb disturbances and sustain performance under adverse or unexpected conditions. Finally, the company highlights its dependence on attracting, training and retaining qualified personnel, maintaining effective internal controls and complying with environmental, trade and anti-corruption laws as critical organizational capabilities necessary for resilience in the face of uncertainty and external disruptions.

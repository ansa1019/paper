All of our businesses operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and entertainment, news and information content, reflecting the need to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions. Online distribution platforms are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and influencing consumer behavior, which requires us to adapt our video service offerings to changing consumer behaviors, for example, by deploying our X1 platform and cloud DVR technology and adding apps such as Netflix on our X1 set-top boxes. Our cable communications business continues to seek ways to enhance the value of our cable services network, such as by growing our high-speed internet services and business services and by launching additional services, such as our security and automation services, illustrating resource allocation toward business continuity and service innovation. Our success is, to a large extent, dependent on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt and leverage new and existing technologies, and our competitors’ use of certain types of technology and equipment may provide them with a competitive advantage, underscoring the systemic perspective on technological adaptation. We also will continue to incur additional costs as we execute our technology initiatives, such as the deployment of DOCSIS 3.1 and DOCSIS FDX and the continued development of our X1 set-top boxes, cloud DVR and wireless gateways, indicating investment in organizational capabilities. We rely on network and information systems and other technologies, as well as key properties, and a disruption, cyber attack, failure or destruction of such networks, systems, technologies or properties may disrupt our businesses; network, information systems and technology-related events, including those caused by natural disasters, infectious disease outbreaks, terrorist attacks or other similar events, could result in a degradation or disruption of our products and services, and while we develop and maintain systems, and operate an extensive security program, seeking to prevent systems-related events and security breaches from occurring, there can be no assurance that they will not occur in the future or will not have an adverse effect on our businesses, reflecting our focus on risk mitigation, crisis management and recovery mechanisms. We depend on third-party vendors to supply us with a significant amount of the hardware, software and operational support necessary to provide certain of our services, and if any of these vendors experience operating or financial difficulties or are otherwise unable to meet our specifications or provide the equipment or services we need in a timely manner or at reasonable prices, our ability to provide some services may be adversely affected, illustrating inter-organizational collaboration and supply-chain resilience. Weak economic conditions could adversely affect demand for any of our products and services and have a negative impact on our results of operations, and weak economic conditions and turmoil in the global financial markets may also impair the ability of third parties to satisfy their obligations to us, demonstrating our need for financial resilience and operational flexibility under external pressures. In connection with acquisitions and strategic initiatives, we may incur unanticipated expenses, fail to realize anticipated benefits, have difficulty incorporating an acquired or new line of business, disrupt relationships with current and new employees, customers and vendors, incur significant debt, or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions or initiatives, highlighting the organizational change processes and adaptation strategies required to preserve or improve functioning. Many of NBCUniversal’s employees, including writers, directors, actors, technical and production personnel and others, as well as some of our on-air and creative talent employees, are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and if we are unable to reach agreement with a labor union before the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement, our employees who were covered by that agreement may have a right to strike or take other actions that could disrupt our operations and reduce our revenue, which underscores the importance of stakeholder engagement and recovery planning. Our cable networks depend on their ability to secure and maintain distribution agreements with traditional and virtual multichannel video providers, and if traditional and virtual multichannel video providers decide not to distribute our broadcast and cable networks, or if our distribution agreements are not renewed on acceptable terms, our businesses could be adversely affected, indicating the need to reconfigure distribution trajectories and maintain network integrity. We derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising, and a decline in expenditures by advertisers, including through traditional linear television distribution models, could negatively impact our results of operations, reflecting environmental perturbations and the requirement for strategic response and performance maintenance. We believe that we will be able to continue to meet our current and long-term liquidity and capital requirements, including fixed charges, through our cash flows from operating activities; existing cash, cash equivalents and investments; available borrowings under our existing credit facilities; and our ability to obtain future external financing, demonstrating financial resource generation and system resilience. We test for compliance with our leverage covenant on an ongoing basis, and as of December 31, 2017, we met this financial covenant by a significant margin, indicating operational flexibility and proactive financial management to sustain organizational health.

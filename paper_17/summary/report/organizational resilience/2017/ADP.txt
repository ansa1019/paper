We have implemented policies and procedures to monitor and address compliance with anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions, and anti-money laundering laws and continuously review, upgrade and enhance our compliance framework; we maintain a multifaceted information security program designed to prevent, detect and respond to evolving data security incidents but acknowledge that increasingly sophisticated malicious tactics may outpace our ability to anticipate or mitigate every threat. We have established disaster recovery, business continuity and crisis management plans and procedures to protect against natural disasters, military or terrorist actions, power or communication failures and similar events, although these plans may not fully prevent or mitigate loss of client data, service interruptions or operational disruptions. Our critical payroll, financial, accounting and other data processing systems are hosted in our own and third-party data centers, and any failure or disablement—even for a brief period—could result in financial loss, client liability, regulatory intervention or reputational harm. To remain competitive and sustain long-term growth in industries subject to rapid technological advances, shifting client needs and evolving regulations, we continually upgrade, enhance and expand our solutions, invest in product innovation, strategic platforms and our sales and service organizations, and adapt the manner in which we conduct aspects of our business as required by regulatory developments. Our strong business model—with a high percentage of recurring revenues, robust cash flows, solid balance sheet and low capital expenditure requirements—together with disciplined operational improvements, strategic investments and proactive risk-mitigation efforts, underpins our ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions and emerge stronger from disruptive events.

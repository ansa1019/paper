KKR’s Form 10-K discloses that its operations and those of its portfolio companies are materially affected by market and economic conditions outside the company’s control and that, while KKR attempts to mitigate known risks “to the extent we believe to be practicable and reasonable,” it makes no assurance that such mitigation will be successful.  The firm emphasizes maintaining liquidity and operational continuity through committed capital sources—such as credit facilities for underwriting, warehouse investments for private placements and margins, and disciplined capital calls to meet obligations—and through a fixed quarterly distribution policy.  KKR highlights its reliance on robust business-continuity and disaster-recovery programs, written “business continuity plans and transition plans” as contemplated by proposed SEC rules, secure processing, storage and transmission of critical information across its technology infrastructure and that of third-party service providers, and ongoing enhancements to these systems to accommodate growth and new products.  It notes that disruptions—whether from cyberattacks, system failures, natural disasters or other internal or external variations—could jeopardize confidential information, impair trading and settlement functions, and degrade its ability to serve clients.  KKR further discusses governance measures designed to preserve organizational health, including a carry pool allocation methodology to align incentives, structured tax receivable agreements, and key-person provisions to sustain leadership continuity.  Together, these practices reflect a systemic perspective on resource deployment, risk assessment and reconfiguration—aimed at preserving critical functions, enabling positive adjustment under both nominal and extreme conditions, and supporting performance maintenance amid internal or external perturbations.

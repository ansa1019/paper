The Company recognizes that failures, inadequacies or breaches of its information technology systems, networks and infrastructure could result in material harm to its business and reputation, and accordingly maintains the confidentiality, integrity and availability of its IT systems, implements measures to prevent, detect, respond to and minimize cyber-attack risks while acknowledging that these may not be successful. It addresses fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates through hedging programs, maintaining an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and the use of interest-rate and foreign-currency derivative contracts to limit volatility in earnings and cash flows. To sustain operations under competitive, regulatory and economic pressures, the Company depends on a continuous flow of successful new products to replace revenues lost to patent expirations or competitive entry, manages research and development spending across its portfolio so that delays or terminations of individual projects do not materially impact total spending, and maintains a returns policy and reserves for future product returns estimated from historical return rates, channel inventory levels and anticipated competitive and regulatory changes. The Company also establishes sales rebate and discount accruals based on historical experience and contractual and statutory requirements for managed care, Medicare and Medicaid; regularly reviews wholesaler inventory levels to mitigate stocking and destocking risks; secures critical raw and intermediate materials through noncancelable purchase obligations; and monitors customer credit risk, economic downturns and tax-law changes, including provisional installment payments under the 2017 Tax Act, to forecast and manage liquidity. It believes that operating cash flows, available bank credit facilities, commercial paper markets and repatriation of foreign earnings under the new tax regime will be sufficient to fund operating needs, capital expenditures, dividends and strategic business-development initiatives, and it periodically conducts impairment reviews of long-lived and intangible assets by comparing carrying values to fair values based on projected undiscounted cash flows and reconfigures cost structures, sites and asset bases in response to lower projected revenues or integration activities.

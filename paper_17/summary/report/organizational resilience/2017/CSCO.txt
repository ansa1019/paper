The report discloses that the company’s operating results “may fluctuate in future periods” and be “more pronounced” in “an uncertain global economic environment,” reflecting the need to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions; it emphasizes that “inventory management remains an area of focus” as the company balances the need to maintain strategic inventory levels for competitive lead times against the risk of “excess and obsolete inventories,” and it notes that “when facing component supply-related challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations,” including securing memory supply and entering commitments with contract manufacturers to mitigate risk. It describes the company’s ability to “realign and dedicate resources into key priority and growth areas” such as security, IoT, collaboration, next-generation data center, cloud and software, while “maintaining leadership in routing, switching and services,” and it outlines a restructuring plan expected to be substantially completed by the first quarter of fiscal 2018, under which cost savings will be reinvested in strategic initiatives to drive long-term profitable growth. The company acknowledges that “a reduction or interruption in supply,” component shortages, “actual events, circumstances, outcomes, and amounts differing from judgments, assumptions, and estimates,” as well as customers’ and suppliers’ “ability to obtain financing,” could adversely affect its business and that it employs hedging strategies to address “exposures to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates.” It highlights its reliance on “investments in engineering, sales, service, and marketing activities” and on product “innovation” and “value engineering efforts” to improve productivity, reduce production costs, and maintain competitive advantage. The report also discusses the importance of maintaining a “strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position” to fund acquisitions, customer financing activities, working capital needs, and capital return programs, including a commitment to return at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. It notes the need to continually assess “loss contingencies,” such as supplier component remediation and product warranties, and to monitor “the financial condition of our contract manufacturers and component suppliers” to preserve system integrity and ensure business continuity.

The company acknowledges that its reliance on sole-sourced outsourcing partners for component supply and final assembly “reduces the company’s direct control over production and distribution” and that “it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions.” It warns that “manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues,” any of which “could have a negative impact on the company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods.” The company further discloses that “system redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the company’s business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities” and that “in the event of a natural disaster, the company could incur significant losses, require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations,” noting that the majority of its critical R&D activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology systems and certain suppliers are located in areas susceptible to such events. It also recognizes that “unexpected developments late in a quarter, such as … an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the company’s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners” could materially affect its operating results, and that “losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information” could “materially adversely affect the company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results,” despite “significant resources” devoted to network and data security. Finally, the company cautions that abrupt shifts in demand or production forecasts could lead to “excess or insufficient amounts of components or products” and related write-downs, and that “no assurance can be given that the company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence” in its highly competitive and volatile markets.

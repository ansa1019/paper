Our business continuity and risk management framework includes backup systems and business continuity plans designed to protect critical information systems and maintain operational integrity, recognizing that failures of these systems or unauthorized intrusions could disrupt our supply chain, manufacturing and distribution capabilities, result in loss of revenue, assets or confidential data, incur litigation and regulatory action, and damage organizational reputation. We employ rigorous control and compliance procedures aimed at preventing and detecting unlawful conduct, though the breadth and scope of our international operations may limit detection of all improper or unlawful behavior, thereby posing additional operational interruptions. We acknowledge that economic, political and regulatory developments, natural disasters, conflicts or civil unrest could result in loss of property or equipment and difficulty in staffing and managing operations, thereby impairing volumes, revenues and net earnings. In identifying forward-looking strategies, we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions, using terminology such as “strategy,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates” and “projects,” and recognize that actual outcomes may vary materially should known or unknown risks, uncertainties or inaccurate assumptions materialize. Our strategic response capabilities encompass anticipating and responding to consumer trends by promoting brand equity, developing new products and markets, improving productivity, ensuring adequate production capacity, protecting margins through pricing adjustments and converting adult smokers to reduced-risk products via multidisciplinary research and scientific substantiation. We have reorganized our operating segments to focus on combustible and smoke-free products, pursue selective acquisitions and strategic business relationships to reconfigure resources, drive innovation and maintain competitive advantage, and continually assess the impacts of currency fluctuations, tax reforms and regulatory actions to sustain organizational health and resilience under external pressures. Furthermore, our financial planning process incorporates scenario analysis and forecasting of future performance metrics such as diluted earnings per share, net revenue growth, operating cash flow and capital expenditures, while accounting for currency exchange rates, effective tax rate changes and potential extraordinary items, thereby supporting an adaptive and future-oriented approach to maintaining performance under adverse conditions.

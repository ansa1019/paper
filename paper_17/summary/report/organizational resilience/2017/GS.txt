Goldman Sachs emphasizes the maintenance of business continuity and system integrity under adverse conditions through a comprehensive resilience framework that includes robust liquidity planning, capital planning and stress testing, contingency funding plans, and resolution and recovery plans designed to enable “positive adjustment under challenging conditions.”  The firm’s risk management infrastructure integrates enterprise-wide liquidity stress tests, capital scenario analyses and resolution capital models to ensure it can absorb strains such as sudden deposit withdrawals, collateral calls or counterparty defaults, preserve functioning during periods of market dislocation, and reconstitute funding, even when unsecured debt and capital markets are unavailable.  Extensive operational risk controls, model validation, independent price verification and ongoing backtesting of value-at-risk and stress models, together with global business resilience and technology risk committees, underpin organizational flexibility and adaptation strategies, while rigorous credit-risk mitigants, netting and collateral arrangements support continuity of derivative and financing activities.  The firm maintains gcla of unencumbered, high-quality liquid assets to meet estimated cash and collateral needs over a 30-day stress horizon, and detailed intraday liquidity models to address settlement disruptions, ensuring readiness for pandemics, extreme weather, cyber threats or other disruptive events.  Business continuity plans, capital and liquidity support agreements among parent, funding and major subsidiaries, and a triggers-and-alerts framework govern proactive measures and crisis response, facilitating synchronization of resources and strategic foresight to emerge stronger from adversity.

The report describes that “these risks are mitigated by our ability to maintain and improve business and data governance policies and processes and internal security controls, including our ability to escalate and respond to known and potential risks,” reflecting ongoing efforts to absorb strain and preserve functioning in the face of security threats. It states that “we use a range of disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements,” noting that “for many of our offerings, our production environment and customers’ data are replicated in near real-time in a separate facility located elsewhere” and that “certain offerings, including some offerings of companies added through acquisitions, may be served through alternate facilities or arrangements,” thereby preserving system integrity under adverse conditions. The filing acknowledges that “we do not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events,” and that “despite precautions taken at these facilities, such as disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism … could result in lengthy interruptions in our services,” underscoring both the potential for environmental perturbations and the measures taken to mitigate them. It further warns that “if we do not accurately plan for our infrastructure capacity requirements and we experience significant strains on our data center capacity, our customers could experience performance degradation or service outages that may subject us to financial liabilities, result in customer losses and harm our business,” highlighting forward-looking resource deployment and operational flexibility as resilience mechanisms. Finally, the report notes that “our internal IT systems continue to evolve and we are often early adopters of new technologies and new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers, which increases the complexity of our IT systems,” implying ongoing reconfiguration and adaptation to manage complexity and unexpected situations.

The Company’s annual report repeatedly underscores its pursuit of resilience through continuous adaptation of processes, systems and resources to maintain performance under external pressures and internal variations. It notes that “our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties,” including rapid shifts in technology, disruptive change and intense competition, and stresses the importance of innovation and resource allocation by “devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud‐based strategies” and “undertaking cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation.” The report highlights investments in data analytics—“the company’s investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to…the operational efficiency”—and in securing and expanding its datacenter and network infrastructure to uphold service continuity, noting that “maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex” yet critical to prevent “inefficiencies or operational failures” that could diminish product and service quality. In response to evolving cyber-attack threats and personal data risks, the Company affirms that it must “continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates…maintain the digital security infrastructure,” and provide mitigation technologies and customer security tools to absorb hazards and preserve integrity. It further recognizes that “a disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations,” reinforcing the premium placed on “the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans.” The Company also acknowledges that “developing new technologies is complex,” and that “acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic alliances involve significant challenges and risks,” requiring ongoing risk assessment, strategic response, operational flexibility and change management to reconfigure trajectories and sustain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

Management’s disclosures describe a range of external pressures and potential disruptions—uncertainty about global economic conditions, credit and sovereign debt concerns, volatile currency exchange rates and energy costs, disruptions in the financial credit markets, insolvency of key suppliers and resultant product delays, changes in trade, fiscal and tax policies, natural disasters, epidemic diseases, and cybersecurity threats—that require the company to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite adversity. They note that broad use of their products depends on internal knowledge and rapid training of surgical teams to ensure business continuity, that customers may postpone or reduce spending due to financial difficulties or regulatory uncertainty, and that reliance on sole-source suppliers and distributors poses risks that could harm their ability to meet demand. To mitigate risk and maintain operational flexibility, the company employs inventory management practices, foreign-currency hedging, self-insurance and third-party insurance coverage, extensive quality control and corrective and preventive actions under good manufacturing practice requirements, and periodic internal and third-party audits to ensure regulatory compliance and system integrity. They describe field actions—including product recalls, corrective actions, and additional training—to remedy safety or compliance issues and maintain continuity, and they emphasize contingency planning for import/export restrictions, potential regulatory changes, and legal proceedings. In addition, management highlights strategic initiatives—research and development investments, inter-organizational collaborations such as a joint venture to develop new catheter-based devices, licensing arrangements, joint ventures, acquisitions, and strategic alliances—to reconfigure resources, adapt to evolving healthcare and competitive landscapes, and sustain future growth. These measures together support positive adjustment under challenging conditions, enabling the company to respond effectively to environmental disruptions, recover from events, and maintain performance and competitive advantage.

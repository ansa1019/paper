Management acknowledges that both domestic and international operations face cyclical economic conditions that “may adversely affect our results of operations” and that “it may be difficult for us to adjust our business model to mitigate the impact of these factors.” The company warns that failure to “timely and appropriately respond to competitive pressures” or to comply with “evolving” security, environmental and trade regulations “may increase our operating costs or require significant capital expenditures” and could expose operations to security breaches or attacks “which could adversely affect our operations or our reputation.” In describing its preparedness for disasters, UPS recognizes that “severe weather or other natural or manmade disasters … may result in decreased revenues … or increased costs” and that any such event at a major facility “could result in a significant interruption in or disruption of our business.” To shore up its resilience, the company states “we have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiatives, information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans” and that “we continually adjust our air and ground networks to better match higher volume levels” while also “deploy[ing] and utiliz[ing] technology to increase package sorting and delivery productivity.” UPS further details its approach to risk mitigation by noting that “we mitigate our exposure to changing fuel prices through our indexed fuel surcharges and we may also enter into hedging transactions from time to time,” and that “we monitor and manage our exposures to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates, and make use of derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of changes in these rates.” Finally, the company concedes that “despite our best efforts, we are not fully insulated from data breaches and system disruptions,” and warns that forecasting uncertainties in projected volumes and capital investments may challenge its ability to maintain operational continuity and adapt to adverse conditions.

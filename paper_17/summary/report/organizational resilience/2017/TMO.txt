The Form 10-K discloses that the company must develop new products, adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to competitor introductions to remain competitive, warning that without timely product, service and enhancement launches its technologies will become obsolete and revenue and operating results would suffer, and acknowledging that difficulties in predicting customer needs may lead to heavy investment in research and development that does not yield significant revenue.  To improve internal growth the company is pursuing strategies such as strengthening geographic presence, allocating R&D funding to higher-growth prospects, developing new applications, expanding service offerings, combining sales and marketing operations, finding new markets and enhancing commercial tools and infrastructure to support cross-selling opportunities.  The company states its business is affected by general economic conditions and related uncertainties in key markets that could reduce demand, increase order cancellations or delays, lead to excess and obsolete inventories, pressure prices and lengthen sales cycles; it is exposed to currency exchange fluctuations that could adversely affect cash flows, reported revenues and profitability; and changes to trade agreements, regulations and government budgets could adversely affect operating results.  The company emphasizes risk mitigation through patent and trade secret protection, quality management systems and training to ensure compliance with health, safety and regulatory requirements, noting that failures in these systems could disrupt operations, lead to product recalls or seizures, and damage reputation.  Supply-chain resilience is highlighted by noting reliance on third-party package-delivery services where service disruptions or cost increases may impede timely deliveries, increase costs and harm customer relationships.  The risk of information technology system interruptions from natural disasters, security breaches or implementation problems is acknowledged, with potential impacts on service continuity, customer ordering and fulfillment, reputation and financial performance.  The company’s financial flexibility faces constraints from significant indebtedness and covenant-based restrictions that could limit its ability to obtain additional financing or execute strategic acquisitions, and default risks from economic or market disturbances are noted.  Competitive pressures from customers and suppliers that also compete with the company could disrupt supply or sales relationships, while the inability to protect intellectual property or failure of confidentiality agreements could result in litigation or loss of competitive advantage.  Operational resilience measures cited include restructuring actions and productivity improvements through global sourcing, facility consolidations, headcount optimization and practical process improvement systems to enhance cost efficiency.  The company’s strategy to augment internal capabilities with complementary acquisitions and significant strategic growth investments in commercial and e-commerce capabilities further reflects efforts to absorb strain, maintain or improve functioning under challenging conditions and adapt to external pressures to sustain performance.

We maintain an information security program with multiple layers of protection, routinely testing our systems to discover and remediate vulnerabilities arising from cyber-attacks, fraud, malware or geopolitical events, and we allocate substantial resources to modify or enhance protective measures as threats evolve. We sustain operational flexibility and system integrity through a business continuity program that analyzes risk, assesses potential impacts and develops effective response strategies to address technology malfunctions, fire, weather events, power outages, telecommunications disruptions, terrorism, workplace violence and other catastrophic events, while acknowledging that our insurance coverage may not fully immunize us from future losses. We mitigate settlement and liquidity risks by monitoring our customers’ financial condition, economic and political operating environments and compliance with participation standards, and we operate a comprehensive AML/CTF and OFAC-sanctions compliance framework comprising policies, procedures and internal controls to prevent illicit finance, money laundering and transactions with prohibited parties. In response to rapid technological developments in smart cards, contactless and mobile payments, e-commerce, cryptocurrency, blockchain, machine learning and AI, we continually diversify our integrated products and services and integrate new platforms—most notably through the acquisition and careful integration of Vocalink’s real-time account-based payment network—managing the associated regulatory oversight, operational complexity and security vulnerabilities in order to preserve performance under internal or external variations, recover swiftly from disruptions and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions. Further, we leverage third-party and acquired expertise, work with technology partners under strict data governance, proactively monitor political and economic conditions across more than 210 countries and deploy strategic initiatives in product diversification, customer collaboration and market development to sustain organizational functioning, competitive advantage and resilience.

Following a significant network cyber-attack in June 2017 that disrupted worldwide manufacturing, research and sales operations, the company reported that all of its manufacturing sites are now operational, continued to fulfill orders and ship product, recorded remediation expenses net of insurance recoveries and anticipates residual order backlogs to affect sales into 2018; it has implemented a variety of measures to harden its information systems, launched an enterprise-wide effort to enhance resiliency against future cyber-attacks—including hardening, recovery speed improvements and business-continuity planning—and continues to monitor its data, IT systems and personnel usage to reduce current and potential threats. Following Hurricane Maria’s impact on its Puerto Rico plant, the company employed alternative power and water sources, worked to restore infrastructure and resumed production activities to support operational continuity. In response to external pressures from patent expirations, generic and biosimilar competition and pricing constraints, the company defends its intellectual property through litigation to preserve market exclusivity, commits substantial effort, funds and resources to research and development both internally and with third-party collaborators, and pursues external alliances to supplement its pipeline; it focuses on a continuous flow of new product launches, new indications and brand extensions sufficient to cover substantial R&D costs and to replace sales lost due to competitive erosion. The company manages global economic and regulatory risks by closely monitoring pricing pressures, reimbursement policies and austerity measures, adjusting resource allocation and product mix, and leveraging its manufacturing network and contract relationships to maintain integrity of supply and firm performance under challenging conditions.

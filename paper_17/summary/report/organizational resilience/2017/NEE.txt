Throughout its risk disclosures and management’s discussion and analysis, the Company details its systemic framework for preserving performance under internal and external variations, including energy and financial hedging strategies to manage commodity price, interest rate, and foreign currency exposures; rapid restoration protocols following severe weather events—restoring 50 percent of customers within one day and 95 percent within seven days after Hurricane Irma—and the use of regulatory storm surcharges and reserve amortization under successive rate agreements to recover restoration costs and replenish reserves via tax savings; strategic investments in modernized generation and transmission assets, such as the Port Everglades clean energy center, and diversified gas infrastructure and renewable projects to bolster operational flexibility and resource allocation; robust liquidity and capital resource management through diversified credit facilities, capital market issuances, asset retirement obligation funding, and nuclear decommissioning trust investments to sustain business continuity and absorb financial strain; process controls for project siting, permitting, licensing, and construction to mitigate schedule and budgetary risks; advanced information technology and cybersecurity measures to safeguard critical systems and minimize operational disruption from cyber attacks; credit risk administration through master netting agreements, collateral requirements, and investment-grade credit rating maintenance to secure counterparty performance; and continuous oversight of regulatory assets and liabilities, environmental compliance programs, and contingency funding mechanisms to adapt to regulatory, political, market, and environmental perturbations, all of which underpin the Company’s ability to adjust positively under challenging conditions and reconfigure its operational trajectory in response to disruptive events.

Our ability to sustain profitability depends on our capacity to continue to increase revenue and control costs in order to, among other things, counter any unforeseen difficulties, complications or other unknown factors that may impair future revenue or require additional expenditures; we rely on a worldwide network of third-party manufacturers to support our supply chain for commercial use and clinical trials, acknowledging that supply disruptions outside our control could disrupt commercial supply and delay completion of clinical trials; we rely on third parties such as contract research organizations and clinical investigators for pre-clinical work and clinical trials, requiring operational flexibility to replace underperforming service providers; we have expanded and are continuing to expand our global operations and capabilities, placing significant demands on management and our operational, research and development and financial infrastructure, and in order to manage these demands effectively we must implement and clearly communicate corporate-wide strategies, enhance operational and financial infrastructure and processes, train and manage our global employee base, transition from a U.S.-centric company to one capable of developing and commercializing multiple drug candidates in international markets, and enhance our compliance and legal resources; we dedicate substantial management and other resources to obtain and maintain appropriate levels of reimbursement for our products, pursuing country-by-country pricing and reimbursement negotiations in ex-U.S. markets amid evolving governmental controls; we maintain a valuation allowance on the majority of our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets, reflecting prudent risk mitigation against uncertainty in future taxable income; we monitor inventory levels in the distribution channel and assess product returns, rebates and discounts to ensure revenue recognition reflects fixed or determinable prices; and we review our lease obligations and capitalized project costs to manage our long-term financial commitments.

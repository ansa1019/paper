Starbucks’ risk factor disclosures and management commentary, while not explicitly labeling it “organizational resilience,” describe a comprehensive framework of resources, processes and strategic behaviors that align with “the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.” The Company acknowledges operating “in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment” with “new factors” that cannot be fully predicted, and it has established “incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans” supported by “significant investments in technology, third party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and to prevent or minimize breaches,” even as it concedes these measures “cannot provide assurance” against all disruptions. Starbucks identifies a range of potential internal and external disturbances—from negative macroeconomic shifts and adverse health or safety incidents to supply-chain interruptions, privacy breaches, natural disasters and information technology failures—and details its deployment of resources to preserve or restore functioning, including training and support for licensees and suppliers, monitoring operations, reallocating capital to “additional security technologies, personnel, experts and credit monitoring services,” and leveraging digital and mobile platforms to mitigate risk and sustain performance. The Company’s strategic initiatives, such as expanding flexible store formats, scaling supply-chain infrastructure, pursuing licensee and joint-venture models internationally, acquiring the remaining interest in its East China joint venture to “enhance sustainability programs,” and committing to deliberate capital expenditures for new and existing stores and corporate facilities, further illustrate its adaptive response to environmental pressures, its focus on system integrity and performance maintenance during nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions, and its objective of emerging stronger from adversity.

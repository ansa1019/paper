The Annual Report repeatedly underscores the company’s structured efforts to sustain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, reflecting an implicit commitment to organizational resilience through comprehensive risk‐management and continuity planning.  Item 1A details our integrated risk management framework—anchored by board oversight, the PepsiCo Risk Committee and divisional risk committees—tasked with identifying, prioritizing and mitigating strategic, operational, financial and compliance risks, including natural disasters, cyberattacks, pandemics, supply‐chain disruptions and geopolitical instability.  We maintain a robust business continuity posture by monitoring global economic, political and social volatility, stress‐testing our supply of critical raw materials such as water and agricultural commodities against climate change and resource‐scarcity scenarios, and deploying disaster‐recovery and backup systems to ensure operational continuity of manufacturing, distribution and information‐technology assets.  Our global productivity initiatives and shared‐services model reflect a systemic perspective on resource allocation, cost‐reduction and operational flexibility, while strategic investments in forecasting, consumer‐insights and e-commerce capabilities illustrate future orientation and adaptability to rapid shifts in consumer preferences and retail landscapes.  We also address regulatory perturbations—from nutrition taxes and labeling mandates to environmental and trade regulations—through proactive compliance, legal‐risk assessment and stakeholder engagement, thereby reconfiguring processes, mitigating risks and preserving firm performance under external pressures.  Moreover, our multi‐year sustainability commitments—focused on reducing water usage, lowering greenhouse‐gas emissions and promoting responsible sourcing—serve as resilience strategies to manage environmental hazards and safeguard organizational health.  Across geographic and functional units, we leverage scenario planning, cross‐functional collaboration and financial hedging of commodities, currencies and interest rates to reconstitute trajectories, absorb shocks and maintain integrity of our global operations despite unexpected disruptions.

The Company must manage fluctuating demand for its services and network capacity to mitigate increased costs associated with resizing operations, higher unit operating costs and equipment storage, while ensuring business continuity when demand exceeds designed capacity or surges coincide with weather-related events; accordingly, it continues to improve its transportation plan, add capacity, enhance yard and facility operations, and deploy adequate resources to address service surges, although it acknowledges these measures may not fully prevent service shortcomings. Final implementation of positive train control will require adaptation and integration of its system with those of other railroads, illustrating inter-organizational collaboration in risk mitigation. To preserve operational integrity under adverse conditions, the Company employs a multi-faceted approach to safety—utilizing technology, risk assessment, training and employee engagement, quality control, and targeted capital investments—and will continue to align resources with customer demand, maintain network fluidity, and ensure asset surge capability. Fuel surcharge programs trail price fluctuations by approximately two months, reflecting dynamic pricing and resource allocation strategies. The 2018 capital plan, which allocates approximately 70% of expenditures to renewing and improving existing infrastructure and the balance to new capacity investments—initial construction of a classification yard, positive train control, locomotives, intermodal containers, chassis, and freight cars—is a critical component of its long-term strategic plan designed to replace and improve track infrastructure for safe, fluid operations, increase network efficiency, and seize growth opportunities. To support financial resilience, the Company maintains a $1.7 billion revolving credit facility as an emergency liquidity source, a receivables securitization facility, and access to commercial paper, bank loans and bond issuances, and monitors its capital structure—including adjusted debt to capital ratios—to balance cost-effective access to financing with overall cost of capital. Employment relations governed by collective bargaining agreements are managed through industry and local negotiations under the Railway Labor Act to sustain workforce flexibility and avoid operational disruptions, while reliance on technology improvements and contingency planning for cyber-attack risks underscore its adaptive capabilities. The Company also addresses environmental, personal injury, hazardous material and climate change risks through compliance, remediation programs and insurance arrangements, noting that severe weather and regulatory changes could cause significant network interruptions, increased operating costs or capital spending reductions. It maintains adequate resources and access to capital markets to meet foreseeable cash requirements, continually assesses asset replacement needs using inflation indices and depreciation studies, and employs actuarial analyses for pension and postretirement benefits to ensure the sufficiency of financial and human capital, thereby enabling the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging economic, regulatory and operational conditions.

Our businesses routinely encounter strategic, operational, legal, and financial risks that could materially affect our future results, and management emphasizes that the manner in which we respond to future developments—and competitors’ reactions—may affect our operating outcomes. We face intense competitive pressures and must adapt continually to technological changes and global trends, devoting significant resources to product development, service innovation, ongoing enhancements and the rollout of connected services across desktop subscriptions, which are recognized over multi-year periods. In order to preserve business continuity and maintain performance under internal or external disturbances, we have established internal review and approval processes for open source components, deployed extensive security and fraud-prevention measures, shared information with governmental agencies, and invested in high-availability capabilities, disaster recovery planning and the migration of critical applications to new data centers and third-party hosted environments, while acknowledging that these controls cannot provide absolute security and that our critical systems often lack full redundancy. We rely extensively on third-party partners—software licensors, hosting and cloud providers, financial institutions, distributors and platform owners—and recognize that any disruption, failure to meet quality standards, sole-source dependencies or adverse changes in partner terms may impair our ability to accept and fulfill customer orders, maintain service levels, or deliver new offerings, especially during critical peak periods such as the tax filing season, where interruptions could result in lost revenue, customer attrition and reputational harm. Our operations also depend on attracting, retaining and developing highly skilled personnel in a competitive labor market, and sustaining flexible resource allocation to reconfigure delivery models, reconstitute service delivery processes, support strategic initiatives, acquisitions and divestitures, and expand into new business models—including free-to-end-user offerings—so as to preserve organizational health, integrity and performance in the face of adversity, environmental turbulence and evolving stakeholder demands.

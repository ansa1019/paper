We maintain a comprehensive risk framework, approved annually by the board and executive management, that articulates our risk appetite and embeds proactive processes for identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks so that we can absorb strain and preserve or improve our functioning under challenging conditions.  Our contingency funding and capital plans and our recovery plan, which integrate enterprise-wide stress testing and scenario analysis, are designed to ensure that the parent company and key subsidiaries, including our banks and broker-dealers, hold sufficient cash and high-quality unencumbered securities to meet contractual and contingent obligations through periods of market stress, maintain access to diversified funding sources, and support business continuity.  We have established backup systems, safeguards and operational routines—including business continuity and incident-management procedures, disaster-response facilitation, and cyber-attack detection and remediation capabilities—to mitigate the impact of technology failures, natural disasters, pandemics, terrorism, fraud or other external shocks on our infrastructure, data processing and service delivery.  Our strategic planning and capital allocation process incorporates a systemic perspective on potential internal and external perturbations, requiring lines of business and independent risk management to evaluate the resiliency of major objectives, capital resources, liquidity and operational capabilities; to stress-test portfolios under extreme but plausible scenarios; and to support rapid reconfiguration of assets, liquidity and risk positions to maintain organizational coherence and operational flexibility in the face of evolving economic challenges.

The Annual Report states that “any of the factors below could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or stock price” and acknowledges that operations have experienced “volatility in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory and storage products which may adversely affect our business,” including periods when average selling prices have been below manufacturing costs. It highlights that “gross margins are dependent upon continuing decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes and product designs” and warns that if the company “is unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to maintain or improve gross margins,” it could suffer material adverse effects. The report describes strategic product diversification decisions, the ramp-up of new fabrication facilities, and joint ventures (such as with IMFT and Inotera) as means to reconfigure capacity, share technology, and absorb strain from competitive and market fluctuations. It outlines debt obligations that “require us to use a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest,” impose covenants that could be triggered under adverse conditions, and “increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and semiconductor memory and storage industry conditions,” and details risk-mitigation mechanisms including revolving credit facilities, hedging of foreign currency exposures, and structured capital expenditure plans (with estimated net cash expenditures of $7.5 billion in 2018). Supply chain resilience is addressed through multiple sourcing efforts for raw materials and advanced equipment, while acknowledging that shortages or disruptions from natural disasters, security breaches, or regulatory constraints could “materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.” The company also notes measures such as restructurings, workforce reductions, and compliance controls to preserve liquidity and maintain operational continuity under internal or external variations, consistent with the principle of absorbing shock and preserving performance in the presence of adversity.

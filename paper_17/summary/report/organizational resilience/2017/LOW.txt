Lowe’s has developed a risk management process using periodic surveys, external research, planning processes, risk mapping, analytics and other tools to identify and evaluate the operational, financial, environmental, reputational, strategic and other risks that could adversely affect its business, supported by a CFO-administered framework that includes developing risk mitigation controls and procedures for the material risks identified. The company acknowledges that there may be other unforeseen factors not currently perceived to be material that could cause results to differ materially from expectations and recognizes the need to adapt its business concept in a rapidly evolving retail environment to address changing shopping habits, demands and demographics and to realize the intended benefits of organizational change initiatives. Adapting its business concept, including omni-channel sales and marketing presence, requires the delivery of large, complex programs with integrated planning, initiative prioritization, program sequencing, and the ability to anticipate and meet customer expectations while counteracting new developments and technology investments by competitors. Lowe’s emphasizes the importance of robust customer-facing technology systems that appeal to customers, function as designed, and provide a consistent experience across channels, and notes the reliance on specialized training and capabilities of personnel at all levels to implement strategic initiatives, empower associates, and drive change. Cybersecurity resilience remains a priority amid constantly evolving cyber-attacks, human errors and system failures, with the company investing in information security yet acknowledging that breaches or catastrophic events could result in unauthorized data disclosure, business interruptions, reputational damage, customer attrition, increased remediation costs and potential liability. Compliance with dynamic data privacy, cybersecurity, payment card, trade and other laws and regulations imposes ongoing costs to continually evaluate and adapt policies and processes, and failures may lead to fines, sanctions, investigations or litigation. Lowe’s also highlights its dependence on third-party service providers for payment processing, fulfillment, installation services and other critical functions, warning that vendor failure or disruption could adversely affect operations until replacement occurs, and identifies supply chain complexity and international expansion as sources of exceptional operational and integration risk, subject to political, economic, natural and regulatory disruptions. The company further recognizes the necessity of hiring, training, managing and retaining a skilled and diverse workforce to deliver culturally competent and differentiated customer experiences and supports strategic transactions—such as the acquisitions of Rona and Maintenance Supply Headquarters—as opportunities to reconstitute and reconfigure its trajectories toward future growth, requiring effective integration of personnel, systems, internal controls and processes to maintain organizational integrity, performance and competitive advantage under challenging conditions. In its management’s discussion and analysis, Lowe’s outlines targeted investments in analytics, marketing, expanded fulfillment options including a new direct fulfillment center, in-store pick up enhancements, supply chain transformation, associate empowerment through training and process re-engineering, compelling product experiences, and differentiated service offerings for DIY, DIFM and Pro customers, all designed to build agility, reinforce system resilience and maintain performance under pressure in turbulent markets.

The company cautions that its business is subject not only to market and economic fluctuations but also to geopolitical events, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected business conditions, including “supply interruptions, which could disrupt our ability to produce our products.” It acknowledges that its operations, products and services may be “damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, ransomware, human error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events,” and that in any such circumstances “our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate.” The company further recognizes its dependence on third‐party suppliers, the risk posed by consolidation of distributors and customer destocking, and the difficulty of forecasting sales volumes and order timing, all of which may impair operational continuity and flexibility. It underscores the importance of retaining longstanding customer relationships, developing innovative products and services, and maintaining reliable information technology systems and global data privacy and security controls to mitigate interruptions that could “delay production and shipments, result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets, damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties.” The company also notes that compliance with extensive environmental, health and safety regulations, as well as import/export and government contract requirements, is critical to avoiding “civil and criminal, monetary and nonmonetary penalties” that could adversely affect business continuity. Finally, it warns that catastrophic loss or breaches across its facilities, supply chains, distribution systems and information technology systems—due to fire, flood, earthquake, hurricane, public health crisis, war, terrorism or other natural or man‐made disasters—could seriously harm operations, delay shipments, cause product recalls and field actions, and inflict reputational damage that may not be fully covered by insurance.

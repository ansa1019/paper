Product-liability and patent-litigation exposures are managed through the establishment of accruals for probable losses and retention of legal expertise, evidencing crisis management and recovery mechanisms. Strategic relationships, including joint ventures and licensing agreements, are structured, consolidated or unwound in response to evolving market conditions, generic competition and patent challenges, demonstrating organizational adaptability and inter-organizational collaboration.

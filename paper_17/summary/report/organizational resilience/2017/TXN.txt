The Company’s disclosures describe a resilient operational model characterized by rapid response to competitive and technological pressures, strategic resource allocation and continuity planning to preserve performance under adversity. Management “responds rapidly to product development and pricing pressures,” invests in manufacturing technologies and maintains in-house production “to ensure a consistent supply of products for customers” and to support differentiated technology, and sustains liquidity through cash flow from operations supplemented by cash, short-term investments and a multi-year revolving credit facility to fund working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and debt repayments. The Company acknowledges exposure to macroeconomic downturns, natural disasters and global political, social and economic conditions that can disrupt transportation, communications, supply chains, information technology networks and manufacturing operations, as well as frequent and evolving cybersecurity threats that could compromise networks, corrupt data, interrupt operations or require remediation costs. It recognizes that “inventory and production” must be matched to customer forecasts to avoid inadequate, excess or obsolete inventory, and that reliance on third-party suppliers for goods, services, critical raw materials and advanced process technologies involves risks of quality excursions, capacity shortages, liquidity constraints and political or environmental disruptions. The Company also notes that fixed manufacturing costs, regulatory compliance burdens and competitive pricing pressures can affect profit margins when demand fluctuates. To mitigate these pressures, it makes significant investments in research and development to innovate and develop new products, maintains a broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products with long product life cycles, and undertakes business and organizational changes—including acquisitions, divestitures and restructuring—to support its strategic objectives, all of which reflect a multifaceted approach to preserving or improving its functioning despite internal or external disturbances.

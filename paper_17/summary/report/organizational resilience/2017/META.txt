In discussing our risk management and strategic investments, we note that we may periodically adjust the distribution of our products and business operations based on what we believe to be in our long-term best interests, including continued investments in security, video content, long-term technology initiatives, scaling of headcount, and expansion of data center capacity and office facilities to support growth. Our business continuity and performance under stress are dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure, which may require effective relationships with third-party providers and the successful mitigation of potential interruptions, delays, or failures resulting from natural disasters, power loss, cybersecurity threats, or other catastrophic events, and on our capacity to recover technical infrastructure and user data in a timely manner. We recognize that our products and internal systems rely on complex software, with vulnerabilities that may adversely affect service delivery, and we have developed systems and processes to protect data, prevent data loss, disable undesirable accounts, and remediate cyber-attacks, although absolute security cannot be assured. The integration of acquisitions and open-source contributions presents further challenges to organizational agility and resource reconfiguration, requiring significant allocations of time and resources and exposing us to potential litigation and intellectual property risk. Collectively, these efforts reflect our ongoing commitment to preserve performance and integrity under varying conditions and external pressures, thereby underpinning our capacity for positive adjustment and resilience in the face of adversity.

The Company’s disclosures describe its reliance on business continuity and disaster recovery measures to maintain operations under challenging conditions, emphasizing that its ability to operate during and recover from local or regional disasters, security breaches, cyber-attacks, power losses, telecommunications failures, pandemics, terrorist incidents or other continuity events depends on the continued availability of personnel, office facilities and fully functioning computer, telecommunications and related systems, as well as the security of its technology infrastructure and that of its third-party vendors. It recognizes that interruptions—whether caused by advanced persistent cyber threats, malware, ransomware or insider actions—could result in significant financial loss, reputational harm, diverted management resources, regulatory actions or loss of clients and revenues, and accordingly notes that extended outages may require substantial expense to remediate and could materially disrupt services to clients. The Company further discloses systematic risk-mitigation processes, including quarterly case-level reviews by inside and outside counsel and actuarial analyses to estimate potential losses from errors and omissions claims and adjust liabilities as warranted, underscoring its approach to absorb strain and preserve functioning amid legal, regulatory and competitive pressures. In addition, it highlights the operational risk arising from its dependence on numerous vendors and other third parties for critical functions—ranging from technology and data security to fund transfers and administrative services—indicating that failures or non-compliance by these parties could adversely impact its ability to recover from disruptive events, thereby reinforcing the importance of robust contingency planning, inter-organizational collaboration and resource allocation to sustain system integrity and performance maintenance under both nominal and exceptional conditions.

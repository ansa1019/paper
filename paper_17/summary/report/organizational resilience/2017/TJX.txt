Our annual report describes a range of processes, capabilities and investments designed to enable maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.  Our off-price business model relies on opportunistic buying, lean inventory levels and frequent inventory turns, placing discretionary authority in our merchants to react to changing opportunities and trends, assess merchandise value, reallocate floor space and deliver the right merchandise in the right mix at the right time, thereby supporting rapid adaptation and resource reconfiguration in response to customer demand and market volatility.  We maintain a forecasting process to plan sales and align expenses, routinely modify, update and replace information systems and infrastructure, and enter into fuel and currency hedges to mitigate risks, while acknowledging that power outages, system failures, cyberattacks, data security compromises or interruptions in outsourced operations could disrupt business continuity.  Our approach to disaster recovery and business continuity planning is continually enhanced to address natural disasters, pandemics, geopolitical instability and supply chain interruptions that could severely damage or destroy stores, distribution centers or data centers, limit transportation or require temporary closures.  We rely on strong cash flows, short-term investments, credit facilities and disciplined capital allocation to preserve liquidity for growth, share repurchases and dividends, recognizing that shifts in economic conditions, labor costs, tax legislation or financing availability could adversely affect our ability to deploy resources.  Our global expansion and the autonomy afforded to banners across multiple geographies increases complexity in managing systems, controls and shared information, requiring ongoing investments in administrative, systems, merchandising, logistics and compliance functions to preserve system integrity and organizational health.  Through continuous investments in strategic initiatives, risk assessment, internal training, supply chain capabilities and technology, we seek to absorb internal and external variations, preserve or improve functioning under both nominal and extreme conditions, and sustain competitive advantage and firm performance in turbulent markets.

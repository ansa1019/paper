The company’s operations involve storage, transmission and processing of customers’ confidential data and while security measures are in place, breaches—whether by external actors, employee error or evolving malware and hacking techniques—could undermine those measures and necessitate significant further investments to protect data and infrastructure, with any resulting security breach or unauthorized access potentially causing service disruptions, litigation, indemnification obligations, regulatory investigations and fines, reputational damage, loss of customers, mitigation and remediation expenses and other liabilities for which the company lacks sufficient insurance. The company acknowledges that delays in product releases or defects in new or updated offerings may slow customer adoption, reduce service delivery efficiency, decrease customer satisfaction, heighten vulnerability to cyber attacks and harm growth prospects. It relies on its network of implementation partners to deliver professional services, and customer implementations may be delayed, inefficient or unsuccessful due to integration, migration or security requirements or errors by the company or its partners, potentially resulting in significant implementation costs, claims, reputational harm and lost renewal opportunities. Its service delivery infrastructure is co-located in third-party data centers globally that remain vulnerable to earthquakes, floods, fires, power outages, sabotage, operator error and denial-of-service attacks, and despite crisis management and disaster response plans, problems at these facilities could lead to prolonged interruptions, data loss, significant recovery time and material expense, adversely affecting business continuity and financial condition. Moreover, natural disasters, pandemics, terrorism or political unrest could disrupt the company’s ability to deliver services, depress demand and increase operating costs. The company recognizes that sudden global financial developments, geopolitical instability, market volatility, restricted credit and economic uncertainty can quickly curtail information technology spending, delay purchasing decisions, reduce contract values or durations and impair renewal rates, all of which could weaken cash flows and operating results. Finally, the company emphasizes the need to accurately predict, prepare for and respond promptly to rapidly evolving technological and market developments—including cloud, mobile, collaboration, machine learning, security and other digital technologies—to maintain a competitive position, successfully deliver and integrate new platform offerings, anticipate customer needs, profitably market and sell products, and effectively deliver services through its ecosystem of partners, thereby preserving operational flexibility, risk mitigation capabilities and overall organizational resilience under varying internal and external pressures.

The risk disclosures describe a broad set of operational, financial and strategic challenges that bear on the company’s ability to maintain continuity and positive adjustment under adverse conditions.  They warn that “if any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed,” noting that the company “must continually add new memberships both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business” and that “if we do not grow as expected … we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our (per membership) revenues … such that our margins, liquidity and results of operation may be adversely impacted.”  They highlight competitive pressures—“the market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change” from traditional and internet-based providers, including piracy—and the need to “successfully compete with current and new competitors” or face adverse effects on market share, revenues and profitability.  They underscore risks arising from “the long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments,” including multi-year licensing and production obligations, which “may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our liquidity,” particularly if members do not meet expectations.  Investments in original programming are described as “responsible for production costs and other expenses, such as ongoing guild payments,” and “completion and key talent risk,” and the company may “remove content … if we believe such content might not be well received … or could be damaging to our brand.”  The disclosures emphasize operational complexity—“scaling our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in both members and features,” building technology and third-party cloud computing capacity, refining systems and operational practices, and developing expertise across creative, marketing, legal, finance, licensing, merchandising and content delivery—and warn that failures in these areas could “adversely affect our business.”  They identify cybersecurity and technology risks—“any significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems … could result in a loss or degradation of service,” that “efforts to prevent hackers … may limit the functionality of … our service,” and that an interruption in key third-party services such as Amazon Web Services “would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted.”  Regulatory and network-access risks are also noted—“changes in laws or regulations … could decrease the demand for our service and increase our cost of doing business,” potential discriminatory practices by network operators, and “censorship requirements” or content withdrawals in international jurisdictions.  Data privacy considerations—including reliance on encryption and authentication technology, potential legal claims or fines, and “increased regulation of data utilization practices”—are cited as factors that “could have an adverse effect on our business.”  Financially, the company acknowledges “a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations,” which “may limit our ability to use our cash flow … for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes,” increase vulnerability to adverse conditions, and, if cash flows are insufficient, could force the company to “reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell material assets or operations to meet our debt and other obligations.”  Other operational risks include payment processing disruptions, intellectual property protection challenges, the loss of key personnel or inability to hire qualified employees, and the continuing decline of its DVD-by-mail segment without meaningful reinvestment in that operation.  Collectively, these disclosures describe the resource allocation, risk-mitigation, adaptation and continuity challenges the company faces in preserving or improving its functioning despite competitive, technological, regulatory, financial and cyber-security adversities.

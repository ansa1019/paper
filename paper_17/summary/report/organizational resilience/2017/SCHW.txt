The report describes a comprehensive enterprise risk management framework and governance structure—led by a global risk committee and overseen by the board’s risk committee—to identify, assess, measure, monitor and mitigate risks across the firm, thereby enabling the organization to absorb strain and preserve integrity under challenging conditions. It explains the maintenance of systems, procedures and controls for business continuity, disaster recovery and operational resilience, including a geographically dispersed backup and recovery infrastructure, routine testing of continuity plans, information security measures integrating tools, technologies and advanced monitoring, employee training in privacy and security, and contractual, performance-monitoring and testing requirements for third-party service providers. It details model risk governance, compliance risk programs governing conduct, legal and regulatory compliance, fiduciary duties and privacy, and credit risk policies with collateral requirements, underwriting standards and allowances for loan losses, all designed to preserve functioning and firm performance under internal and external perturbations. It also outlines liquidity and capital risk management through regular stress testing under business-as-usual and stressed scenarios, early-warning indicators, contingency funding and capital plans, diversified funding sources including committed credit lines and commercial paper programs, and the maintenance of capital and liquidity buffers to ensure ongoing operational flexibility and the ability to respond to disruptive events, thereby supporting the maintenance of positive adjustment under extreme or unexpected conditions.

We depend on our principal offices in New York City for the continued operation of our business and acknowledge that a disaster or a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses, including electronic communications or other services used by us or third parties with whom we conduct business, could have a material adverse impact on our ability to continue to operate our business without interruption; our business continuation or disaster recovery programs may not be sufficient to mitigate the harm that may result from such a disaster or disruption, and insurance and other safeguards might only partially reimburse us for our losses, if at all.  Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks, and although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, theft, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, our fund investors’ or counterparties’ operations.  We maintain a global risk and conflicts committee and a portfolio management framework that subjects all prospective investments to a thorough due diligence process—including analysis of commercial, financial, legal, regulatory and environmental risks—and that requires approval of each investment by an investment committee and ongoing monitoring by senior professionals.  To preserve operational flexibility and maintain performance under varying market conditions, we employ hedging techniques, collateralized financing vehicles such as collateralized loan obligations and diversified product offerings across private equity, real assets, credit and hedge funds with differing fee bases, each with the objective of managing liquidity, absorbing adverse shifts in market parameters, reallocating resources and recovering swiftly from major disruptions.  While we attempt to mitigate known risks to the extent we believe to be practicable and reasonable, we make no representation that our mitigation efforts will be successful, and unanticipated market turbulence, regulatory changes, technology failures, security breaches or credit dislocations could strain our capacity to sustain liquidity, impede the realization of investments, impair stakeholder engagement or otherwise weaken our organizational health.

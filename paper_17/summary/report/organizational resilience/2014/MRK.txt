Merck’s Form 10-K discloses that it faces a wide range of internal and external disruptions—from global economic austerity, evolving regulations, loss of patent exclusivity, generic and biosimilar competition, product quality and supply chain interruptions (“manufacturing shutdowns, product shortages and delays in product manufacturing”), to geopolitical, environmental and technological risks (“war, terrorism, natural or man-made disasters,” “a significant breakdown, invasion, corruption, destruction or interruption of critical information technology systems,” “social media platforms present risks and challenges”). To maintain positive adjustment under these challenging conditions, management has implemented resilience strategies that include risk mitigation through dynamic resource allocation—committing substantial resources to research and development and pipeline innovation, forming strategic alliances and acquisitions, hedging currency and interest-rate exposures via revenue, balance-sheet and net-investment hedges, self-insuring major product liabilities, and maintaining liquidity with commercial paper and standby credit facilities—and organizational change processes including multi-year restructuring programs to sharpen commercial and R&D focus, redesign its operating model, reduce costs and enhance operational flexibility and business continuity. The company monitors credit and economic conditions in key markets, continuously assesses and adjusts its manufacturing and supply networks, organizational structure and financial risk management practices to preserve system integrity, sustain performance and emerge stronger from adversity.

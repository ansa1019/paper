The report discloses that the company’s global operations and structure expose it to a range of social, political, economic and environmental risks that could adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and ability to make distributions, and that failure to successfully manage such risks or to adequately manage operational fluctuations could harm its business; it emphasizes the ongoing commitment of “substantial resources to expand our global platform” while establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate new offices and monitor compliance with multiple, potentially conflicting laws, reflecting a systemic perspective on risk mitigation and operational flexibility; it describes efforts to preserve continuity under currency volatility—including borrowing in functional currencies, using derivative contracts to hedge exchange‐rate exposure and annually evaluating coverage—for the purpose of absorbing strain and maintaining performance under adverse conditions; it details the maintenance of earthquake, hurricane and flood hazard insurance subject to industry‐praised coverage limits and deductibles, annual reviews by outside consultants and the election to self‐insure when commercially prudent, thereby preserving integrity of assets and future revenues in the event of natural disasters; it outlines strategic responses to liquidity constraints—such as divesting properties, incurring debt, renegotiating leases and maintaining borrowing capacity under $2.7 billion of credit facilities—to adapt to unexpected shortfalls and sustain business continuity; it highlights geographic diversification of its industrial distribution portfolio to reduce exposure to localized economic downturns; it describes proactive management of debt—through issuances of debt denominated in multiple currencies, repurchases and early extinguishment to lower borrowing costs, extend maturities and preserve operational resources—and the monitoring of covenants to safeguard financial stability; it notes periodic impairment assessments and the exercise of discretion to change intent on long-held assets, recognizing impairments when recovery is unlikely, thereby reconfiguring resource allocation to support core operations; it references the implementation of redundancy, security measures and a disaster recovery plan to protect against system failures or cyber‐security attacks, demonstrating preparedness and crisis management; it acknowledges reliance on key personnel and the need to attract and retain talent to maintain organizational health and execution capacity; it identifies potential exposures to climate change—both physical risks from severe weather events and possible future regulatory risks related to energy efficiency—that may require enhanced preparedness and adaptation strategies in supply chain and building standards; and it underlines the use of co‐investment ventures and strategic capital initiatives to access additional financial resources, share risks and strengthen competitive advantage, all of which collectively reflect the company’s multifaceted approach to preserving or improving functioning under challenging conditions and emerging stronger from disruptive events.

The report acknowledges that forward‐looking statements involve “certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict,” including employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events, regulatory changes and international operations, and warns that “additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price.” It emphasizes that “obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval has been and will continue to be increasingly difficult, time‐consuming and costly,” that regulatory authorities may require additional testing, question chosen endpoints or mandate outcomes studies, and that failure to comply or meet conditional approvals could lead to withdrawals of products or restrictive labeling. To mitigate such risks, the company “is required to continuously collect and assess adverse events reported to us and to communicate to regulatory agencies,” and undergoes “periodic inspections of our pharmacovigilance processes.” It further describes reliance on “independent third‐party clinical investigators” and contract manufacturers for uninterrupted clinical trials and product supply, which may be impacted by natural disasters, equipment failures, capacity constraints, labor disputes, contamination, supply shortages or compliance issues, any of which could result in “delayed shipments, supply constraints, stock-outs and/or recalls.” The company concedes that changes in health-care reimbursement, pricing pressures and evolving guidelines can “negatively impact the ability or willingness of healthcare providers to prescribe our products,” and notes that global economic conditions, credit and capital market volatility may impair “the timing of collections of our trade receivables” or access to financing. In response, it maintains a diversified investment portfolio “while maintaining safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk,” employs interest rate and cross-currency swap contracts to hedge its debt mix, and retains a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility as a liquidity backstop. A corporate compliance program governs “development, manufacturing, distribution, pricing, sales, marketing and reimbursement,” while significant investments in cybersecurity seek to safeguard complex information systems against service interruptions or malicious intrusions. Finally, a restructuring plan announced in 2014 targets a 23 percent reduction in facilities footprint and workforce realignment to “invest in continuing innovation and the launch of our new pipeline molecules while improving our cost structure,” thereby reallocating resources and enhancing operational flexibility to preserve performance under challenging conditions.

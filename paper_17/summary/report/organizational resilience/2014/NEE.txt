The company describes its ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning under internal or external variations and disturbances—whether nominal, extreme or exceptional—as central to its operations, highlighting that business continuity and operational flexibility may be challenged by severe weather, natural disasters, equipment failures, cyber attacks, terrorism or other disruptive events that can cause prolonged outages, lost revenues, increased expenses and the need for restoration of service, facility repairs, procurement of replacement power and access to financing to reestablish normal operations. It discloses extensive regulation of its businesses that requires ongoing risk assessment, strategic response and resource allocation to adapt to legislative or regulatory changes—including cost recovery clauses, permitting requirements and rate proceedings—while emphasizing that any inability to recover costs or to comply adequately may have a material adverse effect on competitive advantage and organizational health. In its energy marketing and trading activities, the firm employs hedging procedures, derivative instruments and risk management tools such as value-at-risk models, stop-loss limits, liquidity guidelines and master netting agreements to mitigate commodity price volatility and counterparty credit risk, yet acknowledges these mechanisms may not protect fully against significant market shifts. The company further relies on insurance coverage, liquidity facilities, inter-organizational collaboration and workforce expertise to manage financial and operational risks, while noting that limitations in coverage, capital constraints, supply chain interruptions or the loss of key personnel could impede its capacity to recover or reconfigure resources following adverse events. Additionally, it funds and accrues for long-lived asset retirements—such as nuclear decommissioning and fossil plant dismantlement—over the expected service life of facilities based on periodic studies and escalation assumptions, thereby maintaining system integrity and performance maintenance through proactive planning and regulatory-approved recovery strategies.

Although we cannot predict or identify all potential risks or uncertainties, our operations face numerous challenges that test our resilience and business continuity, including substantial variability in product demand and wholesaler inventory draw-downs that can lead to mismatches between prescription demand and revenues, pricing pressure driven by cost-containment measures, payer negotiations and competition that require significant discounts, deferred reimbursements and rebate obligations, and the consequences of public health reforms and the branded prescription drug fee. Our manufacturing and supply chain, dependent on a limited number of facilities, third-party manufacturers and single-source suppliers, are subject to stringent GMP regulations and inspections, where deficiencies can suspend production and delay product shipments. We rely on complex information technology systems vulnerable to service interruption, cyberattacks and data security breaches, on credit-risky customers in southern Europe and emerging markets, and on collaborative partnershipsâ€”each of which may be disrupted, necessitating reconfiguration of resources and adaptive risk mitigation. Further, we confront natural or man-made disasters, such as major earthquakes in seismically active regions for which we carry no earthquake insurance, and must maintain emergency management plans to resume operations post-disaster. Regulatory compliance and pharmacovigilance requirements, intellectual property litigation, tax audits and potential compulsory licenses in developing countries also impose significant operational and financial demands. These circumstances require dynamic capabilities to allocate resources, adapt processes, uphold system integrity, maintain performance under pressure and ensure organizational survival and continuity under adverse and unpredictable conditions.

We have substantial exposure to losses resulting from natural and man-made catastrophes, including terrorism, cyber-attack, and pandemics, and attempt to manage this exposure through underwriting controls, risk models, targeted reinsurance layers, program size limits, and geographic diversification.  Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential information and assets, and our business depends on effective information security and systems and the integrity and timeliness of data; accordingly, we implement new security measures and continuously upgrade administrative and technical controls and contingency plans, which despite our efforts may be insufficient to prevent unauthorized access, malware, catastrophic events, system failures, cyber-attacks, or infrastructure disruptions.  We employ various modeling techniques and data analytics to analyze and estimate exposures, loss trends, and other risks associated with our assets and liabilities, supplement these outputs with expert judgment in setting loss reserves via standard actuarial methods and qualitative input, and regularly re-evaluate our actuarial development patterns and benefit ratio assumptions, recognizing that actual results may differ materially from model projections.  Our risk management framework further includes collateral arrangements, credit assessments and letters of credit to mitigate credit and counterparty risks.  Our investment guidelines stress diversification of risks, principal conservation, and liquidity, focusing on high-quality, investment-grade, short-duration fixed income securities to reduce interest-rate sensitivity, although market volatility may force us to liquidate securities at unfavorable prices.  Finally, our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning under challenging conditions depends on maintaining a disciplined underwriting process, a diversified capital base, access to credit facilities, and on attracting, retaining, and deploying qualified personnel whose skills are essential to our operational flexibility and sustained performance under adverse conditions.

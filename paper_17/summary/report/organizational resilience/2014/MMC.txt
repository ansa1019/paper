The company discloses that its risk and insurance services segment encompasses risk management activities (risk advice, risk transfer and risk control and mitigation solutions) as well as insurance and reinsurance broking and services, and that it utilizes case-level reviews by inside and outside counsel, an internal actuarial analysis and other analysis to estimate potential losses, establishing liabilities when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable and reviewing and adjusting those liabilities quarterly as developments warrant. It acknowledges that errors and omissions and similar claims, regulatory investigations and changes in legislation or regulation may materially adversely affect its business, results of operations or financial condition. The company’s ability to continue to operate under adverse conditions depends in part on the availability of its personnel, office facilities and the proper functioning of its computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations in the event of disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, pandemics, security breaches, cyberattacks, power losses, telecommunications failures or other natural or man-made events. It regularly assesses and takes steps to improve its existing business continuity plans and key management succession, but it warns that a disaster on a significant scale or affecting key operating areas, or its inability to successfully recover following a business continuity problem, could materially interrupt operations and result in material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships or legal liability. In the area of data security, the company engages in periodic testing and maintains policies, procedures and technical safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of confidential, personal and proprietary information, yet acknowledges those efforts may not discover all system deficiencies or prevent improper access, disclosure or misuse, whether due to human error, vendor data protection breakdowns or cyberattacks. It further recognizes that the age of some technology, the expansion of mobile, cloud-based and social media tools and the involvement of third-party vendors increase the risk of data incidents, and that failure to efficiently maintain and upgrade safeguards—particularly in connection with the integration of acquisitions—could increase system vulnerability, disrupt service delivery and expose the company to regulatory scrutiny, legal liability or reputational harm. The company also highlights that its global operations are subject to extensive and evolving laws, rules and regulations relating to data privacy, cyber security, trade sanctions, anti-corruption and other requirements that impose significant operational and compliance costs, and that differing interpretations or conflicts among jurisdictions may require substantial increases in costs or limit its ability to operate. To support its resilience under varying market conditions, the company maintains multi-currency revolving credit facilities and term loans subject to coverage and leverage covenants, diverse insurance coverage with varying policy limits and terms, and regularly evaluates its liquidity, including cash repatriation policies and dividend and intercompany financing arrangements, to ensure it can meet debt, regulatory and operational obligations despite external pressures or economic disruptions.

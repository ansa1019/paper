The company acknowledges that business interruption or failure of its information technology and communication systems may impair the availability of products and services and harm financial results, that it does not have redundancy for all systems and that its disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities, that in the event of significant system disruption it may experience loss of data or processing capabilities causing customer loss, that difficulties in upgrading applications or failure of systems of third-party providers may result in service interruptions, lost customers, negative publicity and increased operating costs, and that prolonged interruptions may significantly harm its business, financial condition and results of operations. It is migrating applications and infrastructure to new data centers and third-party hosted environments and warns that failure to execute the transition effectively may lead to unplanned service disruptions or unforeseen cost increases, harming operating results. Its operations, data centers and critical systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, human error, malicious attacks, fire, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, denial of service and terrorism, with key facilities near major seismic faults and no earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses, any of which may materially harm future financial results. The company relies on its own and external systems to take and fulfill customer orders and host online activities and notes that any interruption may prevent it from fulfilling orders or cause unintended disclosure of company or customer data. Its ongoing efforts to upgrade network security, information systems and high-availability capabilities may be costly, and problems in the design or implementation of enhancements could harm operations. The registrant hosts, collects, uses and retains sensitive personal information and data and warns that a security breach resulting in third-party access could materially disrupt its business, damage its reputation, reduce customer demand, trigger further regulation and oversight, and cause material losses. It detects vulnerabilities in servers and software components that, even if not exploited, may harm customer confidence and require substantial resources to remediate. Its technologies, systems and networks are subject to cyber attacks, viruses, worms, phishing and malicious software that could result in unauthorized release, loss or destruction of sensitive data or business disruption; inability to detect or contain intrusions promptly may compromise sensitive information. The company conducts background checks of employees, contractors and other individuals and limits access to systems and data, but acknowledges the possibility of controls circumvention, and relies on third-party hosting vendors whose security measures it may not fully monitor, any of which could result in loss of sensitive customer or employee information. Its growth depends on the strength of critical third-party relationships, and failure of third parties to provide acceptable products, services and technologies may disrupt operations, reduce revenues, cause customer loss and damage reputation; sole–source or limited–source relationships may be difficult to replace, and alternative arrangements may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, risking interruptions upon transition. In particular, it relies on banks, credit unions and other financial institutions to support critical services and notes that macroeconomic conditions could cause institutions to fail, consolidate or cease services, harming its business and financial results. The company has begun utilizing distribution platforms such as Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store and cautions that adverse changes by platform owners could adversely affect financial results. It acknowledges that increased government regulation and heightened regulatory scrutiny may impose limitations, require business changes, restrict its use of personal information or cause product and service modifications that could harm its future financial results; compliance requirements and costs may increase as it expands into more highly regulated segments and foreign jurisdictions, and it may be unable to respond quickly to regulatory developments, thereby limiting revenue opportunities and necessitating changes in business practices. The heightened regulatory attention on the tax preparation industry may restrict its product and service offerings, pricing or operations, and it notes that it may not be able to respond quickly, increasing its cost of doing business. It must comply with various state revenue agency standards and warns that changes in state-imposed requirements, including required use of specific technologies or standards, may significantly increase the costs of providing services and prevent timely delivery of quality products. The registrant further states that if it fails to process transactions effectively or to protect against fraudulent activities, its revenue and earnings may be harmed; effective processing systems and controls are essential, and inability to manage systems and processes may impair its ability to process customer data accurately, reliably and timely, which may harm its business. In its payments processing service business it may be required to pay customer refunds in excess of customer reserves if merchants cannot cover disputed or fraudulent transactions. The online tax preparation, payroll administration and online payments industries are experiencing increasing fraudulent activities, which may adversely impact the company’s operations, and a loss of confidence in its controls may seriously harm its business and brand. As industry fraud detection and prevention improve, the company may implement risk control mechanisms that could make it more difficult for legitimate customers to obtain and use its products, potentially resulting in lost revenue. Third parties claiming that the company infringes proprietary rights may force it to incur significant legal expenses, divert management attention, require it to stop selling, delay shipping or redesign products, or require payment of monetary damages, royalties or licensing fees and fulfillment of indemnification obligations. The registrant relies on third-party intellectual property under license agreements that may need renewal or renegotiation and acknowledges that inability to obtain necessary rights could prevent it from selling affected offerings, harm its future financial results, damage its brand and lead to customer loss; it also warns that open source software licenses may impose requirements on derivative works, and despite internal review processes, such risks may remain and harm the business. The company states that its patents, trademarks, trade secrets and copyrights are important assets that it aggressively protects, but that such efforts may not always be sufficient, that protecting proprietary rights is costly and time-consuming and may not be successful, and that unauthorized copying and piracy are persistent problems resulting in lost revenues and increased expenses. It recognizes that the nature of its products and services necessitates timely product launches and that significant product quality problems or delays—particularly in its tax preparation software product development cycle, which must incorporate unpredictable tax law and form changes under condensed timetables—may lead to major defects or launch delays, loss of customers and revenue, negative publicity, customer and employee dissatisfaction, reduced retailer shelf space and promotions, and increased operating expenses including inventory replacement costs, legal fees or payments to reimburse customer penalties and interest resulting from calculation errors. The registrant acknowledges that its businesses are highly seasonal, with revenue concentrated from November through April and that it typically reports lower revenues and operating losses in the first and fourth fiscal quarters; although it expects seasonality to diminish in the longer term due to ongoing releases for desktop offerings and shifting to connected services, it anticipates that the seasonality of its consumer tax business will continue and that quarterly and annual financial results may fluctuate significantly due to factors such as timing of product releases, product mix, tax form availability, consumer behavior and the timing of acquisitions, divestitures and impairment charges. The company reports that it regularly invests resources to update and improve its internal IT systems and software platforms but cautions that if such investments do not succeed or if delays or other issues disrupt operations, it may experience outages, inability to deliver and develop offerings, loss of revenue or reputational harm that could impair its competitiveness. It notes that its international operations face inherent risks—including trade barriers, political and economic instability, differing user protection and data protection laws, compliance with anti-corruption, antitrust and competition regulations, import/export regulations, foreign currency restrictions and other government regulation—which increase its costs and may harm its operating results and financial condition. The registrant warns that actual product returns in excess of reserves may reduce net revenue and that unanticipated changes in income tax rates, continuous examination by tax authorities and changes in uncertain tax positions could materially affect its effective tax rate and financial results. It acknowledges that amortization of acquired intangible assets and goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges may cause significant fluctuations in net income, and that acquisitions and divestitures carry significant risks—including integration difficulties, inability to realize synergies, disruption of ongoing business, loss of key employees, unidentified due diligence issues, and foreign country risks—such that transactions may not be successful and may harm operating results or financial condition. The company’s senior unsecured notes and revolving credit facility impose restrictions and covenants that may adversely affect its flexibility, and breach could lead to acceleration of indebtedness; rating downgrades may increase interest expense, limit financing options and increase costs, all of which could affect liquidity. It is also subject to potential liabilities from content disseminated through its online services—and claims of defamation, libel, invasion of privacy, negligence or infringement may arise in multiple jurisdictions—any of which could result in legal costs that harm the business. The registrant recognizes that its stock price may be volatile and influenced by analyst recommendations, speculation, strategic announcements and economic conditions, with any significant drop potentially exposing it to securities class action lawsuits, substantial costs and diversion of management attention. It states that its business depends on its strong reputation and brand value and that adverse publicity, whether justified or not, could tarnish its reputation, reduce demand for its products and services, and require additional resources to rebuild its reputation and restore brand equity. In its management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, the company emphasizes that the markets for software and related services are dynamic and highly competitive, characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions; that its strategy depends on its ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, enter new markets and drive broad adoption of its offerings; and that its future growth increasingly depends on the strength of third-party business relationships, requiring significant investments of resources in product development, marketing, sales and in its information technology infrastructure and privacy and security capabilities. It notes that as it transitions to connected services, the continuing operation and availability of its own IT systems and those of its external service providers is becoming increasingly important. The registrant believes that its cash, cash equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations, together with its unsecured revolving credit facility and board-authorized share repurchase programs, will be sufficient to meet seasonal working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, contractual obligations, commitments, debt service requirements and other liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months, enabling it to respond nimbly to strategic opportunities and return excess cash to stockholders through repurchases and dividends.

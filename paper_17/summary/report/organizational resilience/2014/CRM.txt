The risk disclosures outline a range of organizational practices and contingencies that are intended to preserve functioning under adverse conditions, including the recognition that “errors or defects” in a complex service environment incorporating proprietary and third‐party software could lead to “unanticipated downtime” and harm to subscribers’ businesses, that customers may use services “in unanticipated ways” causing cascading disruptions, and that reliance on “third‐party data center hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers” means any “damage to, or failure of, our systems generally could result in interruptions in our services.” To mitigate such risks, the company maintains “current disaster recovery arrangements” under which its “production environment and all of our customers’ data is currently replicated in near real‐time in a facility located in the United States,” yet acknowledges that “even with disaster recovery arrangements, our services could be interrupted” by “earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures,” “acts of terrorism,” “unsuccessful data transfers” or “sabotage,” any of which could “reduce our revenue,” “cause customers to terminate their subscriptions” and “harm our business.” The disclosures further address security as a resilience mechanism, noting that unauthorized access to customer data by “computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise” or “attacks designed to temporarily deny customers access” could result in “loss of confidence in the security of our services,” “legal and financial exposure,” and disrupted operations. The company also warns that acquisitions and investments carry the risk of “difficulties in, and the cost of, integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel,” “diversion of financial and managerial resources,” the “need to implement controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company” and “challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences,” any of which may “disrupt our business,” “adversely affect our operating results,” and require reconfiguration of resources and processes to maintain continuity and adapt to evolving market, regulatory and operational pressures.

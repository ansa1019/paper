The Company’s Risk Factors disclosures describe a comprehensive framework of strategies, processes and resource allocations designed to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of internal or external disturbances, whether nominal, extreme or exceptional.  It routinely assesses a wide range of risks—from changes in laws and regulations that may require it to change the manner in which it conducts aspects of its businesses, to cyber-security threats arising from the hosting, collection, use and storage of large volumes of personal and business information, to market, interest-rate and liquidity risks affecting client funds—that could materially impair results or operations.  To mitigate these risks and maintain business continuity, the Company maintains disaster recovery, business continuity and crisis management plans and procedures for natural disasters, military or terrorist actions, power or communication failures and similar events, invests in robust information-security programs and controls and commits significant additional resources as threats evolve, and continually upgrades, enhances and expands its technology solutions to remain responsive to rapid technological advances and changing client needs.  It relies heavily on its payroll, financial, accounting and other data-processing systems, pre-impounds client funds to meet remittance obligations, and pursues a prudent, conservative client-funds investment strategy—laddering maturities out to five or ten years, investing predominantly in AAA/AA-rated fixed-income securities and securing short-term funding through commercial paper and reverse repurchase agreements—to enhance system integrity, liquidity and diversification and to average its way through interest-rate cycles.  The Company further strengthens its operational resilience through recurring revenues, strong client-retention and “pays per control” metrics, disciplined capital management—including share repurchases and consecutive dividend increases—and the use of committed revolving credit facilities, all of which support the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions and the ability to reconfigure its resources and strategic initiatives, such as the planned spin-off of the dealer services business, toward its core mission, innovation objectives and long-term firm performance.

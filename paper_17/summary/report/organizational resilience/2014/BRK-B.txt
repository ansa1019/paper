Berkshire Hathaway’s disclosures emphasize the continuation of operations under challenging conditions through proactive leadership succession planning, with the board having identified and agreed upon subsidiary managers capable of succeeding key executives and continually monitoring replacement risk to sustain organizational continuity. The Company’s highly decentralized business model depends on recruiting, training and retaining qualified management and operational personnel to execute business plans and meet customer demands, acknowledging that demographic shifts or unexpected surges in demand may strain resources and affect financial condition. A key strategy across its insurance operations is the maintenance of extraordinary capital strength—statutory surplus of approximately $129 billion as of December 31, 2014—to absorb underwriting volatility, negotiate bespoke reinsurance contracts and preserve underwriting performance despite catastrophe events. To mitigate operational disruptions, including cyber intrusions, the Company has implemented business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analyses. Senior corporate management directs significant capital allocation decisions, establishes corporate governance practices and communicates “tone at the top” messages while minimally involving headquarters in day-to-day subsidiary activities, thereby fostering operational flexibility and resilience. The railroad segment has responded to severe winter weather and service challenges by investing in line expansion, system improvement projects, additional equipment and personnel to maintain safe, reliable transportation services. Similarly, utilities and energy subsidiaries make ongoing capital investments to construct, operate and maintain generation, transmission and distribution systems over extended periods under evolving regulatory and funding environments to ensure reliable service in the face of regulatory and market perturbations. The finance and financial products group prioritizes ample liquidity and safety over yield in cash equivalents to maintain financial flexibility. Across its diverse businesses, Berkshire Hathaway’s strategic focus on leadership continuity, resource strength, adaptive capital deployment, decentralized decision making and continuity planning underpins its ability to absorb strain, adapt to disruptions and preserve or improve its functioning under adversity.

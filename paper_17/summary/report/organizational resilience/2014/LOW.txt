Lowe’s 10-K describes a comprehensive risk management process, administered by the chief risk officer and leveraging periodic surveys, external research, planning processes, risk mapping, analytics and other tools, to identify, evaluate and develop mitigation controls and procedures for operational, financial, environmental, reputational, strategic and other risks that could adversely affect the business and threaten operational continuity.  Recognizing that adapting to rapidly changing retail and economic environments is critical to maintaining functionality under adverse conditions, the company is transforming from a single-channel retailer into an omni-channel home improvement organization, increasing its urban market presence, investing extensively in on-line sales, content marketing and information-searching technology capabilities, and pursuing large, complex strategic initiatives—such as an enhanced sales & operations planning process and dedicated customer experience design team—that require integrated planning, cross-functional collaboration, new skill sets, leadership development and initiative prioritization to deliver relevant products, seamless fulfillment and differentiated customer experiences.  Lowe’s notes that failure to execute these transformational changes, to attract and retain personnel with requisite competencies or to maintain and protect critical information and customer-facing technology systems—including disaster recovery plans and cyber-security measures—could prevent realization of strategic benefits, impair competitive advantage and damage its reputation.  The company further acknowledges dependencies on third-party installers, key vendors and a complex domestic and international supply chain, as well as exposure to macro-economic cycles, demographic shifts, natural disasters, regulatory changes and competitive pressures, each of which demands operational flexibility, risk assessment, resource reconfiguration and compliance mechanisms to preserve or improve functioning, absorb strain and support resilience in the face of internal or external disturbances.

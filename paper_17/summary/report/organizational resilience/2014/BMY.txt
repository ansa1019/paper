The company acknowledges that a range of internal and external pressures—including intense competition from generic entrants, pricing and reimbursement constraints, supply chain disruptions, regulatory hurdles, litigation, cybersecurity threats and macroeconomic volatility—could significantly and negatively affect its business, prospects, financial condition, operating results or credit ratings and has therefore implemented risk assessment, resource allocation, strategic planning and business continuity processes to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.  Recognizing that loss of exclusivity, limited or blocked market access and downward pricing pressures from managed care organizations, institutional purchasers and government programs are major global challenges, the company reconfigures its portfolio through acquisitions, divestitures (for example, the diabetes business divestiture), alliances and targeted clinical collaborations to preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity.  It pursues disciplined capital allocation, expands its biologics manufacturing capacity, rationalizes facilities through restructuring and accelerated depreciation charges, and balances its research and development pipeline across early‐stage and late‐stage programs to ensure adaptability, operational flexibility and future orientation.  Reliance on suppliers, vendors, outsourcing partners and alliance partners to research, develop, manufacture, commercialize and distribute products has driven the development of business continuity plans, governance processes to monitor compliance with inventory management policies under the SEC consent order and comprehensive re‐engineering of accounting and financial reporting processes to mitigate risk and sustain organizational health.  Investments in industry‐appropriate cybersecurity protections, ongoing system monitoring and contingency planning reinforce system integrity and continuity of critical information technology infrastructure.  Through inter‐organizational collaboration, strategic initiatives with alliance partners, dynamic portfolio management and continuous improvement, the company seeks to absorb strain, maintain partial performance under adverse conditions and emerge stronger by leveraging its organizational capabilities, knowledge complexity and agile response strategies in turbulent markets.

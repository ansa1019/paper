Management has identified that our business continuity depends on maintaining supply assurance, technology leadership and low cost by executing supply strategies, including establishing alternate suppliers for critical technologies, and investing significant effort and resources to support and maintain these suppliers to reconstitute capacity, as failure to do so could harm our ability to meet delivery obligations, increase costs of sales or cause shortages of raw materials or manufacturing capacity. We manage liquidity and resource allocation by utilizing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by United States and foreign entities and generating free cash flow from operations, which we intend to reinvest in research and development and capital expenditures, strategic investments and to return 75% of free cash flow to stockholders through repurchases and dividends, with periodic determinations that such actions are in the best interests of our organization. We make substantial research, development and other investments, including acquisitions and strategic transactions, to innovate across 3G, 4G and emerging industries, deploying new business models and entering new industry segments—such as networking, mobile computing, small cell technology, connected home, automotive, high-speed connectivity, display technologies, data centers, mobile health, wireless charging, machine learning and robotics—in order to absorb strain from rapid technological change, environmental perturbations and competitive pressures while preserving functioning and maintaining performance. The integration of acquired businesses and technologies requires reallocating resources, developing key managerial and technical skills, reconfiguring processes and support systems, and confronting challenges such as retention of key employees, consolidation of research and development and supply operations, and consolidation of corporate infrastructures. We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents, prevent recurrence of unauthorized access or breaches and devote additional resources to information technology security to preserve organizational integrity and mitigate the adverse effects of hazards. We continuously assess risks—such as supply chain disruptions, intellectual property litigation, legislative and regulatory changes, currency fluctuations, economic downturns, concentration of customers and licensees, and product defects—to both foresee and adapt to disruptive change, manage variability, maintain operational flexibility and allocate financial and human resources to support continuity and future orientation.

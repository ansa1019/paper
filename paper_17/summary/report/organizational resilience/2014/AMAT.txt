Applied’s disclosures describe a comprehensive set of practices that support its ability to absorb strain and preserve performance under adverse and rapidly changing conditions, including the requirement “to meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves” by accurately forecasting demand and effectively managing resources and production capacity across multiple segments, the obligation “during periods of increasing demand” to maintain sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory, effectively manage its supply chain, attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, and control costs, and conversely “during periods of decreasing demand” to reduce costs, realign its cost structure with prevailing market conditions, manage its supply chain and retain key employees.  The company acknowledges that “uncertainty about future economic and industry conditions…makes it more challenging…to identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its businesses,” and that it “may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts, including restructuring activities,” in order to adapt its operations.  In response to persistent volatility in semiconductor, display and solar markets, Applied continually innovates and adapts its products and offerings—“developing new products (including disruptive technologies), improving and/or developing new applications for existing products, and adapting similar products for use by customers in different applications and/or markets with varying technical requirements’’—while maintaining operating flexibility to respond to different markets, customers and applications.  To enhance its systemic resilience, Applied conducts engineering, software development, manufacturing, sourcing and other operations in regions outside the United States and “adopts new procedures and processes for retaining and managing” third‐party providers “to realize the potential productivity and operational efficiencies, assure quality and continuity of supply, and protect the intellectual property of Applied and its customers, suppliers and other partners.”  Supply‐chain resilience is further addressed by identifying risks from “the failure or inability of suppliers to timely deliver sufficient quantities of quality parts on a cost‐effective basis,” volatility in materials availability and cost, import or export approval delays, and natural disasters, and by maintaining an allowance for doubtful accounts and inventory reserves to mitigate financial exposures.  The company also details preparedness measures for cybersecurity threats and incidents, compliance with “new, different, inconsistent or conflicting laws, rules and regulations,” and potential legal proceedings and claims that could “divert management’s attention and other Applied resources” or impose significant liabilities.  Finally, Applied’s liquidity and capital management strategies—including maintaining revolving credit facilities, managing an investment portfolio subject to credit, liquidity, foreign­exchange and market risks, and a disciplined share repurchase and dividend program—provide further financial resilience by ensuring access to resources and flexibility under internal or external variations and disturbances.

Mastercard maintains a comprehensive business continuity program to analyze risk, assess potential impacts and develop effective response strategies designed to preserve operational integrity and performance under both nominal and exceptional conditions, including the guarantee of settlement obligations backed by a $3 billion credit facility to provide liquidity in the event of one or more concurrent transaction settlement failures and risk management policies that govern exposure to credit, foreign exchange, legal and regulatory uncertainties. The company regularly reviews and tests its information security systems and infrastructure—including cyber-attack simulations, malware detection and controls over third-party service providers—to discover and address potential vulnerabilities, safeguard confidential and proprietary data, and prevent disruptions in payment processing, while monitoring geopolitical events, sanctions and privacy and data-protection regulations to ensure compliance and continuity of services. In managing its liquidity and capital resources, Mastercard relies on internally generated cash flow, available-for-sale investment securities and its revolving credit facility, and dynamically adjusts its legal entity and tax structures to optimize the global deployment of cash and manage the repatriation of foreign earnings. The firm devotes substantial management and financial resources to defend interchange fees in regulatory, legislative and litigation proceedings, conducts ongoing assessments of legal contingencies and establishes provisions for probable losses, and implements foreign exchange derivative activities to hedge currency exposures that could otherwise impair its transaction volumes and net revenue. Mastercard actively monitors political, economic and regulatory developments worldwide to identify risks and opportunities for strategic initiatives, invests in capacity growth and technology platforms to maintain seamless transaction processing, and pursues acquisitions, partnerships and brand-strengthening programs to reinforce its operational flexibility and resilience in a volatile payments environment.

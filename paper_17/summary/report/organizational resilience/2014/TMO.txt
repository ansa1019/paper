The company’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis describes a strategic approach to augment organic growth and preserve operational flexibility by integrating the $15.3 billion acquisition of Life Technologies into its Life Sciences Solutions segment and divesting non-core businesses to satisfy regulatory requirements and streamline its portfolio, thereby reconfiguring resource deployment and maintaining functioning under changing market and regulatory conditions.  It reports productivity improvements driven by its Practical Process Improvement business system, global sourcing initiatives, consolidation of facilities, headcount reductions and low-cost region manufacturing, alongside ongoing and planned restructuring actions expected to yield approximately $120 million of annual cost savings beginning in part in 2014 and more substantially in 2015.  Liquidity management is highlighted by cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.35 billion, a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility with undrawn capacity retained as a back-stop to commercial paper markets, and projected sufficiency of operating cash flows to fund existing businesses for at least the next 24 months, reflecting business continuity planning and resilience in financial resources.  Risk management practices include establishing allowances for doubtful accounts and inventory obsolescence, conducting impairment reviews of intangible and long-lived assets and goodwill when indicators arise, accruing warranty obligations and environmental, litigation and contingent liabilities, and maintaining rigorous revenue recognition and contingent consideration processes.  Operating across approximately 50 non-U.S. jurisdictions, the company manages foreign tax credits, cross-border cash distributions and sensitivity to statutory rate changes to sustain its effective tax rate and preserve global cash flow flexibility.  Lastly, the company’s analysis of contractual obligations—including operating and capital lease commitments, unconditional purchase obligations, letters of credit, guarantees, pension funding commitments and residual value guarantees under build-to-suit leases—demonstrates systematic assessment and mitigation of internal and external pressures to uphold system integrity and firm performance under adverse or uncertain conditions.

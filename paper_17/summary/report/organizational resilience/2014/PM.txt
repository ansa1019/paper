The annual report discloses that the Company has established backup systems and business continuity plans to protect critical information systems and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access or operational failures that could disrupt processes, incur litigation or regulatory penalties and damage its reputation, while acknowledging that economic, political, regulatory and natural disturbances—including civil unrest, regime changes, terrorism, conflicts, natural disasters and currency devaluations—could impair supply chains, manufacturing capabilities, distribution networks and staffing, thereby reducing volumes, revenues and net earnings. The Company further describes strategic initiatives to anticipate and respond to shifts in consumer preferences through brand equity promotion, pricing flexibility, development of new products and markets, broadening of brand portfolios and productivity improvements aimed at preserving margins, and it continues to invest in research and development of reduced-risk products subject to scientific substantiation and regulatory approval as part of its long-term resource reconfiguration and resilience strategy. Contingency measures include the potential replacement of third-party contract manufacturers or service providers with internal resources and the negotiated implementation of social plans in connection with factory closures and restructuring programs to manage asset impairment and exit costs while striving to maintain organizational functioning. In addition, the Company recognizes that counterfeiting, contraband and cross-border purchases and heightened governmental actions and litigation risks under the World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control may erode revenues and necessitate ongoing risk assessment, compliance measures and adaptive responses to preserve performance under pressure.

Nike recognizes that its ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning under adversity depends on robust management of its global supply chain, diversified distribution network, and information systems, and accordingly highlights potential business disruptions—from independent contract manufacturers failing to meet quality or delivery standards, to port strikes, transportation delays, and natural disasters—and mitigates such risks through business interruption insurance, continuity planning, and supply chain flexibility. The company further calls out interruptions in data and information technology systems related to demand and supply planning, inventory control, and digital commerce as risks to operational continuity and invests in globally integrated IT platforms, disaster recovery plans, and digital infrastructure to enable rapid adaptation and recovery. To blunt the impact of currency volatility and economic perturbations on product costs and revenues, Nike employs a centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program—including foreign currency adjustment agreements with factories, forward and option contracts hedging non-functional currency exposures, and net investment hedges—while maintaining committed credit facilities and investment-grade short-term securities to secure liquidity. Strategic initiatives aimed at fostering operational flexibility and competitive advantage—expanding gross margin through manufacturing efficiency, improving working capital effectiveness, deploying capital toward high-return opportunities, and driving operational excellence across demand creation and overhead—support the maintenance of performance under challenging conditions. The company’s futures ordering program, which secures retailer commitments months in advance, further enables demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and resource allocation, equipping the organization to confront shifts in consumer preferences, intense competition, and macroeconomic uncertainties with resilience and sustained growth.

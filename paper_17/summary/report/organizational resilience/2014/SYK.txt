The Company’s operations depend on the uninterrupted functioning of key information technology systems, processes and sites and on the timely effectiveness of its business continuity plans to compensate for disruptions ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches, failure of which could interrupt operations and harm its reputation or financial condition. To mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on transaction exposures and earnings, the Company enters into designated and non-designated forward currency exchange contracts and implements currency hedges, with realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in the consolidated statements of earnings or accumulated in other comprehensive income. Inventory management practices include maintaining reserves for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends, while accounts receivable days sales outstanding and inventory days on hand are monitored to manage liquidity. Operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures and is supplemented, as necessary, by debt financing, with the Company maintaining strong short-term and long-term debt ratings and approximately $1.3 billion of borrowing capacity under existing credit facilities to support operational continuity and strategic initiatives. Capital allocation priorities—to fund acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases—are managed in conjunction with periodic repatriation of foreign cash holdings to expand operations either organically or through acquisitions. The Company records assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations at estimated fair values, including goodwill and intangible assets, requiring significant judgment regarding future cash flows, discount rates and useful lives, and conducts annual qualitative and quantitative impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles based on discounted cash flows to preserve system integrity and performance under varying economic conditions. Legal and regulatory risks—including potential product liability claims, intellectual property litigation, healthcare reform uncertainty, pricing pressures, competitive dynamics and evolving tax regulations—are continually assessed, and liabilities for contingencies such as product recalls and uncertain tax positions are recorded at management’s best estimate or the minimum of probable loss, demonstrating structured risk identification, assessment and mitigation processes that align with the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

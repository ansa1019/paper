Abbvie has sustained organizational resilience by leveraging its global manufacturing and distribution infrastructure to provide adequate production capacity and ensure business continuity during material transitions, including the phased separation from its former parent under comprehensive transition services agreements that enabled independent operations prior to establishment of stand-alone back-office functions. Despite adverse external pressures such as generic competition in its lipid franchise and unfavorable foreign exchange movements, the company grew net sales by 6 percent in 2014, maintained gross margins through favorable product mix and operational efficiencies, and generated $3.5 billion of operating cash flow net of transaction and financing costs. Those cash flows supported strategically targeted resource allocation to research and development collaborations, regulatory approvals for new therapeutic regimens, expansion of product indications and emerging-market investments, and disciplined financial management including the declaration and increase of quarterly dividends, execution of a $5 billion share repurchase program, maintenance of flexible credit facilities, and active use of currency and interest rate hedges to mitigate market volatility. Abbvieâ€™s ongoing monitoring of customer creditworthiness and governmental receivables in challenged European markets, its diversified product portfolio, robust pipeline of over 40 clinical-stage assets, and sustained investment in strategic licensing and collaboration activities reflect its capacity to absorb strain, adapt to disruptive events, reconfigure trajectory toward future growth and preserve or improve functioning under challenging and changing conditions.

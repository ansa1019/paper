Facebook warns that “if any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected,” underscoring the need to preserve functionality and performance under adverse conditions through continuous risk assessment and mitigation. The company emphasizes its dependence on the ability to “maintain and scale our technical infrastructure,” noting that “our systems may not be adequately designed with the necessary reliability and redundancy to avoid performance delays or outages” and that failure to “effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure” could harm its business. It acknowledges that “we cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our growth,” as the “growth and expansion of our business and products create significant challenges for our management, operational, and financial resources” and that “the integration of acquisitions requires significant time and resources” and may “divert resources and management attention.” Facebook states that “from time to time, we may also take actions regarding the distribution of our products or the operation of our business based on what we believe to be in our long-term best interests,” and that it “prioritize[s] user growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results.” It highlights ongoing capital expenditures and acquisitions, routine “review of our processes for calculating these metrics” to improve data accuracy, reliance on key partnerships to ensure operational continuity, efforts to protect proprietary rights and software integrity, and maintenance of adequate liquidity and credit facilities since “if we default on our leasing and credit obligations, our operations may be interrupted” and if “we require additional capital to support our business growth … our business may be harmed.”

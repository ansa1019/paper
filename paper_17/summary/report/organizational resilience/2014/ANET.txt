The 10-K/A discloses that the Company’s limited operating history and rapid growth have placed significant strain on its management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure, requiring the expansion and improvement of internal systems and processes, operational and management controls and integrated financial and business information systems to preserve continuity and adapt to increased complexity. It warns that failure to manage growth effectively, improve systems or coordinate with third-party technology providers, contract manufacturers and sole-source suppliers could disrupt current operations, impair the ability to forecast revenue or control costs and jeopardize customer relationships. The report highlights the inherent unpredictability and variability of its results of operations due to factors such as a concentrated customer base, the timing and size of large end-customer purchases, customer budgeting and acceptance cycles, volume discounts, rapid technological shifts, competitive pricing pressures and supply chain delays or component shortages. It also identifies risks from product quality problems, warranty claims and product transitions, global expansion challenges, legal proceedings, compliance with export control and anti-corruption laws, cybersecurity threats and geopolitical and natural-disaster events—all of which underscore the Company’s need to absorb strain, maintain performance under internal and external disturbances and preserve organizational resilience in a turbulent business environment.

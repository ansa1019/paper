The annual report acknowledges a variety of external pressures and potential disruptions—economic downturns and sovereign debt crises, natural disasters and health epidemics, political unrest, currency volatility, cyber-attacks and evolving legal and regulatory regimes—that could impair the company’s operations, demand for its services and financial condition. In response, the company discloses a broad set of resilience measures designed to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning, including maintenance of redundant data centers and hosting services, disaster-recovery plans, business continuity insurance (albeit limited), foreign-exchange hedging programs, credit-risk and tax contingency accruals, cybersecurity controls and encryption, incident response protocols and on-going employee training. It highlights strategic resource allocation through significant cash reserves, a revolving credit facility, incremental debt issuances, acquisitions (such as Opentable and Kayak) and global expansion to diversify its geographical footprint and revenue streams. The report also details operational flexibility achieved by scalable technology infrastructure, dynamic marketing investments across online and offline channels, agile product development for web and mobile platforms, collaboration with travel and restaurant partners and ongoing enhancements to internal financial, legal and compliance controls. Together, these disclosures illustrate the company’s systemic approach to risk mitigation, adaptation and maintenance of performance under challenging conditions.

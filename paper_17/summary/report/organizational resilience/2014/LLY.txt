The Company’s resilience strategies include maintaining a continuous flow of successful new products and indications sufficient to replace revenues lost due to patent expirations or competitive displacement; investing in business continuity measures such as extensive controls, prevention, and response protocols to minimize the impact of system interruptions, information security breaches, and manufacturing disruptions arising from natural disasters, regulatory compliance issues, or supply constraints; implementing a controlled risk management program that employs derivative instruments to hedge exposures to interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations and conducting regular analyses of inventory levels, rebate accruals, and legal and tax contingencies to ensure operational flexibility and financial stability; allocating resources to strengthen employee training, third‐party data protection requirements, and supplier and alliance oversight while recognizing that outsourcing relationships and acquisitions—which may be disrupted by integration delays—require proactive adaptation to realize expected synergies and guard against material adverse effects on ongoing operations; and continually monitoring economic, legislative, and market dynamics, including creditworthiness of partners, healthcare policy changes, and reimbursement frameworks, to preserve organizational integrity and maintain performance under both nominal and exceptional conditions.

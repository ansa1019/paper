The Company’s disclosures reflect a systemic perspective on resilience by explicitly considering “the interrelationship and compounding effects of two or more risks occurring simultaneously” and by maintaining continuity through diversified manufacturing and financing arrangements.  It relies on GlobalFoundries and third-party wafer foundries and assemblers under long-term wafer supply agreements with fixed pricing, volume purchase commitments, transition and termination provisions, and negotiates amendments to manage capacity, pricing and technology migration.  The Company regularly assesses markets for external financing opportunities, maintains a secured revolving credit facility with covenant and liquidity tests, and uses interest rate swap agreements to manage exposures to interest rate risk.  As part of its transformation initiatives, the Company has implemented a business strategy to refocus toward high-growth adjacent markets, realigned its organizational structure into computing and graphics and enterprise, embedded and semi-custom segments, and launched a global restructuring plan designed to improve operating efficiencies through headcount reductions, real estate footprint optimization and ongoing monitoring of operational savings.  The Company also continuously invests in research and development to support new product introductions and industry transitions, manages inventory levels to avoid excess or obsolescence, restructures its debt maturity profile through note repurchases and new issuances, and adapts its supply-chain commitments, all to ensure it can absorb strain, preserve functioning and maintain performance under challenging market and economic conditions.

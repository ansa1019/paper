We believe we have appropriate policies, processes and internal controls to ensure the stability of our information technology, provide security from unauthorized access to our systems and maintain business continuity, yet we acknowledge that our business could be subject to significant disruption by unanticipated system failures, data corruption or unauthorized access to our systems. We rely on our information technology environment and certain critical databases, systems and applications to support key product and service offerings, and although we have disaster recovery plans that include backup facilities for our primary data centers, our systems are not always fully redundant and our disaster planning may not always be sufficient or effective. A disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which we are located—including human error, natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, sabotage, terrorism or political unrest—may impair our ability to service and interact with our clients. We rely on third-party providers to furnish essential services, and if those providers fail to perform effectively or to expand their services to meet our needs, we may experience business disruption, processing inefficiencies or harm to employee morale. We are also in the process of changing certain of our financial processing systems to an enterprise-wide solution, with no assurance that these changes will deliver expected benefits, which could impact our ability to process transactions accurately and efficiently. To realign our resource base and sharpen our focus on core capabilities, we have divested selected non-core assets, reduced our real estate footprint and redirected after-tax proceeds toward targeted acquisitions, investments and share repurchases. We recognize that our ability to create growth and drive performance rests on operational excellence, productivity, risk management, compliance and talent development, and we acknowledge that acquisitions and strategic transactions entail significant challenges and risks—particularly in the integration process, where we may require more resources than anticipated, assume unintended liabilities, fail to retain key personnel or divert management’s focus from other business operations. In addition, changes in the legislative, regulatory and commercial environments in which we operate may materially and adversely impact our ability to collect, compile, use and publish data, while cybersecurity exposures—including breaches, denial-of-service attacks, malware, hacking or insider malfeasance—may cause material interruptions or malfunctions in our websites, applications or data processing or compromise the confidentiality and integrity of our information, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

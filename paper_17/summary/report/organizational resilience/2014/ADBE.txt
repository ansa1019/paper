The report repeatedly underscores the company’s efforts to sustain operations and preserve functionality amid evolving technological, market and security pressures, warning, for example, that “if we cannot continue to develop, market and offer new products and services or enhancements to existing products and services that meet customer requirements, our operating results could suffer,” and noting that “we must make long-term investments, develop or obtain appropriate intellectual property and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand.” It acknowledges that “if we are unable to extend our core technologies into new applications and new platforms and to anticipate or respond to technological changes, the market’s acceptance of our products and services could decline,” and that “introduction of new products, services and business models by existing and new competitors could harm our competitive position.” The company emphasizes its reliance on strategic relationships and inter-organizational collaboration, cautioning that “if we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our strategic relationships with these third parties, our ability to compete in the marketplace, to reach new customers and geographies or to grow our revenues would be impaired.” Recognizing the shift to cloud and subscription models, it describes the resulting “risks related to the timing of revenue recognition and potential reductions in cash flows” and the need for “continued investment in product development and cloud operations,” while acknowledging that “these security vulnerabilities cannot be totally eliminated” and that “any interruptions or delays in these hosted services, security or privacy breaches, or failures in data collection could expose us to liability and harm our business and reputation.” It further details investments in “rigorous penetration tests, deploying security updates to address security vulnerabilities and improving our incident response time,” yet warns that “a disruption, infiltration or failure of these systems or third-party hosted services in the event of a major earthquake, fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, software or hardware malfunctions, cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions, reputational harm, loss of intellectual property, delays in our product development, lengthy interruptions in our services, breaches of data security and loss of critical data,” and concedes that “our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities.” Finally, the company stresses the importance of human capital and knowledge continuity, noting that “if we are unable to recruit and retain key personnel our business may be harmed” and that “our failure to enable the effective transfer of knowledge and facilitate smooth transitions of our key employees could adversely affect our long-term strategic planning and execution.”

Boeing emphasizes its capability to maintain operations under pressure through strategies that promote operational flexibility, continuous monitoring and mitigation of external and internal risks, and diversified resource allocation. The company notes that it “continues to increase production rates for the 737 and 787 programs, while at the same time engaging in significant ongoing development of the 787-10, 737 max and 777x aircraft,” and that it “seeks opportunities to reduce the costs of building our aircraft, including working with our suppliers to reduce supplier costs, identifying and implementing productivity improvements, and optimizing how we manage inventory.” It maintains “an extensive network of technical security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms, monitoring systems and management oversight in order to address” threats such as cyber-attacks, and “continues to monitor political unrest involving Russia and Ukraine” to anticipate supply-chain risks. Boeing acknowledges that “operational challenges impacting the production system for one or more of our commercial aircraft programs could result in production delays,” and accordingly manages a network of suppliers and subcontractors, noting that if “one or more of our suppliers or subcontractors experiences delivery delays or other performance problems, we may be unable to meet commitments to our customers or incur additional costs,” and that “any service disruption from one of these suppliers … could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments to our customers or increase our operating costs.” The company’s workforce strategy accommodates potential labor disruptions, acknowledging that “some of our … workforces are represented by labor unions, which may lead to work stoppages,” and it has announced that employees will “transition in 2016 to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan” to reduce future pension risks. Financial resilience is supported by “substantial borrowing capacity” including a commercial paper program and revolving credit facilities as “backup liquidity” to fund operations, contractual commitments and strategic investments, while a diversified strategic portfolio that “offsets cyclicality of commercial and defense markets” enhances Boeing’s ability to absorb economic and industry perturbations. Finally, Boeing’s risk management processes extend to environmental, regulatory and legal domains, recognizing that “business disruptions could seriously affect our future sales and financial condition or increase our costs and expenses,” and it maintains contingency planning, insurance coverage and other mechanisms to preserve continuity and performance under challenging conditions.

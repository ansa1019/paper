Bank of America has established a comprehensive enterprise risk management framework that supports organizational resilience by defining clear risk categories—strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance and operational—and by embedding a formal risk appetite statement into its strategic, capital and financial planning processes to ensure the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions. The board and its committees, including the enterprise risk committee, audit committee and credit committee, oversee adherence to this framework, which is implemented through a three‐lines‐of‐defense structure consisting of front‐line operating units, independent risk management and corporate audit. Centralized corporate treasury functions maintain excess liquidity sources and diverse funding strategies in compliance with liquidity coverage and net stable funding ratio requirements, monitor time‐to‐required‐funding metrics and execute contingency funding plans, while stress testing and scenario analyses—including corporation‐wide and trading‐portfolio models—assess the impacts of adverse market and credit environments on balance sheet, earnings, capital and liquidity. Dedicated processes for credit risk management, including model‐based loss forecasting, concentration limits, and collateral and derivative hedges, along with procedures for managing market risks via value‐at‐risk, derivative hedges and trading limits, further bolster the firm’s ability to absorb strain, reconfigure portfolios and preserve system integrity. Ongoing actions such as recovery and resolution planning, risk and control self‐assessments, and enhancements to controls, processes and governance collectively enable the organization to foresee, confront and benefit from unexpected disruptions, thereby preserving its functioning and competitive advantage in both nominal and exceptional conditions.

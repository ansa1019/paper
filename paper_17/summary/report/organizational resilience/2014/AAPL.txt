The company acknowledges that its operations and performance could be materially and adversely affected by financial turmoil in the banking system and markets, including tightening credit, low liquidity and extreme volatility that could restrict its ability to issue new debt; it depends on outsourcing partners for manufacturing sub-assemblies and final assembly, which lower operating costs but reduce its direct control over production and distribution and create uncertainty regarding product quality, quantity and its flexibility to respond to changing conditions; the company maintains system redundancy and disaster recovery planning, but these measures may be ineffective or inadequate for all eventualities, and system failures or network disruptions could prevent access to its online stores and services, impede manufacturing and shipping, compromise company or customer data, and delay or cancel orders, exposing it to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences; breaches of its information technology systems could materially damage business partner and customer relationships, curtail access to services or subject it to litigation and liability; natural and man-made disasters, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues or other events beyond its control could decrease demand, make it difficult or impossible to make and deliver products or receive components, create delays and inefficiencies in its supply chain, and in the event of a natural disaster the company could incur significant losses, require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations; to secure component availability the company enters into purchase commitments covering forecasted requirements up to 150 days and records accruals for estimated cancellation fees, but demand forecasting errors or changes in product plans may result in excess or insufficient inventory or unexpected cancellation liabilities; it records write-downs for inventory, capital assets and prepayments that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand and reviews these assets for impairment when events indicate potential recoverability issues, yet the rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes may require additional related charges; to manage liquidity and interest rate risk the company accesses commercial paper markets, issues long-term debt and utilizes interest rate swaps; and it has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, although no assurance can be given that such measures will prevent violations or fully mitigate risks.

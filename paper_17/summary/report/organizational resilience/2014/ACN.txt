Accenture’s disclosures recognize that ongoing economic volatility and uncertainty can undermine business confidence, disrupt client spending and complicate accurate forecasting of demand and the effective construction of revenue and resource plans. The firm emphasizes its dependence on maintaining a balanced supply of skills and resources worldwide, deploying employees globally, adjusting hiring levels and, where necessary, rebalancing its workforce—including through involuntary terminations—to align capacity with client demand and preserve contract profitability. While it has established business continuity and disaster recovery plans, Accenture admits they may be challenged by acts of terrorism, political unrest, natural disasters, severe weather events, global health emergencies, system failures, security breaches and cyberattacks, any of which could interrupt communications, disrupt critical processes or cause downtime that materially impairs the delivery of services. The company further acknowledges reliance on complex information‐technology networks and systems that, if breached or disabled, could lead to unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data, legal liability, reputational harm and loss of clients. To mitigate these internal and external pressures, Accenture employs cost‐management strategies—including realigning operations to lower‐cost locations, optimizing service delivery, adjusting pricing and resource mix, and investing in innovation and emerging technologies—to sustain operational flexibility, support resilience against market and environmental disruptions, maintain competitive advantage and enable ongoing growth.

Comcast’s 2014 Form 10-K recognizes that “all of our businesses operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environments” where “technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and influencing consumer behavior,” and warns that “changes in consumer behavior driven by newer products and services may adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models.” To preserve functioning and performance under these pressures, the company describes efforts to “leverage our cable services network” by “expanding and enhancing our business services to medium-sized businesses,” “launching additional services, such as our home security and automation services,” and adapting to new viewing patterns by “deploying our X1 platform and cloud DVR technology.” It notes that “programming expenses … are expected to continue to be our cable communications segment’s largest single expense item and to increase in the foreseeable future” and that it “attempt[s] to maintain a consistent operating margin … through rate adjustments, the sale of additional cable services … and by achieving operating efficiencies.” The report highlights the criticality of “network and information systems … related to our network management, customer service operations and programming delivery,” warning that “computer hackings, cyber attacks, … terrorist attacks or other similar events … could result in a degradation or disruption of our services” and require “large expenditures to repair or replace the damaged properties, networks or information systems or to protect them from similar events in the future,” while also acknowledging that “the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated.” Supply-chain resilience is pursued by “actively” monitoring “the operations and financial condition of key vendors in an attempt to detect any potential difficulties,” and regulatory resilience is maintained via compliance programs designed to prevent “administrative enforcement actions, fines, and civil and criminal liability.” Additionally, strategic initiatives across the NBCUniversal segments include substantial investments in original programming and sports programming rights, continued development of new theme-park attractions and other content investments to diversify revenue streams and preserve performance under pressure. Although not labeled as such, these resource allocations, adaptation strategies, risk assessments and operational flexibilities together embody a systemic orientation toward preserving integrity and maintaining performance under internal and external disturbances, consistent with organizational resilience.

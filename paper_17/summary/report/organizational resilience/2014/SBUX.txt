Starbucks discloses that it operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment, where new factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict the impact of all these factors on its business, financial condition or results of operation. It warns that decreases in customer traffic or average transaction values can result in sales de-leveraging and downward pressure on margins and comparable store sales under adverse economic conditions that may persist or worsen. The unauthorized access, theft or destruction of customer or employee data or of proprietary information in its information technology systems may require significant capital investments and other expenditures, including additional security technologies, personnel, experts and credit monitoring services, to remedy problems and prevent future breaches, and that media reports of actual or perceived vulnerabilities could materially harm its reputation, which has led Starbucks to make significant investments in technology, third party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and prevent breaches or data loss, while acknowledging these measures cannot provide assurance of success. The company recognizes that incidents involving food-borne illnesses, contamination, mislabeling or supply-chain failures could force temporary store or facility closures, product recalls and have a negative impact on its brand and financial results. Starbucks states that it may not succeed in implementing important strategic initiatives or effectively managing growth, which are designed to create growth, improve results of operations and drive long-term shareholder value through leveraging its brand portfolio, focusing on product innovation and new growth platforms, balancing global store openings and renovations, executing multi-channel marketing, and pursuing strategic acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures. It further acknowledges that effectively managing growth requires balancing flexibility and autonomy for local management against consistency with corporate goals, ensuring a consistent supply of high-quality raw materials, hiring and training sufficient numbers of key employees, and maintaining effective internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise. The company notes that interruption of its supply chain—whether due to plant casualties, logistics provider failures, trade restrictions, embargoes, customs restrictions or natural disasters—could impact its ability to produce or deliver products and negatively affect profitability. It also discloses that its disaster recovery and business continuity plans may not resolve issues arising from technology failures, power outages, catastrophic events or cyber-attacks, potentially causing material negative impacts to product availability, sales, operational efficiency and financial results. Starbucks manages market-based risks through a market price risk management policy under which commodity price exposures are partially mitigated through supply contracts and hedging, and limits are set to prohibit speculative trading; however, volatility in the price or availability of high-quality arabica coffee, dairy and other commodities can adversely affect profitability. In managing financial flexibility, the company expects future cash flows and existing cash and investments domestically and internationally to be sufficient to finance core operations, capital requirements including for new stores and technology investments, shareholder distributions and potential additional funding for significant new joint ventures or acquisitions such as the acquisition and integration of Starbucks Japan; it has also repurchased shares and maintained dividends to return cash to shareholders. The disclosures further reflect awareness of risks from labor discord, war, terrorism, political instability, boycotts, social unrest, pandemics and energy supply disruptions, as well as legal and regulatory compliance obligations, and the potential need for additional compliance costs, all of which may require adaptive measures to preserve or improve functioning under internal or external disturbances.

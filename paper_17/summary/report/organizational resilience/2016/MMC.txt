The company’s disclosures emphasize its reliance on uninterrupted information technology systems and networks to operate its business and securely process, transmit and store electronic information, while acknowledging that advanced persistent cyber-attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, human error or compromised vendor credentials could materially disrupt operations and damage its reputation. It describes case-level reviews by counsel, internal actuarial analyses and quarterly adjustments to establish liabilities for errors and omissions claims and other legal contingencies, reflecting a process to absorb strain and estimate losses under unpredictable adverse conditions. The firm underscores its business continuity and disaster recovery planning, noting that its ability to function in the event of earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, pandemics, power or telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks or other disruptions depends on the continued availability of personnel, facilities and properly functioning systems, and that its current plans, management succession protocols and business disruption insurance may not suffice to prevent material financial loss, human capital depletion, reputational harm or regulatory actions. In describing its acquisition strategy, the company highlights the complexity and risk inherent in integrating acquired entities’ information systems and operations, warning that delayed or inadequate integration can expose it to unexpected liabilities, operational fragmentation and increased cyber-risk. The firm also details its dependence on numerous third-party vendors and subcontractors for critical functions—technology support, data processing, security and administration—observing that any interruption or cessation of these services could disrupt service delivery, incur contractual or regulatory penalties and impair its operational flexibility. It further cautions that macroeconomic and political events—including protectionist measures, Brexit, shifts in client demand, market volatility and strengthened U.S. dollar translation—could reduce demand for its services, depress pricing and create liquidity constraints, necessitating strategic reconfiguration of resources, reallocation of capital and adaptation of its business model to preserve performance under turbulent market conditions. Finally, the company recognizes that fluctuations in its defined benefit pension obligations, contingent acquisition payments, debt maturities and the timing of dividend repatriations may cause significant variability in its financial position and cash flows, underscoring the importance of prudent capital planning, diversified financing sources and ongoing stress testing to maintain organizational continuity and resilience.

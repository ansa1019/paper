The company’s operating results have been in the past, and will continue to be, subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors, some of which the company attempts to mitigate by maintaining appropriate inventory levels and purchase commitments and by increasing its efforts in procuring components to meet customer expectations when facing component supply-related challenges. It notes that inventory management remains an area of focus as it balances the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. The company plans its operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels, though it acknowledges that these expenses are relatively fixed in the short term and may inhibit rapid cost adjustment in response to short-term business changes. It has been investing and expects to continue to invest in key priority and growth areas while realigning and dedicating resources into security, IoT, collaboration, next-generation data center, cloud, and software, and it recognizes that the benefits of these investments may be delayed or develop more slowly than expected. As part of its transformation, the company continues to make changes to how it is organized and how it builds and delivers its technology, evolving from selling individual products and services toward selling products and services integrated into architectures and solutions. It depends upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and warns that failure to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs can materially harm its business, underscoring the need for strategic foresight and adaptability. In response to industry and market changes, including industry consolidation and evolving competitive landscapes, it may be required to strategically realign resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could entail inventory and technology write-offs, workforce reduction or restructuring costs, and consolidation of excess facilities. Across its risk factors, the company outlines its exposure to economic, geopolitical, regulatory, and supply chain disruptions and the measures it takes—such as diversifying manufacturing capacity, adjusting procurement practices, and maintaining financial flexibility—to absorb strain and preserve or improve its functioning despite adversity.

The Company maintains policies, processes and internal controls designed to ensure the stability of its information technology, provide security from unauthorized access to its systems and maintain business continuity, but acknowledges that unanticipated system failures, data corruption or cybersecurity breaches could materially disrupt operations. It regularly assesses and improves its business continuity plans and key management succession and maintains disaster recovery plans including backup facilities for its primary data centers, yet notes that its systems are not always fully redundant and disaster planning may not always be effective. The Company warns that events such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, pandemics, terrorist attacks, cyber attacks, power losses or telecommunications failures could impede the availability of personnel, office facilities and IT systems and materially interrupt its operations. It also recognizes the risk that outsourcing arrangements for critical support functions may fail to meet required performance, confidentiality or compliance standards, leading to unauthorized access, network disruptions, regulatory penalties and reputational harm. The Company relies heavily on network systems and the internet for electronic delivery of products and services, which are exposed to infrastructure failures, software vulnerabilities, human error, third-party service outages and increased regulation. Despite significant investments in information technology data centers, software and infrastructure, and measures to provide security and maintain continuity, the Company cautions that these measures may be insufficient, circumvented or become obsolete, and that evolving cyber threats and natural or man-made disasters could cause disruptions, reputational harm, loss of customers, regulatory actions, litigation or financial losses that may not be fully insured. It further discloses that it regularly reviews exposures from litigation, regulatory proceedings and the integration of acquisitions, continuously assesses its ability to predict outcomes and record liabilities, and expects cash on hand, cash flows from operations and availability under its credit facility to be sufficient to meet operating and recurring cash needs in the foreseeable future, while noting that severe market or regulatory changes could affect liquidity and operational flexibility.

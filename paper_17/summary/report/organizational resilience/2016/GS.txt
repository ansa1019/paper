Despite the resiliency plans and facilities we have in place, our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which we are located, including electrical, satellite, undersea cable or other communications, internet, transportation or other services facilities used by us or third parties, which in turn may prevent us from successfully implementing contingency plans that depend on communication or travel. Notwithstanding our efforts to maintain business continuity, given that our headquarters and the largest concentration of our employees are in the New York metropolitan area, a catastrophic event such as extreme weather or terrorism could negatively affect our business. We maintain a contingency funding plan that provides a framework for analyzing and responding to liquidity crises, outlining potential risk factors, key reports and metrics, as well as detailed mitigants such as prefunding our estimated cash and collateral needs and utilizing secondary sources of liquidity. Our global core liquid assets are structured to meet a broad range of potential cash outflows and collateral requirements in a stressed environment, thereby enhancing system resilience in funding and settlement. The global business resilience committee oversees business resilience initiatives, promotes security and resilience across operations, and reviews key operational risks. As part of our recovery and resolution planning process, we develop strategies to reduce risk, conserve capital and maintain sufficient liquidity under severely adverse conditions, which may include holding additional capital or issuing long-term debt. Our capital planning process incorporates stress testing using both regulator-provided and internally designed scenarios to ensure we remain adequately capitalized and liquid during baseline and severely adverse conditions. Operational risk management policies, including an annual operational risk and control self-assessment by managers in both revenue-producing units and independent control functions, are designed to identify and mitigate risks arising from system failures, human error, regulatory change or external events.

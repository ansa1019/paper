We have developed a risk management process using periodic surveys, external research, planning processes, risk mapping, analytics and other tools to identify and evaluate the operational, financial, environmental, reputational, strategic and other risks that could adversely affect our business, and our risk management framework, administered by our chief financial officer, includes developing risk mitigation controls and procedures for the material risks we identify. We acknowledge that we may be unable to adapt our business concept in a rapidly evolving retail environment to address the changing shopping habits, demands and demographics of our customers, or realize the intended benefits of organizational change initiatives, and that our success is dependent on our ability to identify and respond to the economic, social, style and other trends that affect demographic and consumer preferences in a variety of our merchandise categories and service offerings. Our interactions with customers have evolved into an omni-channel experience as they increasingly use computers, tablets, mobile phones and other devices to shop in our stores and online and provide feedback and public commentary about all aspects of our business, and omni-channel retail is quickly evolving such that we must anticipate and meet our customers’ expectations and counteract new developments and technology investments by our competitors while delivering large, complex programs requiring more integrated planning, initiative prioritization and program sequencing, and developing new competencies in many positions so that our management, employees and contractors can adapt and learn new skills and capabilities. We recognize that our customer-facing technology systems must appeal to our customers, function as designed and provide a consistent customer experience, and that performance issues with these systems, including temporary outages caused by distributed denial of service, ransomware or other cyber-attacks, or a complete failure of one or more of them without a disaster recovery plan that can be quickly implemented, could quickly destroy the positive benefits they provide and negatively affect our customers’ perceptions of us as a reliable online vendor and source of information about home improvement products and services. As with many other retailers, we receive and store certain personal information about our customers, employees and vendors, and despite our continued vigilance and investment in information security, we or our third-party service providers may be unable to adequately anticipate or prevent a breach in our or their systems that results in the unauthorized release of sensitive data, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, drive customers away and lead to financial losses from remedial actions or potential liability, including possible punitive damages. We further recognize that we must hire, train, manage and retain qualified sales associates and specialists with expanded skill sets and corporate support staff with the capabilities of delivering on strategic objectives, and that our inability to do so could reduce the quality of service we provide to our customers and negatively affect our results of operations. We also acknowledge that failure to effectively and efficiently manage and maintain our relationships with selected suppliers of brand name products or third-party vendors and service providers that are the sole or primary source of some of the products or services we sell—particularly those with specialized skills or technology solutions critical to our business—could disrupt our operations and have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. If our domestic or international supply chain or our fulfillment network is ineffective or disrupted for any reason, including trade policy changes, political instability, natural disasters, weather-related events, work stoppages, shipping capacity restraints or changes in transportation availability and costs, our results of operations could be adversely affected. We recognize that our strategic transactions, such as mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures and other growth strategies, involve risks and numerous uncertainties—including our ability to integrate personnel, financial, information technology and other systems successfully; to avoid disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management; and to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies—and that integration of businesses into our financial and internal control systems may create complexity that could impair our ability to meet our financial reporting obligations. We must comply with numerous and varied laws and regulations at the local, regional, state, federal and international levels, and changes in existing or new laws or regulatory enforcement priorities, or our inability to comply with them, could subject us to government enforcement action, litigation, fines and penalties and could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and results of operations. We are involved in lawsuits, regulatory inquiries and governmental proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business, and future litigation or proceedings could require substantial payments, divert management’s attention and resources and have a material adverse effect on our business. An important part of our efforts to provide an omni-channel experience for our customers includes investing in, maintaining and making ongoing improvements to our management information systems that support sales, inventory replenishment, ordering, project design and execution, transportation, receipt processing and fulfillment, all of which are subject to damage or interruption as a result of catastrophic events, power outages, viruses, malicious attacks or telecommunications failures and may incur significant expense, data loss and erosion of customer confidence. Finally, our liquidity and access to capital rely on efficient, rational and open capital markets and on our credit strength, and any disruption in the financial markets or downgrade of our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to fund our capital investments, working capital needs and strategic initiatives.

T-Mobile’s disclosures emphasize multiple dimensions of its operational resilience and continuity planning, noting for example that “system failures and business disruptions may allow unauthorized use of or interference with our network and other systems which could materially adversely affect our reputation and financial condition,” and that reliance “upon both our systems and networks and the systems and networks of other providers and suppliers” means that “failure of our or others’ systems, networks, or infrastructure may prevent us from providing reliable service or may allow for the unauthorized use of or interference with our networks and other systems or for the compromise of customer information.” The company acknowledges exposure to risks including human error, physical damage, power surges or outages, equipment failure, severe weather, natural disasters, terrorist attacks and acts of war, and warns that “such events could cause us to lose customers, lose revenue, incur expenses, suffer reputational and goodwill damages, and subject us to litigation or governmental investigation,” with remediation costs potentially including “liability for information loss, repairing infrastructure and systems, and/or costs of incentives offered to customers” that may not be insured. Highlighting the need for adaptation, T-Mobile states that it regularly reviews “procedures and safeguards to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data and to defend against attacks seeking to disrupt our services,” but concedes that “the ever-evolving threat landscape requires us to continually evaluate and adapt our systems and processes” and that it “cannot assure you that the preventive actions we take will be adequate to repel a significant attack or prevent information security breaches.” The risk factors further describe implementation of a new billing system as a critical change initiative where “any unanticipated difficulties, disruption, or significant delays could have adverse operational, financial, and reputational effects on our business,” prompting parallel operation of legacy and new platforms to mitigate transition risk. T-Mobile also identifies its dependence on third-party suppliers and service providers—“our business is complex, and it is not unusual for multiple vendors located in multiple locations to help us to develop, maintain, and troubleshoot products and services,” and warns that disruptions or failures by such suppliers “could have a material adverse effect on our business” or severely disrupt operations if key suppliers “fail to comply with their contracts or become unable to continue the supply due to patent or other intellectual property infringement actions or other disruptions.” The company underscores its sensitivity to macro-economic and political conditions, noting that “market volatility, political and economic uncertainty, and weak economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business and financial performance,” and that restrictive covenants in debt agreements “could limit our ability to react to changes in our operating environment or the economy,” while high leverage “could limit our flexibility” and “place us at a competitive disadvantage.” Further, T-Mobile points to the criticality of effective financial controls—“failure to design and maintain effective internal controls, including those over our IT systems, could constitute a material weakness that could result in inaccurate financial statements, inaccurate disclosures, or failure to prevent fraud”—and warns that high rates of fraud in device financing or customer credit “could have a materially adverse impact” if detection strategies are unsuccessful. The company’s resilience strategy also encompasses talent management—“our future success depends in substantial part on our ability to recruit, hire, motivate, develop, and retain talented and highly-skilled personnel” amid significant change—and ongoing network investment to adapt to “significant technological changes” such as 5G, while acknowledging that new technology deployments “may result in implementation issues such as scheduling and supplier delays, unexpected or increased costs, technological constraints, regulatory permitting issues, customer dissatisfaction, and other issues that could cause delays,” any of which “could have a material adverse effect on our business.” Finally, T-Mobile’s framework for continuous regulatory and legal monitoring reflects an understanding that changes in FCC rules or adverse litigation outcomes “could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results,” embodying the capacity to absorb strain and maintain performance under diverse internal and external pressures consistent with academic definitions of organizational resilience.

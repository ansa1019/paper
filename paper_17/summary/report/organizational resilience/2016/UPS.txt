UPS’s annual report discloses a comprehensive resilience framework grounded in the “maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions,” reflecting the Company’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite economic cycles, competitive consolidation and regulatory, security, environmental or operational disturbances. UPS monitors and adjusts its business model to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in industrial production, consumer spending and retail activity; conducts extensive risk assessment and continues to refine its capital investment forecasting, matching projected volume levels to aircraft, vehicles, technology and facility needs; transfers and hedges fuel, currency and interest‐rate exposures through indexed fuel surcharges, derivative instruments and hedging transactions; continually reconfigures air and ground network capacity, leverages facility automation and deploys its on‐road integrated optimization and navigation system (“ORION”) to enhance operational flexibility, reliability and efficiency; maintains diversified geographic and product portfolios to preserve performance under internal or external variations; negotiates labor and postretirement benefits, including transferring healthcare liabilities to multiemployer funds, to control pension and welfare costs and reduce balance‐sheet volatility; manages self-insurance, high-deductible insurance programs and contingent liabilities to preserve operating margins; invests in technology, strategic alliances and acquisitions (such as Coyote Logistics and Marken) to reconstitute capabilities, foster service innovation and bolster resource generation; enforces stringent compliance, security and disaster‐response protocols to ensure business continuity in the face of terrorism, natural or manmade disasters, strikes, data breaches or regulatory changes; and employs proactive liquidity and capital management, including share repurchases, dividend policies and credit facilities, to sustain organizational strength, system integrity and agility, thereby embodying resilience as an organizational capability for adaptation, risk mitigation and sustained performance across nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.

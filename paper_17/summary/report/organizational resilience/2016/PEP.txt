The annual report describes an integrated risk management framework—comprising board and audit committee oversight, a cross‐functional risk committee, division and country risk committees, a risk management office, corporate audit and a compliance & ethics department—established to identify, assess, prioritize and mitigate strategic, operational, financial, compliance, safety and reputational risks, thereby supporting business continuity and positive adjustment under challenging conditions. The Company employs global purchasing programs, fixed‐price contracts and purchase orders, and hedging with commodity, foreign‐currency and interest‐rate derivatives, as well as net investment hedges, to manage price volatility and exchange‐rate fluctuations; it diversifies raw‐material sourcing across multiple geographies and suppliers and maintains a network of authorized bottlers and distributors to preserve supply and distribution integrity in the face of weather, political unrest, health epidemics, cyber incidents, power or water outages, labor disruptions or logistical constraints. Productivity initiatives since 2012—encompassing manufacturing automation, shared services, go‐to‐market re-engineering and simplified organizational structures—have delivered over one billion dollars in annual savings, enhanced operational flexibility and strengthened the Company’s ability to recover from disruptions and reconfigure resources toward key objectives. In support of long-term system resilience, the Company invests in water conservation, energy efficiency, waste reduction and sustainable farming practices to safeguard critical inputs and sustain performance under environmental stress. The “Performance with Purpose” strategy further aligns resource allocation and strategic initiatives—product reformulation, retail collaboration, workforce development, digital and e-commerce capabilities, employee training and diversity—to foster organizational health, innovation capacity, stakeholder engagement and the firm’s ability to adapt, transform and emerge stronger from disruptive change.

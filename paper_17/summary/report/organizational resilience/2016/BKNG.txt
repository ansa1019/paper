We disclose that our operations are designed to absorb and adapt to a wide array of internal and external disturbances—from macro‐economic downturns, sovereign debt and currency volatility (notably “Brexit”) to terrorist attacks, health crises, natural disasters and other unforeseen events—that can unpredictably erode travel demand and disrupt our service delivery. We strive to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions by continuously reallocating resources to performance and brand advertising, innovating our desktop and mobile platforms, expanding and diversifying directly bookable accommodations, and employing hedging instruments to mitigate currency risk. We invest in redundant data‐center capacity, disaster‐recovery planning, system failovers, encryption and authentication protocols to uphold system integrity and operational continuity, while acknowledging residual vulnerabilities to cyberattacks, capacity constraints and third‐party service interruptions. Our dynamic transaction models—shifting between agency and merchant structures—and contract adaptations in response to competitive and regulatory pressures (including anti-trust investigations and parity-clause modifications) exemplify our commitment to reconfigure our value chain and legal frameworks so as to preserve or improve functioning despite adversity. Through ongoing risk assessment, strategic flexibility, global expansion, cross‐functional collaboration and compliance initiatives, we work to sustain performance, protect our reputation and foster resilience across our organizational structure.

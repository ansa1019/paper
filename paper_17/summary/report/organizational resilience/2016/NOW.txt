In our 10-K, we disclose that we continue to invest in our capacity to support anticipated growth, though these investments may not result in increased revenues or growth in our business, and that as cyber-security threats develop and grow, it may be necessary to make significant further investments to protect data and infrastructure. We acknowledge that our operations involve the storage, transmission and processing of sensitive customer information, that security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action or evolving attack techniques, and that a security breach or loss of data could result in a disruption to our service, litigation, regulatory investigations, government fines, reputational damage and other liabilities. We note that from time to time we experience defects in our services and that disruptions may result from errors in delivering, configuring or hosting our services, the use of third-party software, denial of service attacks or problems at co-located third-party data center facilities which are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss or similar events. Although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services, interrupt business continuity and result in substantial expense, with insurance coverage potentially insufficient to compensate us. We further recognize that natural disasters or other catastrophic events may harm our business operations, that operating in international markets requires significant investment and management attention and subjects us to diverse regulatory and economic risks, and that unforeseen operating expenses, complications, delays and unpredictable factors may adversely affect our ability to preserve or improve functioning under challenging conditions. Finally, we emphasize that our ability to remain competitive and maintain performance under pressure depends on our capacity to continuously enhance products to deliver consumer product-like experiences, mobility, messaging and ease of use, and to modify and improve our services in a timely manner to address evolving user expectations, standards, technologies and customer requirements.

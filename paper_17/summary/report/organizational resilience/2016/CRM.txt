The Company’s disclosures describe a multi-layered approach to preserving service delivery under adverse conditions by implementing security measures and contingency arrangements designed to “absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity,” including near‐real‐time replication of its production environment and customer data in a geographically separate facility as part of formal disaster recovery and business continuity programs. It acknowledges the potential for unauthorized access through breaches of its security measures or those of its third-party data center and cloud platform providers, the risk of system sabotage, defects or disruptions caused by hardware or software errors, and the possibility that actual or attempted denial-of-service attacks may impair customer access. The Company further recognizes its operational dependency on third-party hosting facilities—each vulnerable to earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, sabotage, vandalism, administrative or legal actions—and highlights that inadequate infrastructure capacity planning, unsuccessful data transfers during the addition of data centers, or interruptions in third-party services may lead to performance degradation, service outages, customer losses or financial liabilities. In addition, it identifies fragmentation of the internet, evolving privacy and cross-border data transfer regulations, and challenges in integrating acquired technologies into existing platforms as external pressures that could restrict its ability to reconfigure resources, maintain system integrity, adapt to unexpected situations or sustain core functionality and performance in the face of disruptive events.

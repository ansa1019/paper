Management acknowledges that “we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment” in which “new factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict the impact of all these factors on our business, financial condition or results of operations,” including adverse “economic conditions in the U.S. and international markets” that could reduce customer traffic and average transaction value, causing “sales de-leveraging” and downward pressure on margins. We emphasize the importance of preserving our brand and consumer trust—“we believe we have built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of our products, for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience and for our corporate social responsibility programs”—and recognize that “business incidents, whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us or our business partners, that erode consumer trust … can significantly reduce brand value.” To mitigate operational risks and support business continuity, “we continue to make significant investments in technology, third party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and to prevent or minimize breaches of our information technology systems or data loss,” and maintain “incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans” to preserve product availability, operational efficiency and financial results in the event of disruptions. We further seek to “effectively manage growth” through strategic initiatives—including “disciplined global expansion and introducing flexible and unique store formats,” “investing in our partners to deliver a superior customer experience,” and “driving convenience and brand engagement through our mobile, loyalty and digital capabilities”—while balancing “the need for flexibility and a degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with our goals, philosophy and standards.” We actively manage supply chain and commodity price risk—“we frequently enter into supply contracts … and … use hedging activities” to address “significant volatility” in coffee and dairy costs—and maintain cash and investment policies designed to “internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, make acquisitions, and return cash to shareholders,” reflecting our confidence that “future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and investments … will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses … for the foreseeable future.” We recognize, however, that “interruption of our supply chain could affect our ability to produce or deliver our products,” that “the loss of key personnel” and “failure to comply with applicable laws and changing legal and regulatory requirements” could harm our business, and that external pressures such as labor discord, natural disasters, geopolitical tensions and economic downturns require continuous adaptation to sustain organizational integrity and performance under adverse conditions.

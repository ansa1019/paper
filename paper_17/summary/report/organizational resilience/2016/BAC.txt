The annual report describes a formal enterprise risk framework and governance structure that underpins its organizational resilience, in which the board and senior management approve a risk appetite statement and capital and liquidity plans aligned with strategic objectives and risk capacity.  The corporation maintains diversified global liquidity sources, backup systems and other safeguards to support operations and growth; conducts regular stress testing, scenario analysis and backtesting of value-at-risk models; and deploys a robust “identify, measure, monitor and control” process to manage strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks across all legal entities.  It employs contingency funding plans, recovery and preferred single-point-of-entry resolution strategies with intercompany arrangements, and capital conservation buffers to ensure it can continue functioning under internal or external variations, disruptions or severe stress.  Mortgage servicing rights, interest rate lock commitments and other rate-sensitive assets are hedged with derivatives and high-quality liquid assets, and underwriting, concentration limits and hedging of credit exposures are used to absorb strain and preserve performance in adverse conditions.  Operational continuity is further supported by business continuity planning, cybersecurity measures, fraud mitigation, technology and data management processes, and periodic validation of models and controls, all designed to enable positive adjustment, maintain system integrity and sustain the firm’s capacity to serve customers during unexpected events.

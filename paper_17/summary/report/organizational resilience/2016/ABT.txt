Abbott’s disclosures describe a range of operational and financial measures designed to preserve its integrity and sustain performance under internal and external variations and disturbances, including substantial investments in information technology systems and ongoing monitoring to reduce the risk and impact of cyber attacks or other significant disruptions; the use of foreign-exchange hedges and active working capital management to mitigate volatility in currency and credit markets; maintenance of an investment-grade credit rating, large undrawn revolving credit facilities and bridge financing arrangements to ensure liquidity and business continuity during economic or acquisition-related challenges; strategic reconfiguration of its portfolio through acquisitions (such as St. Jude Medical) and divestitures (such as its vision care business) to diversify revenue streams, integrate complementary capabilities and emerge stronger from market and regulatory changes; compliance and risk-mitigation processes to address evolving healthcare regulations and potential product quality interruptions; and forward-looking research and development programs that allocate resources to replenish its pipeline, adapt to customer needs and capitalize on innovation—together reflecting Abbott’s ability to absorb strain, reconfigure resources and preserve or enhance functioning despite pressures, constraints and failures consistent with the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

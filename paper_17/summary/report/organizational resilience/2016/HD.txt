The company acknowledges that intense competitive pressures and the inability “to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape” could materially affect prices, margins and demand, and therefore it must “regularly assess and adjust our efforts to address changes in the competitive landscape.” It emphasizes the need “to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics; consumer preferences, expectations and needs; and unexpected weather conditions” while managing appropriate inventory levels and maintaining an excellent customer experience. Recognizing that customers now “routinely use technology and mobile devices to rapidly compare products and prices, determine real-time product availability and purchase products,” the company “must continually anticipate and adapt to these changes in the purchasing process” by implementing interconnected retail programs such as BOSS, BOPIS, BODFS and Direct Fulfillment, deploying its COM platform, redesigning its website, updating its mobile app and enabling a dynamic ETA feature for online orders. Through substantial investments in its supply chain and information technology systems, including Project Sync and its new Customer Order Management system, the company has sought “to streamline our operations to allow our associates to continue to provide high-quality service to our customers, while simplifying customer interaction and providing our customers with a more interconnected retail experience,” aiming to “significantly reduce our average lead time from supplier to shelf, reduce transportation expenses and improve inventory turns” and to “create an end-to-end solution that benefits all participants in our supply chain.” The company also maintains and “regularly review[s] and update[s] processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of data and to prevent data loss,” recognizing that “we and our third-party service providers and vendors must continually evaluate and adapt our respective systems and processes and overall security environment” to address evolving cybersecurity risks. Furthermore, it continually seeks to enhance its online properties, leverage merchandising assortment planning and pricing tools to better understand customer preferences and refine assortments by location, and balance productivity and efficiency through continuous operational improvement in stores and the supply chain, disciplined capital allocation, share repurchases and dividends, all reflecting an organizational focus on maintaining performance, operational flexibility and the ability to emerge stronger from challenging conditions.

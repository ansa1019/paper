The company’s disclosures acknowledge that “business interruption or failure of our information technology and communication systems may impair the availability of our products and services,” that “we do not have redundancy for all of our systems,” and that “our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities,” any of which “may materially harm our reputation and our operating results.”  It describes the need to “upgrade and expand our network security and other information systems as well as our high-availability capabilities,” to migrate “our applications and infrastructure to new data centers and to third-party hosted environments” in a manner that avoids “unplanned service disruptions or unforeseen increases in costs,” and to maintain “adequate service levels during peak periods” such as the January–April turboTax season to prevent “lost customers, additional refunds of customer charges, negative publicity and increased operating costs.”  The report further notes the vulnerability of its “operations, data centers, . . . systems, and other critical business operations” to “natural disasters, human error, malicious attacks, fire, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, . . . and other events beyond our control,” including its proximity to seismic faults without earthquake insurance, and it emphasizes ongoing investment in “privacy and security capabilities,” “fraud detection and prevention measures,” and collaboration “with the broader industry and government to protect our customers from fraud” arising from “criminals using stolen identity information.”  It also highlights reliance on “critical third-party partners” such as banks, credit unions, software and service providers, and notes that any “failure of third parties to provide acceptable and high quality products, services and technologies” or to update their offerings may lead to “disruption to our business operations and our customers,” diminished “competitive advantage,” and harm to “our financial results.”  The company further identifies the risk of “adverse macroeconomic developments” affecting customer demand, credit-card processing volumes, and small-business and consumer spending, and describes its maintenance of “cash, cash equivalents and investments,” unsecured revolvers and term loans, and board-authorized buybacks and dividends to “meet our seasonal working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, contractual obligations, debt service requirements and other liquidity requirements” for at least the next 12 months.  These measures—ranging from information-technology resilience, disaster recovery and peak-demand planning to fraud mitigation, third-party oversight, liquidity management, and ongoing strategic investment in technology, security, and compliance—collectively serve to absorb strain, preserve functioning under challenging conditions, and adapt operations to emerge stronger from disruptive events.

The report acknowledges that challenging market and economic conditions can materially affect its businesses by reducing investment values, impairing liquidity and fundraising, and necessitating rapid “adjustment under challenging conditions,” including “cut[ting] back or eliminat[ing] the use of certain services or service providers” or even “terminat[ing] the employment of a significant number of our personnel” to match cost with declining revenue. It describes how “turmoil in the global financial markets … can have a material and rapid impact” on valuations, how portfolio companies may face “adverse operating performance, decreased revenues, … difficulty in obtaining financing and increased funding costs,” and how negative market conditions could “result in a portfolio company entering bankruptcy proceedings,” all of which require resource reallocation and strategic response. The firm emphasizes the existence of disaster recovery and business continuity programs to limit harm from “breaches of our network security systems,” system failures or infrastructure disruptions at its New York City headquarters, while cautioning these measures “may not be sufficient to mitigate the harm” and that insurance “might only partially reimburse us for our losses.” It details the need to adapt to “new lines of businesses, … acquisitions of critical business partners, or other strategic initiatives,” which impose “increasing demands on or issues related to … integrating operational and management systems and controls,” and recognizes that proposed regulatory and tax reforms—such as changes to carried interest taxation—may force structural adjustments and the redeployment of capital. The report also highlights the firm’s reliance on its senior managing directors’ “efforts, skill, reputations and business contacts,” warning that loss of these key personnel could impair the ability to “raise additional funds” and maintain “assets under management,” and underscores the importance of “develop[ing] and implement[ing] the right processes and tools to manage our changing enterprise and maintain this culture” in order to preserve flexibility, continuity and performance under pressure.

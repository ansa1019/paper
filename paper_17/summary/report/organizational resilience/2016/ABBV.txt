AbbVie’s risk disclosures emphasize that a wide range of actualized risks and uncertainties—including patent expirations and intellectual property challenges, biosimilar and generic competition, cost‐containment and pricing pressures, legal and regulatory investigations or sanctions, manufacturing disruptions from equipment malfunctions, natural or man-made disasters, and reliance on single-source suppliers and major wholesale distributors—could materially and adversely affect its business continuity, financial condition and cash flows. In anticipation of and response to these potential disruptions, AbbVie describes its resilience strategies such as vigorously defending its patents and trademarks through litigation and administrative proceedings, carrying business interruption insurance, diversifying and validating alternative suppliers, investing in quality assurance and compliance programs, monitoring creditworthiness and inventory levels in its distribution channels, maintaining liquidity through cash flows, credit facilities and debt issuances, executing strategic acquisitions and collaborations while integrating and reconfiguring resources, allocating substantial funding to research and development pipelines, enhancing operational flexibility and risk mitigation controls, and sustaining supply-chain and information-technology systems—all measures that support its ability to preserve or improve functioning and adapt its operations under challenging, constrained or exceptional conditions.

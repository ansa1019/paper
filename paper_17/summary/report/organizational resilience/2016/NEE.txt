In their business planning and in the management of their operations, NEE and FPL must address the effects of regulation on their business and adapt to political, regulatory and economic environments that limit earnings and alter traditional cost‐recovery mechanisms. FPL’s use of derivative instruments in its risk management fuel procurement program could be subject to prudence challenges, and NEE and FPL use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures and forwards, to manage their commodity and financial market risks; however, if price movements significantly or persistently deviate from historical behavior, NEE’s and FPL’s risk management tools—including hedging and trading procedures, internal controls, management review processes, value‐at‐risk models and liquidity guidelines—may not protect against significant losses. The liquidity of regional energy markets is an important factor in NEE’s ability to manage operational risks, and disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the credit and capital markets could increase NEE’s cost of capital and affect its ability to fund liquidity needs, meet growth objectives and preserve operational continuity. To support operations under severe weather or natural disasters that can cause power outages, property damage and service interruptions, NEE and FPL maintain storm‐recovery funds, restricted decommissioning funds and extensive compliance and emergency management processes; however, the recovery of restoration costs is subject to regulatory approval and any disallowance could materially affect business continuity. The operation and maintenance of NEE’s and FPL’s electric generation, transmission, distribution, pipeline and information technology systems are subject to many operational risks—including outages, equipment breakdowns, fuel supply interruptions, cyber attacks and project development delays—which may result in lost revenues, increased expenses, liability to third parties or an inability to perform under contractual obligations. NEE invests in gas and oil producing and pipeline assets to diversify its portfolio but is exposed to fluctuating commodity prices that may lead to impairments, project delays or cancellations. The companies supplement these efforts with credit risk policies that include counterparty credit limits, collateral requirements, master netting agreements and guarantee arrangements to reduce the risk of nonperformance, but recognize that residual exposures to extreme events, regulatory changes or internal control failures may challenge their ability to maintain system integrity and preserve performance under adverse conditions.

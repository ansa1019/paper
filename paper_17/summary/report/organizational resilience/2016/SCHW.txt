The company has established a comprehensive risk management program—including a board-approved enterprise risk management framework, a global risk committee with functional subcommittees, defined risk appetite statements, and regular risk identification, measurement, monitoring and reporting—to enable the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions.  It maintains systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance with complex legal and regulatory requirements, to preserve operational continuity and market integrity, and to protect client assets.  Operational resilience is supported by business continuity and disaster-recovery plans featuring geographically dispersed facilities, backup and recovery infrastructure, routine testing and a geographically dispersed workforce.  Information security controls, including advanced monitoring systems, access limitations, internal authentication measures and incident management protocols, are designed to absorb cyber-attack strain and preserve performance.  The company conducts regular liquidity and capital stress testing under various scenarios; maintains diversified funding through client deposits, committed credit facilities, short- and long-term debt, and highly liquid buffers; and follows a capital contingency plan to ensure system integrity and performance maintenance in extreme conditions.  Investment in people, technology, contractual safeguards with third‐party providers, and legal and compliance reserves further enhance adaptability, risk mitigation, and the capacity to recover and reconfigure operations in response to internal or external disturbances.

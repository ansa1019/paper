The Company’s disclosures reflect multiple resilience-oriented measures intended to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions, including its transformation and process improvement initiatives to establish a more agile and efficient operating model and to reallocate resources to fund innovative pipeline and growth opportunities; significant investments in next-generation biomanufacturing capacity, including the Singapore facility, intended to reduce scale and cost while retaining a reliable, high-quality, compliant supply of medicines; reliance on primary distribution centers in Louisville and Breda and on third-party logistics providers to support operational continuity in the face of natural disasters, security threats or utility disruptions; rigorous risk assessments of sole-source and biologically derived raw materials and medical devices, along with diversification of manufacturing sites in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and in Thousand Oaks, California, to mitigate potential production failures, supply constraints, stock-outs or recalls that could follow interruptions to these critical facilities; hedging of interest rate, foreign currency and commodity exposures to address financial market volatility and to preserve liquidity under adverse capital market conditions; maintenance of multiple financing sources, including commercial paper and revolving credit facilities, to ensure access to capital; formal integration frameworks for acquisitions to manage cultural, procedural and logistical complexities and to avoid unanticipated costs or delays; continuous enhancement of information technology security and infrastructure to counter cyber-attacks and preserve data integrity; and proactive monitoring of legal, regulatory and market environments—including pricing pressures from third-party payers, global economic fluctuations and emerging market risks—to safeguard the firm’s ability to absorb strain, preserve functioning and reconfigure operational trajectories in response to disruptive events.

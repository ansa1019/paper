Nike’s disclosures describe a multifaceted approach to absorbing strain and preserving performance under challenging conditions, including ongoing investments in complex information systems and controls for demand and supply planning and inventory management to ensure business continuity despite interruptions or disruptions in data and IT systems; strategic initiatives to diversify distribution through wholesale, direct-to-consumer stores and e-commerce channels, supported by store expansion, comparable store sales tracking and rapid fulfillment capabilities, to maintain operational flexibility in response to rapidly changing consumer preferences and market volatility; a supply-chain focus on manufacturing efficiency, product design innovation, automation technologies, futures ordering and inventory controls to mitigate risk, reconfigure resources and improve speed to market under adverse conditions; a centralized foreign exchange risk management program that combines natural offsets, currency hedging and working capital efficiency to lessen the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows and financial results; continued emphasis on technical innovation, quality control, R&D committees and specialist networks to generate new products and sustain brand reputation as a competitive advantage; rigorous credit risk assessment, code-of-conduct enforcement and contractor oversight to guard against supplier non-compliance, product recalls, geopolitical, health or environmental crises; comprehensive risk mitigation planning across operational resources—including capital deployment, share repurchase and debt financing strategies, committed credit facilities, tax planning and liquidity reserves—to ensure sufficient financial resources in both nominal and extreme conditions; and robust governance processes, internal controls, disaster recovery and contingency plans designed to detect potential failures, adapt to emerging threats, recover from disruptive events and uphold Nike’s integrity, strength and performance under pressure.

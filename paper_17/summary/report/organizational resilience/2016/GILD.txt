Our Annual Report on Form 10-K describes a range of risks and mitigation strategies that collectively illustrate our efforts to preserve performance and system integrity under adversity, akin to organizational resilience. We outline our reliance on a diversified manufacturing network, including third-party and single-source suppliers, and the operational flexibility required to address capacity constraints, inspection findings, quality requirements and potential interruptions from natural disasters or geopolitical events. We discuss our use of forward and option contracts to hedge foreign-currency exposure, inventory management agreements with wholesalers, partnerships to ensure access in emerging markets, and contingency planning for legislative or regulatory changes—including potential compulsory licenses, reimbursement reforms and government payor exclusions—that could undermine resource allocation or market continuity. We emphasize our management of supply chain vulnerabilities through long-term purchase commitments, capital investments in facilities and technology, and active collaboration with regulatory authorities to counter counterfeiting and ensure product integrity. Our disclosures further address the uncertainty of clinical trial outcomes, the complexity of global approvals and the risk of litigation—from generic patent challenges to product liability claims and government investigations—that could impair our ability to deploy resources, sustain innovation pipelines or maintain continuity of care. Taken together, these disclosures reflect strategic foresight, risk assessment and adaptive response mechanisms designed to maintain positive adjustment and preserve or improve functioning in the face of ongoing operational, financial and external pressures.

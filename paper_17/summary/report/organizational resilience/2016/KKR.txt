While we attempt to mitigate known risks to the extent practicable, we cannot assure the success of those efforts and acknowledge that difficult market conditions can adversely affect our business by reducing the value or performance of investments and the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital; our operations and those of our portfolio companies are materially affected by global financial markets and economic events—including interest‐rate shifts, credit availability, inflation, currency exchange fluctuations, political uncertainty, trade barriers and commodity price volatility—and declines in equity, commodity or debt markets can force us to write down investments, impair returns and constrain exit opportunities; challenging market and economic conditions, including sector-specific disruptions, may reduce liquidity and diminish the pace at which our funds can realize value while also potentially affecting our competitive positioning; evolving regulations and heightened scrutiny can impose additional capital and compliance burdens, limit fundraising efforts, restrict certain financing or investment activities, and divert senior management’s attention from strategic initiatives; we rely heavily on sophisticated information systems, technology infrastructure and third-party service providers to process, evaluate and settle transactions in an efficient, accurate and timely manner, and any disaster, disruption or cyber-attack could materially impair our business-continuity or disaster-recovery capabilities and expose us to potential losses, liability or reputational harm; our operational risks include errors in trade execution, confirmation and accounting for complex transactions; and although we employ hedging strategies and derivative instruments to limit exposure to market movements, such activities cannot eliminate the risk of losses, as correlations between hedges and positions may vary and unanticipated market changes may render them ineffective, all of which may stress our capacity to maintain performance, reconfigure resources, ensure continuity under extreme conditions and emerge stronger from unforeseen or disruptive events.

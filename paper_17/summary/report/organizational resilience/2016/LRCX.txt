The company’s risk disclosures underscore that its resilience hinges on the ability to “adjust spending and other resources allocated to operating activities” in response to “rapid changes in demand” and variability across customer segments—conditions that “have a significant impact on our future performance” if it fails to maintain “adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems, procedures for training and managing our work force” and appropriately size its supply chain infrastructure in a timely manner. It continuously reassesses its strategic resource allocation choices and employs “cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams,” while still “invest[ing] in R&D and maintain[ing] extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities” to sustain competitive advantage under “internal or external variations and disturbances.” To mitigate risks from “natural or man-made disasters,” supply disruptions, and currency fluctuations, the company secures “alternative sources” of critical components, enters into hedging contracts, and implements “ISO 27001 compliant security procedures and emergency recovery processes” for its information systems, even as it recognizes these measures “cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe.” It further emphasizes the importance of attracting and retaining key employees through competitive compensation and a rewarding work environment, preserving liquidity and access to capital markets to “meet our expenses and debt obligations,” and managing acquisition integrations without undue “diversion of management’s attention away from other business concerns.” Collectively, these practices reflect a systemic approach to absorb strain, preserve operational integrity, and maintain performance despite volatility, constraints, and unforeseen adverse events.

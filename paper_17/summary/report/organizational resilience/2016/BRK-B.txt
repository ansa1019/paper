Berkshire’s disclosures reflect multiple resilience strategies, including a board‐approved succession plan that identifies and continually monitors capable subsidiary managers to succeed key personnel, a decentralized operating model that empowers competent management at the subsidiary level to allocate resources and adapt day-to-day operations, and ongoing efforts to recruit and retain qualified personnel to ensure continuity under unpredictable demand. The company has implemented business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis to mitigate cyber security and other operational risks and preserve system integrity. It maintains substantial liquidity and diversified funding sources—through revolving credit agreements, access to capital markets and significant cash and treasury bill holdings—to absorb financial variations and preserve operational continuity. Berkshire Hathaway’s insurance operations demonstrate resilience through disciplined underwriting and investment practices that assume risk while preserving underwriting capital and responding to regulatory and market changes, including periodic adjustments to cost structures and exposures. BNSF and Berkshire Hathaway Energy commit to significant, ongoing capital investments to maintain and improve infrastructure reliability and service performance under varying conditions, while utilities and energy businesses routinely adapt to evolving regulatory requirements and environmental pressures. Collectively, these measures constitute a system-level capacity to absorb strain, reconfigure resources in response to disturbances and maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.

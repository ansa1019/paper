Prologis has established system redundancy, robust security measures and a formal disaster recovery plan for its information technology systems to mitigate cyber‐security attacks, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication failures, thereby preserving operational continuity and minimizing interruptions to its business. Management continually reviews and enhances the design and effectiveness of its disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, recognizing that deficiencies could impair performance and competitive position. The company manages foreign currency and interest rate exposures through hedging arrangements, debt denominated in multiple currencies and derivative contracts, aiming to uphold financial flexibility and resource availability under volatile capital market conditions. Geographic diversification of its logistics portfolio, coupled with earthquake, hurricane and flood hazard insurance—or self‐insurance when commercially reasonable—serves to absorb environmental perturbations and extreme conditions while maintaining system integrity. Prologis adapts its organizational structure through acquisitions, dispositions and contributions of properties to unconsolidated co-investment ventures, aligning capital deployment with evolving market demands and generating liquidity from property sales, equity contributions and partnership distributions. It leverages technology investments and advanced data analysis to streamline its operations, achieve economies of scale and enhance decision making, while ongoing risk assessments address compliance with varied international regulations and potential liability exposures. Through active management of its owned and managed portfolio—monitoring metrics such as occupancy, rent growth on lease rollovers, development starts and stabilization yields—and by allocating resources for tenant improvements, leasing commissions and build-to-suit developments, Prologis reconfigures its assets and operational parameters to respond effectively to economic, regulatory and environmental disruptions, thereby aiming to preserve or improve overall functioning and performance.

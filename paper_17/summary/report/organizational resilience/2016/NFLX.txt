Our risk disclosures emphasize that our ability to continue to attract and retain members depends on our capacity to provide compelling content choices and a quality viewing experience and that failing to manage change and growth or the growing complexity of our streaming operations—including improving, refining or revising our systems and operational practices to scale reliably with anticipated membership and feature expansion—could adversely affect our business. We acknowledge that the long-term and largely fixed-cost nature of multi-year content commitments may limit our operating flexibility and constrain resource allocation when membership acquisition and retention do not meet expectations. We recognize that any significant disruption of or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third-party providers, including cybersecurity breaches or interruptions in cloud computing services such as Amazon Web Services, could degrade service, result in loss of memberships and harm our reputation, underscoring the importance of resilient infrastructure and risk mitigation systems. We further note that changes in government regulations, net neutrality rules, network operator practices, privacy laws, payment processing requirements or intellectual property licensing terms may require alterations to our business model, incur additional expenses or impair access to content and consumer data, potentially impacting our ability to adapt to environmental disruptions. Additionally, we must continually add new memberships to replace cancellations and grow our base, manage original content production costs, marketing expenses and personnel-related investments, and maintain cash flow and capital resources—including debt service obligations and our global content delivery network—as critical factors in preserving operational continuity and financial resilience amid competitive, regulatory and technological challenges.

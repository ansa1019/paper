The Company acknowledges that it must absorb strain and preserve its integrity and performance under internal or external pressures, and it therefore operates a multifaceted resilience framework encompassing disciplined underwriting, risk modeling, and the purchase of third-party reinsurance, combined with geographic diversification, to control exposures to natural catastrophes, terrorism, cyber-attack and other extreme events.  It maintains actuarially determined loss and loss expense reserves, continuously evaluated by claims and actuarial personnel, and holds a portfolio of short-duration, high-quality fixed income securities, supplemented by short-term investments, cash pooling arrangements and repurchase agreements, so that premiums collected and investment income less policy benefits and claims payments generate sufficient liquidity to meet unforeseen demands.  A $1.5 billion unsecured credit facility, syndicated letters of credit and collateral agreements with cedants support operational continuity and risk mitigation.  Administrative and technical controls, contingency protocols and third-party service agreements safeguard against security breaches, system failures and infrastructure disruptions, while an integrated catastrophe management program, supported by analytical modeling, probabilistic event simulations and hedging of property, casualty and guarantee exposures, enables the Company to reconstitute response trajectories and reconfigure its capital and reinsurance structures promptly following disruptive events.  The Companyâ€™s profit-center structure and acquisition integration process focus on preserving and enhancing combined profitability through cross-functional synergies, cost savings and resource reallocation, thereby helping it maintain positive adjustment and emerge stronger from challenging conditions.

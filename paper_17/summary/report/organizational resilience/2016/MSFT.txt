“Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock, and accordingly we are undertaking cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation. Besides software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services, and we emphasize that our success in cloud-based services depends on our execution in several areas—including continuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based experiences, maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based services, ensuring they meet reliability and data security expectations, and making our suite of cloud-based services platform-agnostic—each of which is essential to preserving or improving our performance under pressure. We caution that if we are not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we may not grow revenue in line with our infrastructure and development investments, which may negatively impact operating margins and income. Developing new technologies is complex, requiring long development and testing periods, and significant delays in new releases could adversely affect our revenue. Acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances involve risks in integrating new employees, systems, and technology, and it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits—smaller or slower-to-materialize benefits could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition. We review our amortizable intangible assets and goodwill for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying values may not be recoverable. To defend against constantly evolving cyber-threats, we must continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security and reliability features, improve software update deployment, develop mitigation technologies, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects our network, products, and services, and provide customers with security tools; the cost of these steps could reduce operating margins, and any failure to maintain security could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases or use competing products or services. We may also experience outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure, as increasing user traffic and service complexity demand more computing power, and maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex, requiring robust and reliable connectivity within evolving competitive and regulatory constraints; inefficiencies or operational failures could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience, resulting in contractual liability, customer claims, reputational damage, and harm to our operating results and financial condition. Providing more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and the strength of our business continuity management plans, and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages on our operating results. We further recognize that catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions—such as major earthquakes, weather events, cyber-attacks, terrorist attacks, or other disruptive events—could disrupt critical systems and operations, causing delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other essential functions. In the management’s discussion and analysis, we underline that much of our focus in fiscal year 2016 was toward transforming the organization to support our strategy of building best-in-class platforms and productivity services for a mobile-first, cloud-first world; we achieved product development milestones, implemented organizational changes, and made strategic and tactical moves to support our ambitions of reinventing productivity and business processes, building the intelligent cloud platform, and creating more personal computing. We operate in a dynamic, highly competitive industry with frequent technology and business-model shifts, each representing both risk and opportunity, and we rely on a broad range of research and development activities to identify and address changing customer demands, industry trends, and competitive forces in order to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions.”

Risk factors explicitly identify the potential for supply chain disruptions—from natural or man-made disasters, acts of war or terrorism, facility shutdowns for quality or regulatory reasons, or the loss of key molecules or intermediaries—to negatively impact our product development cycle, business continuity and operational results. We rely on sole-source or single-source suppliers and other third parties for manufacturing, distribution, IT systems, clinical research and commercialization services, and the failure of any critical third party to perform, comply with regulations, maintain confidentiality or adequately deploy business continuity plans in a crisis could have a material adverse impact on our operations and results. We depend extensively on information technology systems, networks and third-party data hosting, and while we have invested in industry-appropriate protections and monitoring practices, there can be no assurance our efforts will prevent significant breakdowns, cyber-attacks, data leakage or reputational damage which could halt operations, impair our financial condition or disrupt continuity. In October 2016, we announced an evolution to our operating model designed to focus commercial and R&D resources on key brands and markets, streamline administrative functions, realign biologics manufacturing capabilities and create a more agile R&D organization, thereby delivering the strategic, financial and operational flexibility necessary to invest in our highest priorities and sustain performance under challenging or unexpected conditions. Our governance processes include formal review and certification of financial reporting, oversight of inventory levels in the distribution channel to limit sales to expected demand, and escalation procedures to address potential compliance issues, all of which serve to bolster our ability to maintain functioning and preserve integrity under internal or external pressures.

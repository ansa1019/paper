The company discloses that global and regional economic conditions, uncertainty about macroeconomic factors, currency fluctuations, fuel and energy cost changes and volatility in financial markets could materially adversely affect demand for its products and services and that, in the event of financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets, tightening credit markets, low liquidity and extreme volatility could cause supplier insolvencies, outsourcing partner disruptions, product delays, customer credit constraints, counterparty failures and restrictions on issuing new debt. It depends on sole-sourced and limited outsourcing partners for critical components, final assembly and logistics, reducing direct control over production and distribution and limiting flexibility to respond to changing conditions. The company must order components and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments based on projected demand in markets that are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technological and price changes, exposing it to forecasting errors, excess or insufficient inventory, unutilized purchase commitments and cancellation fee accruals. The company regularly reviews inventory and manufacturing-related assets held at suppliers’ facilities and prepayments for obsolescence, impairment and recoverability and records write-downs or impairment losses when carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Given the highly volatile and competitive nature of its industries, the company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing offerings, stimulate customer demand and successfully manage product transitions. Information technology system failures, network disruptions or natural and man-made disasters—including acts of terrorism, war, cyberattacks, industrial accidents, public health crises, pandemics and climate-related events—may render system redundancy ineffective and disaster recovery planning insufficient, prevent access to online stores and services, preclude retail transactions, compromise data and impede manufacturing, logistics, service delivery, transaction processing and financial reporting. The company’s operations are subject to interruption by war, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, natural disasters, labor disputes and other events beyond its control, which could decrease demand, impair production and delivery and create inefficiencies in its supply chain. While the company maintains policies, procedures, network security, data encryption, insurance coverage and hedging strategies to manage these risks, no assurance can be given that such measures will fully mitigate the impacts of these adverse events on its business continuity, operational flexibility and ability to maintain performance under pressure.

Our annual report describes an operational risk framework that emphasizes business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities in our transaction processing operations, noting that an operational failure could impair service delivery, damage client relationships and cause data loss or reputational harm; similarly, we maintain a robust information security and controls program to protect the integrity, continuity, security and trust of our systems and those of our clients against unauthorized intrusions, malware, network disruptions and evolving cyber threats, acknowledging the need for ongoing investments in risk assessment and mitigation to preserve performance under adverse conditions; we further highlight the imperative to adapt our products and services to technological and market changes, manage resource allocation for technological upgrades, pursue innovation initiatives and execute operational effectiveness and active portfolio management programs to capture economies of scale, achieve scale efficiencies and integrate acquired businesses, thereby enabling reconfiguration of assets, absorption of external variations and maintenance of performance under competitive and regulatory pressures; finally, our liquidity and capital resources strategy, including cash flow generation and committed revolving credit and term facilities, provides the financial flexibility to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and strategic initiatives and to sustain operations across nominal, extreme or exceptional conditions.

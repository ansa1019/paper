To preserve operations and maintain performance under internal or external disturbances, we have backup systems and business continuity plans in place to safeguard against system failures or penetration attempts, and we monitor and adapt to economic, political, regulatory or natural developments that could disrupt our supply chain, manufacturing capabilities or distribution channels. We allocate resources and adjust pricing, geographic and product mix to mitigate the adverse effects of currency fluctuations, significant tax increases and competitive pressures, actions to recover margins sometimes resulting in lower volume or a weaker competitive position. Our strategic priorities encompass the development and commercialization of reduced-risk products, rigorously managed and substantiated through scientific studies, as well as the flexibility to replace third-party contract manufacturers or service providers with our own resources if required. We employ rigorous control and compliance procedures, contingency planning and stakeholder engagement to manage litigation, contraband, regulatory investigations and other risks, and we pursue selective acquisitions, market entry and brand portfolio initiatives to sustain growth, operational flexibility and organizational resilience in dynamic, challenging environments.

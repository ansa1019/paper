Nike relies significantly on information technology to operate its business, including supply chain and retail operations, and any failure, inadequacy, or interruption of that technology could harm its ability to effectively operate. The company is heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks across its supply chain, including product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales and distribution, as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes. Information technology systems are critical to many of Nike's operating activities and business processes and may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown. The ability to effectively manage and maintain inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these information technology systems. Nike has implemented information technology systems in all geographical regions in which it operates, and the work to integrate, secure, and enhance these systems and related processes in global operations is ongoing, with continued investment in these efforts. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, including as a result of security breaches, viruses, hackers, malware, natural disasters, vendor business interruptions, or other causes, could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of operations, requiring significant capital investments to remediate problems, and may adversely affect reputation, results of operations, and financial condition. The company also uses information technology systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal, and tax requirements. If information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption, or shutdown and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve issues in a timely manner, there could be delays in reporting financial results, resulting in lost revenues and profits, as well as reputational damage. Nike's digital commerce operations are increasingly reliant on effective information technology systems, and any failure to provide attractive, effective, reliable, user-friendly digital commerce platforms that meet the changing expectations of online shoppers could place the company at a competitive disadvantage. The company's ability to engage in electronic communications throughout the world between and among employees and with other third parties, including customers, suppliers, vendors, and consumers, is also dependent on information technology systems. Any interruption in these systems may impede the ability to engage in the digital space and result in lost revenues, damage to reputation, and loss of users. The company faces risks associated with managing its information technology systems, including the potential for interruptions that could adversely impact business operations and financial performance. Nike's commitment to investing in technology capabilities is essential to maintaining competitive advantage and operational efficiency, particularly in a rapidly evolving marketplace characterized by shifts in consumer behavior and preferences.

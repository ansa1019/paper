The company's ability to effectively support business needs through IT capability has become a key factor in transforming it into a competitive force. We rely extensively on IT/OT systems, networks, and services, including internet and intranet sites, data hosting and processing facilities, and technologies, to assist in conducting our business. These systems are utilized for various functions, including shipping products to customers, marketing and selling products to consumers, and managing banking and cash liquidity systems. The effectiveness of our IT capability is crucial for operational efficiency and organizational effectiveness, as it encompasses the coordination of a firmâ€™s assets and internal processes. Our IT/OT risk management program, supervised by IT management, regularly assesses emerging cybersecurity threats and the company's strategies to address them. Despite our policies and procedures, we may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to which we are exposed. The evolving nature of cybersecurity threats poses risks to the security of our services and the integrity of our data. We continuously invest in enhancing our IT infrastructure, including ongoing monitoring and updating of networks and systems, to address these threats. The integration of digital technologies into our operations is essential for maintaining competitiveness in a rapidly changing market environment. Our ability to innovate and respond to competitive factors, including emerging retail trends and consumer preferences, is dependent on our IT capabilities. The success of our innovation initiatives relies on our capacity to leverage technology advancements and consumer insights, which are integral to product improvements and marketing strategies. We must also effectively manage relationships with third-party partners, which involves a lesser degree of control over business operations and increases operational risk. The company's financial performance is influenced by its ability to manage IT resources effectively, as disruptions in IT systems can lead to operational outages and negatively impact business continuity. Our strategic focus on productivity improvement and cost savings includes leveraging IT capabilities to streamline management decision-making and enhance operational processes. Additionally, our organizational structure supports the deployment of IT resources across global business units, enabling us to respond swiftly to market dynamics and consumer demands. The ongoing assessment of our IT architecture and capabilities is critical for maintaining our competitive positioning and achieving long-term business objectives. As we navigate the complexities of global markets, our IT capabilities will play a pivotal role in resource allocation, investment decisions, and ultimately, in driving business value and performance outcomes.

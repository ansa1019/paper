Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk, and our business could be harmed by various factors, including our ability to attract new customers and retain existing ones. We have recently introduced products in the markets for IT operations management, customer service, security operations, and HR service management, which are important to our revenue growth prospects. Our successful entry into these new markets depends on several factors, including the degree of differentiation of our products from those offered by established competitors, the compelling benefits and value our products offer to customers, and the effectiveness of our research and development efforts. We may not have the necessary resources, including employees with the required product management, engineering, marketing, and sales expertise, to compete effectively in these new markets. Furthermore, our operations involve the storage, transmission, and processing of our customers' confidential information, and any cyber-security event could result in significant liabilities and harm our business. We have security measures in place designed to protect customer information; however, these measures may not be sufficient to prevent breaches. Disruptions or defects in our services could damage our customers' businesses and harm our reputation. We also face competition from large, well-established vendors and emerging cloud vendors, and our ability to compete effectively is critical to our business performance. Our competitors may respond more quickly to new opportunities and customer requirements, which could impact our market positioning. We continue to invest in the development of our services, infrastructure, and sales and marketing to drive long-term growth. Our subscription revenues are primarily derived from fees that give customers access to our ordered subscription service, related support, and updates during the subscription term. We recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract term, and our contracts are generally non-cancelable during this period. Our ability to enhance our products and services to deliver consumer product-like experiences is essential for attracting new customers and increasing revenues from existing customers. We believe that enterprises are increasingly focused on delivering a consumer product-like technology experience to users within the enterprise. Our success depends on our ability to continuously enhance our products and services and provide them in ways that are broadly accepted. We have made substantial investments in data centers and cloud computing infrastructure to support our growth and expansion into new geographic markets. Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenues, and we expect to continue to see growth in this area. However, we face various risks associated with international sales, including compliance with governmental laws and regulations, foreign currency fluctuations, and the need to localize our services. Our management's discussion and analysis includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, and we must carefully consider these factors as they could materially affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our business, financial condition, liquidity, or operating results could be materially adversely affected by risks related to our business and the wireless industry, including the need to acquire additional spectrum to continue customer growth and expand coverage. The ability to attract additional customers and provide services depends on our capability to implement our plans and improve our network, which may be impacted by competition, industry consolidation, and changes in the market for wireless services. We face competition from multiple wireless competitors, some of which have greater resources, and this rivalry could negatively affect our ability to attract and retain customers. Our ability to compete will depend on continued improvement in network quality and customer services, effective marketing, and cost management, all of which involve significant expenses. The introduction of new technologies and the need to adapt to technological changes are crucial for our growth and competitiveness. Failure to take advantage of technological developments may lead to a decline in demand for our services. Significant technological changes continue to impact the communications industry, requiring us to continually invest in our network and enhance our offerings to meet changing customer demands. We rely on our IT systems as an important part of our internal controls to operate and manage our business effectively. Failure to maintain effective internal controls, including those over our IT systems, could result in inaccurate financial statements and disclosures. Cybersecurity threats pose risks to our operations, as unauthorized access to our systems could disrupt services and compromise customer information. We are implementing a new billing system that may cause operational disruptions or delays, which could adversely affect our ability to provide services and retain customers. Our reliance on third-party vendors for critical services, including billing and network infrastructure, introduces risks that could adversely affect our business if these vendors fail to perform adequately. Our ability to manage and deploy IT resources effectively is essential for enhancing our operational efficiency and achieving business objectives. The management of our IT capabilities, including data management and information processing, is critical to supporting our business strategies and operational needs. We must continually evaluate and adapt our systems and processes to address the evolving threat landscape and ensure the reliability and security of our information technology infrastructure. Our financial performance may be impaired if we experience high fraud rates related to device financing and subscriptions, which underscores the importance of effective IT governance and management practices. The ongoing transformation of our business, including the integration of new technologies and processes, is essential for maintaining competitive advantage and achieving operational excellence. We are committed to leveraging our IT capabilities to enhance customer value, improve service delivery, and drive business innovation.

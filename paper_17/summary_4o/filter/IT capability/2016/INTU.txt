This annual report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements regarding our expectations and beliefs about the future conduct and growth of the business, including our intention to invest significant management attention and resources in our information technology infrastructure and in our privacy and security capabilities. We face intense competitive pressures that may harm our operating results, as competition remains intense across all our businesses. Our ability to adapt to technological change and global trends in customer access to software offerings is crucial for future revenue growth. As we transition to more connected services, the ongoing operation and availability of our information technology and communication systems, including those of our external service providers, is increasingly important. Business interruption or failure of our information technology systems may impair the availability of our products and services, potentially damaging our reputation and future financial results. We are continually investing resources to update and improve our internal information technology systems and software platforms to meet the growing and changing requirements of our business and customers. Our reliance on third-party vendors to host sensitive and personal information and data necessitates robust security measures to protect against unauthorized access and data breaches. We are investing significant resources in our information technology infrastructure to enhance our capabilities and ensure the protection of customer data, which is critical in the face of increasing fraudulent activities. Our growth strategy depends on our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new markets, and to drive broad adoption of the products and services we develop and market. The complexity of our products and the condensed development cycles increase the risk of errors and launch delays, which could harm our revenue and reputation. We are also in the process of updating our customer-facing applications and the supporting information technology infrastructure to meet customer expectations for continuous service availability. Our business operations are vulnerable to interruptions from various external factors, including natural disasters and cyber-attacks, which could significantly harm our business and financial condition. We must continue to develop our skills, tools, and capabilities to capitalize on existing and emerging technologies, which require significant resource allocation. Our future financial results may be materially harmed if we do not execute the transition to new environments effectively, as unplanned service disruptions could arise from difficulties in upgrading our systems. Additionally, we are subject to various legal proceedings and regulatory inquiries that may adversely affect our business and financial results. We regularly invest resources to update and improve our internal information technology systems and software platforms, as these systems are essential for our development, marketing, operational, support, sales, accounting, and financial reporting activities. Our ability to effectively manage our systems and processes is critical to ensuring that transactions are handled appropriately, and we must combat increasing fraudulent activities that may adversely impact our consumer tax, payroll, and payments businesses.

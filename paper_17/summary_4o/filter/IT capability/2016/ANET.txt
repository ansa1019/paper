Our business and operations have experienced rapid growth, and if we do not appropriately manage any future growth or are unable to improve our systems and processes, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects will be adversely affected. We must continue to improve our operational, financial, and management controls and our reporting processes and procedures and implement more extensive and integrated financial and business information systems. We may not be able to successfully implement these or other improvements to our systems and processes in an efficient or timely manner, and we may discover deficiencies in their capabilities or effectiveness. Our failure to improve our systems and processes, or their failure to operate effectively and in the intended manner, may result in disruption of our current operations and end-customer relationships. Our success will depend in part upon our ability to manage our growth effectively. We must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and continue to hire, train, and manage new employees as needed. The cloud networking market can be characterized by rapid technological shifts and increasingly complex end-customer requirements to achieve scalable and more programmable networks that facilitate virtualization, big data, public/private cloud, and web scale computing. We must continue to develop new technologies and products that address emerging technological trends and changing end-customer needs. Our ability to compete will depend upon our ability to provide a better solution than our competitors at a more competitive price. We expect to continue to invest heavily in software development in order to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform, introduce new products, and build upon our technology leadership. We believe one of our greatest strengths lies in the speed of our product development efforts. We expect our results of operations will be impacted by the timing and size of these investments. Our revenue growth rate in recent periods may not be indicative of our future performance. Our revenue growth rate in recent periods may not be indicative of our future performance. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by rapidly growing companies in constantly evolving industries, including the risks described elsewhere in this annual report. Our business depends on the overall demand for information technology, network connectivity, and access to data and applications. Weak domestic or global economic conditions, fear or anticipation of such conditions, or a reduction in information technology and network infrastructure spending could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. We have experienced annual revenue growth rates of 34.8%, 43.4%, and 61.7% in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. We believe that our cloud networking platform addresses the large and growing cloud networking segment of data center switching, which remains in the early stage of adoption. Our ability to sustain our revenue growth will depend, in part, upon our continued sales of more robust configurations, and quarterly results of operations can be significantly impacted by the mix of products and product configurations sold during the period. Our products must interoperate with operating systems, software applications, and hardware developed by others, and if we are unable to devote the necessary resources to ensure that our products interoperate with such software and hardware, we may lose or fail to increase market share and experience a weakening demand for our products. We rely on the availability of licenses to third-party software and other intellectual property, and the inability to obtain or maintain certain licenses or other rights could result in delays in releases of products and services and could otherwise disrupt our business. Our products contain software modules licensed to us by third-party authors under open source licenses, and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products.

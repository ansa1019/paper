Nike relies significantly on information technology to operate its business, including its supply chain and retail operations, and any failure, inadequacy, or interruption of that technology could harm its ability to effectively operate. The company is heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks across its supply chain, including product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales, and distribution, as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes. Any significant failure in these systems could result in adverse effects on business operations. Nike has implemented information technology systems in all geographical regions where it operates, and the integration, security, and enhancement of these systems is an ongoing effort that requires continued investment. The company’s ability to effectively manage and maintain inventory and ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these information technology systems. Additionally, Nike’s digital capabilities are crucial for engaging with consumers and enhancing their shopping experience through e-commerce platforms. The company acknowledges that any failure to provide attractive, effective, reliable, user-friendly e-commerce platforms could place it at a competitive disadvantage, potentially resulting in lost revenues and damage to its reputation. Moreover, Nike's commitment to investments in operational infrastructure and consumer-focused digital capabilities reflects its strategic alignment with technological advancements to drive growth and operational excellence. The company recognizes the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging other resources and capabilities to support business strategies and enhance performance. Challenges related to the implementation, operation, and maintenance of increasingly complex information systems and controls, including those related to demand and supply planning and inventory control, are acknowledged as significant risks. Nike's ongoing investments in technology aim to optimize efficiency and effectiveness in operations, which are essential for sustaining competitive advantage in a rapidly changing market environment. The company also emphasizes the need for effective management of its information technology resources to ensure compliance with regulatory standards and to protect sensitive business and consumer data. The reliance on information technology extends to its digital marketing, digital commerce, and consumer engagement strategies, highlighting the integral role of IT capabilities in supporting Nike's overall business objectives and performance outcomes.

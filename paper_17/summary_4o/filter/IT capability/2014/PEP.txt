Our business depends on information technology, including public websites and cloud-based services, for many activities important to our operations, including to interface with our customers and consumers, to engage in digital marketing activities, to enable and improve the effectiveness of our operations, to order and manage materials from suppliers, to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency, to comply with regulatory, financial reporting, legal and tax requirements, to collect and store sensitive data and confidential information, and to communicate electronically among our global operations and with our employees and the employees of our independent bottlers, contract manufacturers, joint ventures, suppliers, and other third parties. We are regularly subject to cyberattacks, and such attempts are occurring more frequently, evolving in nature, and becoming more sophisticated. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain our information technology infrastructure, if we fail to timely identify or appropriately respond to cybersecurity incidents, or if our information systems are damaged, destroyed, or shut down, our business could be disrupted, leading to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, loss of customers and revenues, damage to our reputation, litigation, regulatory enforcement actions, and violation of data privacy, security, or other laws and regulations. We have entered into agreements with third-party service providers to share certain information technology support services and administrative functions, and we utilize cloud-based services and systems managed by third-party vendors to process, transmit, and store information and to conduct certain of our business activities and transactions. If any of these third-party service providers or vendors do not perform effectively, or if we fail to adequately monitor their performance, we may not achieve the expected cost savings and may incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers. Our multi-year business transformation initiative aims to migrate certain of our systems, including our financial processing systems, to enterprise-wide systems solutions. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper information technology infrastructure, or if we fail to achieve the expected benefits from this initiative, it may impact our ability to process transactions accurately and efficiently and remain in step with the changing needs of the trade. Our ability to capitalize on our cost reduction efforts and our global operating model will require certain investments in our business, which may be limited due to capital constraints. We are focused on increasing automation in our operations to reduce costs and increase capacity, expanding shared services, restructuring our manufacturing operations to optimize our assets and capabilities globally, and increasing organizational effectiveness and efficiencies through the ongoing evolution of our operating model. Our productivity initiatives are designed to drive innovation globally and help fund our growth initiatives while contributing to our results of operations. We are also continuing to implement our global operating model to improve efficiency, decision-making, innovation, and brand management across the global organization to enable us to compete effectively. Our continued success depends on our ability to anticipate and effectively respond to shifts in consumer trends, including increased demand for products that meet the needs of consumers who are concerned with health and wellness, convenience, and location of origin or source of the products they consume.

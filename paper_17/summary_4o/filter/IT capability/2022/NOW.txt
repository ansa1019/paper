Investing in our securities involves risks, including our ability to grow our business, which may be impacted by laws, regulations, and customer expectations regarding the use, storage, and movement of data. We participate in intensely competitive markets, and if we do not compete effectively, our business and operating results will be harmed. If we fail to innovate in response to rapidly evolving technological and market developments and customer needs, our competitive position and business prospects may be harmed. As we acquire or invest in companies and technologies, we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits, and the acquisitions and investments may divert our management's attention. Our reliance on a network of partners for an increasing portion of our revenues means that if these partners fail to perform, our ability to sell and distribute our products may be impacted. If we or our third-party service providers experience a cybersecurity event, our platform may be perceived as not being secure, leading to customer loss or significant liabilities. Our operations involve the storage, transmission, and processing of sensitive data, which may include personally identifiable information. We have security measures and a data governance framework in place designed to protect customer information, but these mechanisms may not be effective at preventing breaches. The frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks have increased, and we may continue to be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. We must identify and innovate in the right emerging technologies and keep pace with rapidly changing technological developments to compete effectively. Our customers increasingly evaluate their purchases based on the advantages of digital technologies and their need to shift to modern cloud-based infrastructure. The pace of innovation will continue to accelerate, and we must invest in and continually optimize our technology platform to meet high-performance expectations. We also need to effectively secure our platform and customers' data and deliver the digital transformation process planning and IT systems architecture planning that our customers require. Our business depends on our platform being available without disruption, and we experience defects, disruptions, outages, and other performance problems. Disruptions in service can result from errors in developing, delivering, or hosting our services. We have made significant investments in data centers and cloud computing infrastructure to support our operations and customer needs. Our subscription revenues are primarily derived from fees that give customers access to our subscription service, and we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract term. As we continue to grow, we expect our revenue growth rate to decline over the long term due to increasing competition and other factors. Our operating results may vary significantly from period to period, and we may fail to meet financial performance expectations. We expect to continue to grow our business and generate positive cash flows from operations, which are essential for funding our operations and growth. Our ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers is critical to our success, and we must effectively manage our sales cycles and sales to larger enterprise customers. Our success depends on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand under various intellectual property protections, and we may face challenges related to compliance with laws and regulations impacting our services.

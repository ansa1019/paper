The industries that Applied serves can be volatile and difficult to predict, with demand for manufacturing equipment and services changing depending on several factors, including technology inflections and advances in fabrication processes. Applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity across its businesses, which may incur unexpected costs to align its operations. During periods of increasing demand, Applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand, effectively manage its supply chain, and continue to control costs. The company is exposed to risks associated with an uncertain global economy, which could materially impact its operating results. Changes in consumer demand can lead to shortages of parts and materials, straining manufacturing capacity and impacting revenues. Applied's business performance and results of operations may be adversely affected if it does not effectively manage these challenges during periods of changing demand. The company must continue to invest in research and development to support its customers, which can negatively impact operating margins. The global nature of Applied’s operations subjects it to various risks, including trade issues, political instability, and regulatory changes, which could impair its ability to manage operations and deliver products. Applied's customer base is highly concentrated, and the actions of a single customer can expose the company to greater volatility. The company’s ability to accurately forecast and allocate resources towards addressing key technology changes is critical for its business performance. Applied's strategic priorities include developing products that solve customer challenges at technology inflections and expanding served market opportunities. The company must maintain operating flexibility to respond to changing markets and customer requirements, enhance its operations to reduce cycle time and improve quality, and effectively allocate resources between existing products and new product development. Applied's success depends on its ability to attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees with necessary expertise, as fluctuations in global economic conditions and competition for talent can impact its capabilities. The implementation of new enterprise resource planning and information systems is essential for managing business operations and aligning global organizations, and any failure in this regard could result in operational difficulties and adversely affect business performance. Applied is also exposed to cybersecurity risks as it collects, uses, and stores data on its information technology systems, which are subject to disruption and breaches. The company must devote significant resources to network security and data protection measures to mitigate these risks. Overall, the ability to effectively manage technology resources and capabilities, including investments in IT infrastructure, is crucial for Applied to maintain its competitive advantage and achieve its strategic objectives.

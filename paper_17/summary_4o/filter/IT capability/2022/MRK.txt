The company is increasingly dependent on sophisticated software applications and computing infrastructure. The company could be a target of future cyber-attacks that could lead to a disruption of its worldwide operations, including manufacturing, research, and sales operations. The company is increasingly dependent on sophisticated software applications, complex information technology systems, computing infrastructure, and cloud service providers to conduct critical operations. Certain of these systems are managed, hosted, provided, or used by third parties to assist in conducting the company's business. Disruption, degradation, or manipulation of these IT systems through intentional or accidental means by the company's employees, third parties with authorized access, or unauthorized third parties could adversely affect key business processes. Cyber-attacks against the company's IT systems or third-party providers' IT systems, such as cloud-based systems, could result in exposure of confidential information, the modification of critical data, and/or the failure of critical operations. The company continues to leverage new and innovative technologies across the enterprise to replace outmoded technology and improve the efficacy and efficiency of its business processes, including data acquisition; the use of which can create new risks. The company monitors its data, information technology, and personnel usage of company IT systems to reduce these risks and continues to do so on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats. There can be no assurance that the company's efforts to protect its data and IT systems or the efforts of third-party providers to protect their IT systems will be successful in preventing disruptions to the company's operations, including its manufacturing, research, and sales operations. Such disruptions have in the past and could in the future result in loss of revenue, or the loss of critical or sensitive information from the company's or the company's third-party providers' databases or IT systems and have in the past and could in the future also result in financial, legal, business, or reputational harm to the company and substantial remediation costs. The company is also reliant on third-party relationships and outsourcing arrangements for key aspects of its business, including support for its information technology systems. Failure of these third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, and other obligations to the company or the development of factors that materially disrupt the relationships between the company and these third parties could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. The company continues to invest in its IT infrastructure to enhance operational efficiency and support its strategic goals. The company recognizes that effective IT governance is critical to managing risks associated with technology deployment and ensuring the reliability and security of its information systems. The company’s IT capabilities are integral to its ability to respond to market dynamics and maintain competitive advantage in the pharmaceutical industry. The company’s reliance on advanced IT systems underscores the importance of aligning technology resources with business strategies to optimize performance and drive innovation. The company continues to evaluate and enhance its IT architecture to support its evolving business needs and improve overall organizational effectiveness.

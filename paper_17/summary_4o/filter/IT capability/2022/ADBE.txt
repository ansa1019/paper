Our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements, and our ability to grow our business is influenced by the intensely competitive markets in which we participate. If we cannot continue to develop, acquire, market, and offer new products and services or enhancements that meet customer requirements, our operating results could suffer. The markets for our products and services are characterized by intense competition, new industry standards, evolving distribution models, and new technology developments. Our future success will depend on our ability to enhance and integrate our existing products and services, introduce new offerings in a timely and cost-effective manner, and meet changing customer expectations. The introduction of new technology could harm our business if we fail to adapt our products accordingly. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future investments or acquisitions, and the integration of acquisitions may disrupt our business and management. Our ability to acquire other businesses or technologies may also be impaired by external influences such as the COVID-19 pandemic and trade tensions. The success of our product offerings depends on our ability to attract and retain customers, and we rely on the functionality and features of our online marketplaces to do so. Our brands significantly contribute to our business success, and maintaining and enhancing them may require substantial investments. Security breaches in data centers we manage could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of employee and customer data, exposing us to liability and adversely affecting our reputation. We continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to mitigate risks to our data and systems. Cyber threats are evolving and increasingly sophisticated, making it difficult to defend against them. We devote significant resources to address security vulnerabilities through engineering secure products and enhancing security features. Our ability to deliver quality data security and privacy is critical to our business, and failure to do so could adversely affect our financial results. We face risks associated with our operating as a multinational corporation, including compliance with varied and complex laws and regulations globally. The application of these laws may conflict and involve significant costs or require changes in business practices that could reduce revenue and profitability. Our subscription-based business model provides predictable revenue, but economic conditions may impact customer spending and delay technology purchases. Our investment portfolio may become impaired by financial market deterioration, and we are subject to risks from currency fluctuations. We are also exposed to risks related to government contracts, including audits and investigations that could result in penalties. Our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected by changes in tax laws and interpretations. We continue to invest in research and development to remain competitive, and our corporate culture fosters innovation and employee satisfaction. Our ability to manage sales, partner, and distribution channels effectively is critical to our revenue, and we face risks from third-party relationships that could disrupt our business operations. We are committed to maintaining a strong technology infrastructure to support our operations and respond to market dynamics.

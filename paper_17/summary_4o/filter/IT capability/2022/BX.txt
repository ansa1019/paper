Difficult market and geopolitical conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways, including reducing the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital, which could impact our operational flexibility and strategic resource allocation. The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and the global response thereto have significantly impacted the global economy and financial markets, indicating the importance of external influences on our investment strategies. Our business is materially affected by financial market and economic conditions, which can reduce the value or performance of our funds' investments. The performance of our funds' investments is closely linked to market dynamics and the ability to manage exposure to these conditions. In a challenging market environment, we may need to reduce fixed costs and other expenses, which could adversely affect our internal processes and operational efficiency. The valuations of our funds' real estate assets have been adversely impacted by inflation, higher interest rates, and a rising cost of capital, which emphasizes the need for effective IT governance and resource management in navigating these challenges. Our funds' portfolio companies may have difficulty expanding their businesses or meeting their debt service obligations, highlighting the importance of strategic management practices and the integration of technology capabilities in our operations. The asset management business is intensely competitive, and developments in financial technology have the potential to disrupt the financial industry, necessitating a focus on innovation partnerships and technology deployment to maintain a competitive advantage. The ongoing scrutiny from regulators regarding fees and expenses charged by private funds may create additional compliance burdens, impacting our ability to leverage our IT capabilities effectively. Our operations are highly dependent on technology platforms, and cybersecurity threats could result in interruptions in our business, emphasizing the need for robust information management and data protection strategies. Our reliance on third-party service providers for technology platforms introduces additional risks, as their cybersecurity vulnerabilities could compromise our operational integrity. The evolving regulatory landscape, including proposed rules regarding cybersecurity risk management, could increase our compliance costs and potential regulatory liability, further highlighting the importance of IT architecture and governance in our strategic resource allocation. Our management and advisory fees are influenced by the performance of our investment funds, which underscores the need for effective data management and analytics to drive performance gains. The ability to adapt to changing market conditions and investor demands is critical, and our strategic alignment with technological advancements will be essential in enhancing our organizational capabilities and achieving business transformation. The complexity of our investment strategies, including the management of diversified portfolios, necessitates a focus on operational efficiency and the optimization of our technology infrastructure to support our growth objectives.

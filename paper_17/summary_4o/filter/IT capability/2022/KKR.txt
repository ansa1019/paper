Our business, financial condition or results of operations could also be materially and adversely affected by additional factors that apply to all companies generally, as well as other risks that are not currently known to us or that we currently view to be immaterial. We face operational risk from errors made in the execution, confirmation or settlement of transactions and reliance on manual processes in certain circumstances. Our and our third-party service providers' information systems and technology may not continue to be able to accommodate our growth, may not be able to adequately protect the information of our clients, may not be suitable for new products and strategies and may be subject to security risks, and the cost of maintaining such systems and technology may increase from our current level. Cyber-security failures and data security breaches may disrupt or have a material adverse impact on our businesses, operations and investments. We may collect, process, and store proprietary, confidential, and sensitive information, including personal information, intellectual property, trade secrets, and proprietary business information owned or controlled by ourselves or other parties. It is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of such information. We face several risks relative to protecting this critical information, including loss of access risk, inappropriate use or disclosure, inappropriate modification, and the risk of our being unable to adequately monitor, audit and modify our controls over our critical information. Our fund investors, stockholders, regulators and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on cyber-security matters. Our business activities may give rise to a conflict of interest with our clients. We may also encounter conflicts of interest with our insurance subsidiaries and with global atlantic generally. Our growth strategy includes reinsurance of insurance obligations written by unaffiliated insurance companies, and its ability to consummate these transactions on acceptable terms is uncertain. We may need to seek additional capital to manage its growth, and global atlantic may not be able to maintain its current strong capital position as it grows. The success of our investment will depend on their exploitation, development, construction and drilling activities and the timing and cost of drilling, completing and operating wells. Our portfolio companies generally have capital structures established on the basis of financial projections based primarily on management's judgments and assumptions, and general economic conditions and other factors may cause actual performance to fall short of these financial projections. The management of the business or operations of a real asset may be contracted to a third-party management company unaffiliated with us. We rely heavily on our financial, accounting and other data processing systems and on the systems of third parties who provide services to us. If any of these systems do not operate properly, are disabled or not appropriately updated, we could suffer financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to our various investment vehicles, regulatory intervention, fines, sanctions or reputational damage. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched, and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as external service providers, organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations, hostile foreign governments or agencies, or cybersecurity researchers. Our employees have been and expect to continue to be the target of fraudulent calls and emails, and the subject of impersonations and fraudulent requests for money, such as attempts to redirect material payment amounts in a transaction to a fraudulent bank account, and other forms of activities.
Global Atlantic has devoted significant resources to develop its enterprise risk management framework to identify, monitor, and manage financial and nonfinancial risks effectively. However, it cannot guarantee that this framework will allow it to efficiently price, identify, and predict future risks. The ability of Global Atlantic's subsidiaries to engage in reinsurance transactions may depend in part on their financial condition and is influenced by their ratings. The actual or perceived financial strength impacts its ability to sell products, and a downgrade in ratings could materially adversely affect its ability to compete, raise equity, or issue debt. Furthermore, Global Atlantic's reliance on various internal processes and controls to protect the confidentiality of client information is crucial, as any failure to protect this information could adversely affect its reputation and have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations. Global Atlantic analyzes customer data to better manage its business, but regulatory scrutiny regarding the use of big data and artificial intelligence technologies may limit its ability to use data effectively. The company recognizes that changes in accounting standards could adversely impact its reported results of operations and financial condition, particularly in terms of governance, employee training, internal controls, and disclosure. The new accounting guidance for insurance companies that issue or reinsure long-duration contracts will significantly impact Global Atlantic's systems, processes, and controls. The integration of technology into its operations is essential for enhancing operational efficiency and supporting business strategies. Global Atlantic's investment management practices are subject to laws and regulations that may restrict its ability to write insurance and reinsurance policies, make certain types of investments, and distribute funds. The company must maintain good working relationships with regulatory authorities, as failure to do so could limit its ability to obtain necessary approvals and consents. The regulatory environment is dynamic, and changes could impose additional requirements on Global Atlantic's operations, impacting its financial performance and strategic resource allocation. The company’s ability to manage growth effectively is crucial, as failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on its business and financial condition. Moreover, the complexity of developing an effective framework for assessing and managing risks highlights the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other capabilities. Global Atlantic’s IT capabilities are integral to its operational flexibility and strategic decision-making processes, influencing its capacity to respond to market dynamics and maintain competitive advantage. The company acknowledges that the evolving landscape of digital technologies presents both challenges and opportunities for enhancing its business processes and overall performance.

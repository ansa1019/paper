AbbVie depends on information technology and a failure of, or significant disruption to, those systems could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business. AbbVie relies on sophisticated software applications and complex information technology systems to operate its business, which may be vulnerable to malicious intrusion, random attack, loss of data privacy, disruption, degradation or breakdown. Data privacy or security breaches by employees or others may in the future result in the failure of critical business operations. Such breaches may cause sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to AbbVie, its patients, customers or business partners, to be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Although AbbVie has invested in the protection of its data and information technology and monitors its systems on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that such efforts will prevent material breakdowns or breaches in AbbVie's information technology systems that could have a material adverse effect on AbbVie's business. Such adverse consequences could include loss of revenue or the loss of critical or sensitive information from AbbVie's or third-party providers' databases or IT systems and could also result in legal, financial, reputational or business harm to AbbVie and potentially substantial remediation costs. In addition, while AbbVie maintains cyber insurance, it cannot guarantee that such insurance will be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of AbbVie systems. AbbVie’s strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, maximizing the benefits of the Allergan acquisition, advancing and investing in its pipeline, and returning value to shareholders while ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term. The company’s financial performance in 2022 included delivering worldwide net revenues of $58.1 billion, operating earnings of $18.1 billion, diluted earnings per share of $6.63, and cash flows from operations of $24.9 billion. AbbVie uses its expertise, dedicated people and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases. The successful discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of biologics is a long, expensive and uncertain process. There are unique risks and uncertainties with biologics, including access to and supply of necessary biological materials, such as cell lines, which may be limited and current governmental regulations restrict access to and regulate the transport and use of such materials. AbbVie must effectively and profitably commercialize its principal products by creating and meeting continued market demand; achieving market acceptance and generating product sales; ensuring that the active pharmaceutical ingredient(s) for a product and the finished product are manufactured in sufficient quantities and in compliance with requirements of the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies and with acceptable quality and pricing to meet commercial demand. The commercialization of AbbVie products may not be successful due to unexpected challenges from competitors, new safety issues or concerns being reported that may impact or narrow approved indications, the relative price of AbbVie’s product as compared to alternative treatment options, and changes to a product’s label that further restrict its marketing. AbbVie’s innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of existing clinical practices or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. The potential for continuing changes to the healthcare system in the United States and the increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid and private sector beneficiaries may result in additional pricing pressures.

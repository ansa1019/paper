The global payments industry is highly competitive, with substantial and intense competition that may materially and adversely affect overall business and results of operations. The payments industry is characterized by rapid technological change, new product introductions, evolving industry standards, and changing customer and consumer needs. Technological changes, including developments in smart cards, contactless payments, e-commerce, cryptocurrency, and artificial intelligence, could result in new technologies that may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies currently used in programs and services. The ability to develop and adopt new services and technologies may be inhibited by industry-wide solutions and standards, as well as resistance from customers or merchants to such changes. Furthermore, the complexity of payment technology requires careful management to address security vulnerabilities that differ from those faced on core payment networks. Information security incidents or account data compromise events could disrupt business, damage reputation, increase costs, and cause losses. The reliance on secure processing, transmission, and storage of confidential information in computer systems and networks is critical, as customers and other parties in the payments value chain depend on digital technologies and networks to conduct operations. The expansion of integrated and personalized products and services necessitates an enhanced information profile through data collection from multiple sources, which amplifies the impact of privacy, data, and information security regulations. Increased regulatory scrutiny and compliance burdens may arise from the need to monitor and change data practices regarding the collection, use, disclosure, storage, transfer, and protection of personal information. The operational flexibility and capability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with other resources and capabilities are essential for transforming a firm into a competitive force. The firm's IT capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources, such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, and business process understanding, to further organizational goals. The ability to effectively support business needs through IT capability has become a key factor in achieving competitive advantage. The firmâ€™s strategic resource allocation, investment decisions, and management capability in leveraging technology functionalities are crucial for driving innovation and enhancing operational efficiency. The integration of digital technologies into the business model supports the development of new payment solutions and services, which are vital for maintaining competitiveness in the evolving payments landscape. The reliance on third-party service providers for technology development and access to new technologies poses risks, as the inability of these companies to keep pace with technological developments could negatively impact offerings. The firm's ability to anticipate, develop, or adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards is critical for future success, as failure to keep pace with these developments could lead to a decline in product usage and adversely affect overall business performance.

We rely on information technology in virtually all aspects of our business. A significant disruption or failure of our information technology systems could result in service interruptions, safety failures, security violations, regulatory compliance failures, an inability to protect information and assets against intruders, and other operational difficulties. Attacks perpetrated against our information systems could result in loss of assets and critical information and expose us to remediation costs and reputational damage. Although we have taken steps intended to mitigate these risks, including business continuity planning, disaster recovery planning, and business impact analysis, a significant disruption or cyber intrusion could lead to misappropriation of assets or data corruption and could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Additionally, if we are unable to acquire or implement new technology, we may suffer a competitive disadvantage, which could also have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Cyber attacks could further adversely affect our ability to operate facilities, information technology, and business systems or compromise confidential customer and employee information. Our operating businesses face intense competitive pressures within markets in which they operate. While we manage our businesses with the objective of achieving long-term sustainable growth by developing and strengthening competitive advantages, many factors, including market and technology changes, may erode or prevent the strengthening of competitive advantages. Accordingly, future operating results will depend to some degree on whether our operating units are successful in protecting or enhancing their competitive advantages. We believe that the board's succession plan, together with the outstanding managers running our numerous and highly diversified operating units, helps to mitigate risks associated with key personnel. We need qualified personnel to manage and operate our various businesses. In our decentralized business model, we need qualified and competent management to direct day-to-day business activities of our operating subsidiaries. Our operating subsidiaries also need qualified and competent personnel in executing their business plans and serving their customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders. Changes in demographics, training requirements, and the unavailability of qualified personnel could negatively impact our operating subsidiaries' ability to meet demands of customers to supply goods and services. Recruiting and retaining qualified personnel is important to all of our operations. Although we have adequate personnel for the current business environment, unpredictable increases in demand for goods and services may exacerbate the risk of not having sufficient numbers of trained personnel, which could have a negative impact on our operating results, financial condition, and liquidity. We rely on information technology in virtually all aspects of our business, and a significant disruption or failure of our information technology systems could result in operational difficulties. Our business operations could be adversely affected directly through the loss of human resources or destruction of production facilities and information systems. We have taken steps intended to mitigate these risks, including business continuity planning and disaster recovery planning. However, a significant disruption could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.

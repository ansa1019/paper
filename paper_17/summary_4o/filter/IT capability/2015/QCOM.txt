Our revenues depend on commercial network deployments, expansions and upgrades of cdma, ofdma and other communications technologies, our customers' and licensees' sales of products and services based on these technologies and our ability to drive our customers' demand for our products and services. We also depend on our customers and licensees to develop products and services with value-added features to drive consumer demand for new 3g, 3g/4g multimode and 4g devices, as well as the selling prices for such devices. Our industry is subject to competition in an environment of rapid technological change that could result in decreased demand and/or declining average selling prices for our products and those of our customers and/or licensees and/or result in placing new specifications or requirements on our products. Competition in wireless communications is affected by various factors that include, among others: device manufacturer concentrations; growth in emerging geographic regions; government intervention; evolving industry standards and business models; evolving methods of transmission of voice and data communications; increasing data traffic and densification of wireless networks; convergence and aggregation of connectivity technologies in both devices and access points; and the evolving nature of computing. We expect competition to increase as our current competitors expand their product offerings or reduce the prices of their products as part of a strategy to attract new business and/or customers. Our future success will depend on our ability to differentiate our integrated circuit products with innovative technologies across multiple products and features and with smaller geometry process technologies that drive performance. We continue to drive the adoption of our integrated circuit products into the most popular device models and across a broad spectrum of devices, such as smartphones, tablets, automobiles, wearable and other connected devices and infrastructure products. We expect that our business has been impacted by changing industry dynamics, including an increased shift in share among our customers within the premium tier, which will continue to negatively impact sales of our integrated snapdragon processors and skew our product mix towards lower-margin modem chipsets in this tier. We continue to invest significant resources toward advancements in 3g, 3g/4g multimode and 4g lte technologies, ofdm-based wlan technologies, audio and video codecs, wireless baseband chips, our converged computing/communications chips, graphics, connectivity, multimedia products, software and services. We are also investing in targeted opportunities that utilize our existing technical and business expertise to deploy new business models and enter into new industry segments, such as products for the connected home and the internet of things; automotive; networking; mobile computing; small cells and addressing the challenge of meeting the increased demand for data; very high speed connectivity; data centers; mobile health; wireless charging; and machine learning, including robotics. Our research, development and other investments in new technologies, products or services may not succeed due to improvements in alternate technologies in ways that reduce the advantages we anticipate from our investments; competitors' products or services being more cost effective, having more capabilities or fewer limitations or being brought to market faster than our new products and services; and competitors having longer operating histories in industry segments that are new to us. We may also underestimate the costs of or overestimate the future operating income and/or margins that could result from these investments, and these investments may not, or may take many years to, generate material returns.

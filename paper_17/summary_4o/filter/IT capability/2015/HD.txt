We rely extensively on information technology systems, some of which are managed or provided by third-party service providers, to analyze, process, store, manage and protect transactions and data. Our information systems, and those of our third-party service providers and vendors, are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to these systems or our information through fraud or other means of deceiving our associates, third-party service providers or vendors. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are also constantly changing and evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time. We have implemented and regularly review and update processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of secured data and to prevent data loss. However, the ever-evolving threats mean we and our third-party service providers and vendors must continually evaluate and adapt our respective systems and processes, and there is no guarantee that they will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches or misuses of data. A failure of a key information technology system or process could adversely affect our business. Disruptions in our customer-facing technology systems could impair our interconnected retail strategy and give rise to negative customer experiences. Through our information technology developments, we are able to provide an improved overall shopping and multichannel experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from computers, tablets, smartphones and other mobile devices. We utilize our website both as a sales channel for our products and also as a method of providing product, project and other relevant information to our customers to drive both in-store and online sales. We must effectively respond to changing customer expectations and new developments. The implementation of our supply chain and technology initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail. We have made, and we plan to continue to make, significant investments in our supply chain and technology. Our focus on interconnecting retail is based on building a competitive and seamless platform across all commerce channels. We expect this facility, along with our other two new distribution centers, to enable us to reach 90% of our U.S. customers in two business days or less with parcel shipping. We also began further interconnecting our distribution networks. In fiscal 2015, we continued the pilot of our new customer order management system, which we expect to roll out to all U.S. stores by the end of fiscal 2016. Our customer experience initiative is anchored on the principles of putting customers first and taking care of our associates. Our commitment to customer service remains strong, and we have taken a number of steps to enhance this initiative to provide our customers with a seamless and frictionless shopping experience in our stores, online, on the job site or in their homes. We have implemented programs like buy online, pick up in store, and direct fulfillment, but we cannot guarantee that these programs or others we may implement will be implemented successfully or will meet customers' needs and expectations. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates and health and other insurance costs, as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations, minimum wage, or healthcare benefits. If we fail to maintain our stores and utilize our store space effectively, to provide a compelling online presence, to timely identify or respond to changing consumer preferences, expectations and home improvement needs, and to differentiate the customer experience for our three primary customer groups, it could adversely affect our relationship with customers, our reputation, the demand for our products and services, and our market share.

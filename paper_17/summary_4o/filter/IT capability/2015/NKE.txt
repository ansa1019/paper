Nike relies significantly on information technology to operate its business, including its supply chain and retail operations, and any failure, inadequacy, or interruption of that technology could harm its ability to effectively operate. The company is heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks across its supply chain, including product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales and distribution, as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes. The ability to effectively manage and maintain inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these information technology systems. Nike's ongoing work to integrate and enhance these systems and related processes in its global operations is crucial. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, including as a result of security breaches, viruses, hackers, or other causes, could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of operations, requiring significant capital investments to remediate the problem. Moreover, the company engages in electronic communications throughout the world between and among its employees as well as with other third parties, including customers, suppliers, vendors, and consumers. The information technology systems are critical to many of its operating activities and business processes and may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown. Nike's direct-to-consumer operations have required substantial investment in information systems, inventory, and personnel, and the company has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. The technology-based systems that give customers the ability to shop online must function effectively; otherwise, the operating results and ability to grow the e-commerce business globally could be materially adversely affected. Nike's commitment to product innovation and quality, along with continued investment in design and marketing, may not have the desired impact on brand image and reputation if the technology systems do not support these initiatives. The company also utilizes information technology for digital marketing, digital commerce, and the marketing and use of its Nike+ products and services. The ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment, including reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns, is essential for maintaining brand image. Furthermore, the company faces risks associated with data security and privacy, as hackers and data thieves operate increasingly sophisticated attacks that could result in the loss of valuable business data and personal information, thereby damaging customer relationships and reputation. Nike's information technology systems are integral to its operational efficiency and organizational effectiveness, and any disruptions or failures could have significant adverse effects on its business performance and financial condition.

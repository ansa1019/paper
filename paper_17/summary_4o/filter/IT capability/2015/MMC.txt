The company relies on the efficient, uninterrupted and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate its business and securely process, transmit and store electronic information. Information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources, including cyber-attacks, computer viruses and other malware, ransomware and other types of security breaches. The breadth and complexity of the company's infrastructure continues to grow, including as a result of the use of mobile technologies, cloud services, social media and the increased reliance on devices connected to the internet, which increases the potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks. The company has numerous vendors and other third parties who receive personal information from it in connection with the services offered to clients, and a small percentage of them have direct access to its systems. The integration of the information systems of the businesses acquired is complex and exposes the company to additional risk, as it may not adequately identify weaknesses in the target's information systems, which could affect the value derived from the acquisition and make its own systems more vulnerable to a cyber-attack. The company faces numerous challenges in maintaining the security of its information systems, including the need to deploy security patches in a timely manner, which is complicated by the large number of systems and platforms operated. The inability to implement, maintain and upgrade adequate safeguards could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business. The company has a history of making acquisitions, and the process of integrating the information systems of the businesses acquired is complex and exposes it to additional risk. The company also experiences risks associated with the global nature of its operations, including the need to comply with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations that may conflict with U.S. laws. The company's ability to compete successfully depends on a variety of factors, including the sophistication and quality of its services, its ability to respond to changes in client demand and industry conditions, and the effectiveness of its technology systems. The company must anticipate and respond effectively to the threat of digital disruption and other technological changes, and it has a number of strategic initiatives involving investments in technology systems and infrastructure to support its growth strategy. The company’s ability to execute on its strategic initiatives could be adversely affected if key vendors or partners fail to perform their obligations. The company is also subject to numerous claims, lawsuits and proceedings, including claims for errors and omissions, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flow. The company’s activities are subject to extensive regulation under various laws, and compliance with these laws requires significant resources. The evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or company data could subject the company to significant litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and criminal prosecution. The company’s reliance on information technology capabilities underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to enhance business strategies and work processes.

Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Our business could be adversely affected by various risks, including the difficulty in predicting customer demand for our products and the entry of competitive products. We have recently introduced products in new markets for IT operations management, customer service, and security incident management, which are important to our growth prospects. Our successful entry into these markets depends on factors such as the differentiation of our products from established competitors, the effectiveness of our research and development efforts, and our ability to market and sell effectively in these new markets. We may not have the necessary resources, including employees with the required expertise, to compete effectively. Our revenue growth rate is expected to decline, and we may continue to incur losses due to increased costs associated with our investments in data centers and cloud computing infrastructure. These investments may not result in increased revenues or growth. Competition in the IT service management market is increasing, leading to pricing pressures that may harm our financial results. Our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers and attract new customers is critical for our growth. We depend on our channel partners to grow our business and need to recruit and enable these partners effectively. Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenues, and we expect to continue making substantial investments in data centers and cloud computing infrastructure as we expand into new geographic markets. The general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies has negatively impacted our revenues. Our subscription revenues are primarily derived from fees that give customers access to our services, and we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract term. We have made significant investments in our sales and marketing capabilities to drive long-term growth, and our sales and marketing expenses have increased significantly as a result. Our research and development expenses have also increased as we continue to enhance our core platform and develop new applications. Our ability to continuously enhance our products and services to meet changing user expectations is essential for maintaining competitiveness. If we fail to effectively expand our sales and marketing capabilities, our revenue growth rate and operating results will be adversely affected. Our business depends on our existing customers purchasing additional subscriptions and renewing their subscriptions upon expiration. Our renewal rates may decline due to various factors, including customer satisfaction with our products and services, pricing policies, and global economic conditions. We face risks associated with selling to government entities and heavily regulated organizations, which can be competitive and time-consuming. Our sales cycles are long, and if they lengthen further, or if our substantial upfront sales investments do not result in sufficient sales, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. We are subject to various regulatory and compliance risks that could impact our ability to provide services and grow our customer base. Our success depends on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and brand, and we may incur significant expenses defending our intellectual property rights. Our operations involve the storage and processing of sensitive information, and we face risks related to cybersecurity threats that could harm our business and operating results.

The covid-19 pandemic has resulted in increased demand for information technology resources, as well as heightened risks of cybersecurity attacks, including social engineering attacks, which could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information technology systems. Our information technology systems are highly integrated into our business, including research and development efforts, clinical and commercial manufacturing processes, and product sales and distribution processes. The complexity and interconnected nature of these systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown or other service interruptions. Internal or external events that compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our systems and data may significantly interrupt business operations and result in substantial costs or reputational harm. We have experienced an increase in cybersecurity incidents, predominantly ransomware and social engineering attacks, particularly among third-party service providers. The reliance on third-party information technology systems has increased substantially due to the majority of employees working remotely, which has exacerbated certain business risks, including those associated with an increased demand for information technology resources. We continue to invest in the monitoring, protection, and resilience of our critical and sensitive data and systems, although there can be no assurances that our efforts will fully recover systems or data from all breakdowns, service interruptions, attacks, or breaches that could adversely affect our business operations. We also rely on sophisticated information technology systems, including software, mobile applications, cloud services, and network-connected control systems, some of which are managed or serviced by third parties. The operational flexibility and efficiency of our business are contingent upon the uninterrupted and efficient operation of these information technology systems. The ongoing global pandemic has highlighted the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to support business strategies and work processes. Our ability to perform critical functions and maintain operations has been adversely affected by workforce restrictions and the increased operational expenses associated with the support programs implemented for our staff, suppliers, and customers. The transition to a remote work environment has also created challenges in maintaining effective communication and collaboration across our organization, which is essential for achieving our strategic objectives. Furthermore, the reliance on third-party suppliers for certain raw materials, medical devices, and components necessary for the manufacturing of our products introduces additional risks related to the efficiency and reliability of our supply chain. Disruptions in public and private infrastructure, including transportation and supply chains, have adversely affected the efficiency of our business operations. The legislative and regulatory environment governing our businesses is dynamic and subject to rapid changes, which may impact our operational capabilities and strategic resource allocation. Overall, our IT capabilities have evolved to encompass the coordination of a firmâ€™s assets and internal processes, as well as their interfirm transactions and relationships, emphasizing the critical role of information technology in enhancing business performance and maintaining competitive advantage in a rapidly changing environment.

The risks and uncertainties described include any breaches in security measures or those of third-party data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers, or third-party service partners, which could cause unauthorized access to a customer's data, our data, or our IT systems. The inability to realize the expected business or financial benefits of company and technology acquisitions and investments could also pose significant risks. Additionally, operational and execution risks may arise from interruptions or delays in services from third parties, including data center hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers, which could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business. The dependency of our services on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the internet by third parties is critical, as disruptions could reduce the availability of the internet for delivering our services. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has materially affected how we and our customers operate our businesses, impacting our operating results and cash flows. The pandemic has led to changes in customer IT spending and may adversely affect our customers' ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services, delaying purchasing decisions and reducing the value or duration of our customers' subscription contracts. Our ability to maintain and enhance our brands is critical to expanding our base of customers, partners, and employees, and our brand strength depends on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality innovative products securely and reliably. The market for enterprise applications and platform services is highly competitive, rapidly evolving, and fragmented, subject to changing technology and low barriers to entry. Our success depends on our ability to effectively compete in this market and to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business. The evolving regulatory landscape, including privacy laws and data protection regulations, may limit the use and adoption of our services and adversely affect our business. Our customers expect us to meet voluntary certification and other standards established by third parties, and failure to maintain these certifications could adversely affect our ability to provide solutions to certain customers. The integration of acquired technologies and the ability to develop enhancements to existing services that keep pace with rapid technological developments are essential for maintaining our competitive advantage. Our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt or contractual obligations resulting from our leases, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively impact our financial results. The ability to attract and retain skilled employees is vital, as competition for talent in the technology industry is intense. Our future success depends on our ability to innovate and effectively manage our projected growth, which includes increasing the productivity of existing employees and hiring new personnel as needed. Our strategic investments and acquisitions may not yield the anticipated benefits, and the complexities of integrating acquired technologies could disrupt our business and dilute stockholder value. The long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial condition or results of operations remains uncertain, and we may take cost-cutting measures or delay strategic initiatives, which could negatively impact our business and reputation.

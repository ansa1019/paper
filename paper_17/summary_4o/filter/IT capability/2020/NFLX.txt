Our reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our members is dependent upon the reliable performance and security of our computer systems and those of third parties that we utilize in our operations. We utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a third-party provider. Additionally, we utilize third-party "cloud" computing services in connection with our business operations. Problems faced by us or our third-party "cloud" computing or other network providers, including technological or business-related disruptions, as well as cybersecurity threats and regulatory interference, could adversely impact the experience of our members. We rely upon Amazon Web Services to operate certain aspects of our service, and any disruption of or interference with our use of the Amazon Web Services operation would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted. Our ability to operate our service, retain existing members and add new members may be impaired if our technology or that of third parties we utilize in our operations fails or otherwise operates improperly, including as a result of "bugs" in our development and deployment of software. Any significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations, including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, could result in a loss or degradation of service, unauthorized disclosure of data, including member and corporate information, or theft of intellectual property, including digital content assets, which could adversely impact our business. We have implemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect our data and systems, but the techniques used to gain unauthorized access to data and software are constantly evolving, and we may be unable to anticipate or prevent unauthorized access. Our computer systems and those of third parties we use in our operations are subject to cybersecurity threats, including cyber-attacks such as computer viruses, denial of service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. To the extent internet service providers do not interconnect with our content delivery network or charge us to access their networks, or if we experience difficulties in our content delivery network's operation, our ability to efficiently and effectively deliver our streaming content to our members could be adversely impacted. We utilize a combination of proprietary and third-party technology to operate our business, including the technology that we have developed to recommend and merchandise content to our consumers as well as enable fast and efficient delivery of content to our members and their various consumer electronic devices. Our ability to attract and retain members may be adversely affected if our recommendation and merchandising technology does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our members will enjoy. We also utilize third-party technology to help market our service, process payments, and otherwise manage the daily operations of our business. If our technology or that of third-parties we utilize in our operations fails or otherwise operates improperly, our ability to operate our service may be impaired. We rely upon the ability of consumers to access our service through the internet, and if network operators block, restrict or otherwise impair access to our service over their networks, our service and business could be negatively affected. Changes in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across their networks could adversely impact our business.

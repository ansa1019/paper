The company's ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services, and technologies to the marketplace. The company must make significant investments in research and development, which are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to the company's core business strategy. The company's financial condition and operating results depend substantially on its ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. The company is exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by various events, which can adversely impact the company's business by preventing access to online services, interfering with customer transactions, or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of products. The company devotes significant resources to network and data security, but these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to confidential information could materially adversely affect the company's reputation, financial condition, and operating results. The company's reliance on third-party software developers is significant, as decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. The company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends on developers' perceptions of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the company's products compared to competitors' platforms. The company's operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions, and adverse macroeconomic conditions could materially adversely affect demand for the company's products and services. The company has invested in programs to enhance reseller sales, which can require substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The company's products and services may be affected by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the company's business and result in harm to its reputation. The company relies on access to third-party digital content, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, and the licensing arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms. The company's future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers, and if third-party software applications cease to be developed and maintained for the company's products, customers may choose not to buy the company's products. The company is also subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes it to potential liabilities and increased costs. Compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and expensive, increasing the cost of conducting the company's global operations. The company's business requires it to use and store confidential information, and any failure to comply with privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in significant penalties or legal liability. The company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data. The company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings, and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business, which can be expensive, time-consuming, and disruptive to operations. The company's business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions, and the company must continually introduce new products, services, and technologies to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand.

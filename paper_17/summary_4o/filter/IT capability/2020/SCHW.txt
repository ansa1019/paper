The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted the economic environment, leading to challenges in client service response and processing times, particularly when high levels of client engagement have resulted in delays accessing and using our website and mobile applications. Many employees and outsourced service providers working remotely have contributed to increased response and processing times. The timely achievement of integration milestones related to the TD Ameritrade acquisition may be more challenging, particularly with regard to technology and systems, as the integration process could result in unexpected integration issues and higher costs. The company relies heavily on technology systems to process, record, and monitor transactions, and operational risk arises due to potential inadequacies or failures related to these systems. Schwab's operations are highly dependent on the integrity and resilience of its technology systems, and any interruptions could negatively impact business operations. The company maintains a backup and recovery infrastructure to minimize business interruptions and ensure operational continuity. Information security risks are increasing, and the company has implemented an information security program to protect systems, client accounts, and data. Schwab continuously monitors its systems and collaborates with government agencies and law enforcement to address potential threats. The integration of TD Ameritrade's operations is expected to occur over 18 to 36 months, and the company anticipates incurring significant acquisition and integration-related costs throughout this process, including technology enhancements. The ability to realize anticipated cost savings and other benefits from the TD Ameritrade acquisition is subject to various risks, including the need to hire a significant number of technology personnel and potential delays in acquiring necessary technology and infrastructure components. The company has established risk management processes to identify and manage operational, compliance, credit, market, and liquidity risks, which include evaluating new or changed risks impacting the combined company. Schwab's risk management framework incorporates key concepts commensurate with the size, risk profile, complexity, and growth of the company, and senior management actively participates in the risk management process. The company’s ability to support client activity levels and manage expenses is critical in the context of evolving market dynamics and competition. The integration work includes aligning TD Ameritrade's historical risk exposures with Schwab's risk appetite, which may involve modifications to existing risk management processes. The company also faces challenges related to compliance risk, which arises from the potential exposure to legal or regulatory sanctions, fines, or penalties due to non-compliance with laws and regulations. The management of compliance risk is achieved through policies and procedures designed to monitor compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. The company’s strategic goals include maximizing market valuation and stockholder returns, which are influenced by the ability to develop and launch new and enhanced products, services, and capabilities in a timely and successful manner. The expected benefits from the TD Ameritrade acquisition and other recent acquisitions are also integral to achieving these strategic objectives.

Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including our ability to build, maintain, and scale our technical infrastructure, and risks associated with disruptions in our service. Our ability to compete effectively is influenced by our IT capabilities, which encompass the coordination of a firmâ€™s assets and internal processes. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including attracting and retaining users, businesses, and developers who build applications that integrate with our products. Our operational efficiency is dependent on the reliable performance of our products and our underlying technical infrastructure, which must scale to accommodate increasing demands as the amount and types of information shared continue to grow. The covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the shift of commerce from offline to online, increasing demand for our advertising services and impacting our advertising revenue growth. Our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger, and is significantly influenced by the effectiveness of our ad targeting and measurement tools. Changes to the regulatory environment and third-party mobile operating systems and browsers may result in limitations on these tools, adversely affecting our ability to deliver relevant ads. Our investments in data center capacity, servers, network infrastructure, and office facilities are critical to support user growth and engagement. We continue to invest in our business based on priorities that include making progress on major social issues, building new experiences, and supporting businesses that rely on our services. The effectiveness of our IT governance and management practices is essential for maintaining our competitive advantage and ensuring operational flexibility. Our user engagement patterns have changed over time, and we must manage and prioritize information to ensure users are presented with content that is appropriate and relevant. Our ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees, particularly in technical roles, is critical to our ongoing innovation and operational success. We also face risks related to data security and privacy, which can impact user trust and engagement. The complexity of our operations and the rapid evolution of technology require us to continuously adapt our IT capabilities and infrastructure to meet changing business needs and market dynamics. Our reliance on third-party services and partnerships introduces additional risks that could affect our operational effectiveness and business performance. The ongoing scrutiny of our data practices and compliance with regulatory requirements necessitates significant operational resources and modifications to our business practices, which may hinder our ability to develop and launch new features and products in a timely manner.

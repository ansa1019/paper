The pandemic has adversely affected our business, liquidity, financial condition, and operating results, impacting the demand for our products and services and the ways in which our customers use them. Our ability to compete will depend upon continued improvement in network quality and customer service, effective marketing and selling of products and services, innovation, and attractive pricing, all of which will involve significant expenses. We face intense competition from other service providers as industry sectors converge, which may adversely affect our competitive position and ability to grow. Our business involves the receipt, storage, and transmission of confidential information, and unauthorized access to this information may be difficult to prevent. We are subject to the threat of unauthorized access or disclosure of confidential information by various parties, which could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of such information. Our procedures and safeguards to prevent unauthorized access must be continually evaluated and revised to address the evolving threat landscape. System failures and business disruptions may allow unauthorized use of or interference with our network, which could materially adversely affect our reputation and financial condition. The integration of T-Mobile's and Sprint's businesses is complex and may divert significant management attention and resources, potentially disrupting our business or impacting our ability to compete. We expect to incur substantial additional expenses in connection with integrating T-Mobile's and Sprint's operations and compliance with government commitments. Our long-term strategy includes migrating Sprint's legacy customers onto T-Mobile's existing billing platforms, which may encounter unanticipated difficulties or delays. The merger has altered the size and scope of our operations, impacting our assets, liabilities, obligations, capital requirements, and performance measures. We expect to enhance the breadth and depth of our nationwide 5G network, accelerate innovation, and achieve significant synergies and cost reductions by eliminating redundancies within the combined network. The pandemic has resulted in significant volatility in the financial markets, which may impact our ability to access the credit markets and increase borrowing costs. We rely on third parties to provide products and services for our operations, and the failure of such parties could adversely affect our business. Our financial condition and operating results will be negatively affected if we experience high fraud rates related to device financing or customer payment cards. We expect to incur substantial expenses related to compliance with government commitments, which could adversely impact our business and financial condition. The challenges in satisfying the large number of government commitments could hinder our ability to effectively compete. Our ability to service our substantial debt obligations will depend on future performance, which will be affected by business, economic, market, and industry conditions. The merger may not result in the anticipated benefits or synergies, and risks associated with the integration of the two companies may lead to increased costs and operational challenges. We have incurred significant costs in connection with the merger and expect to continue to do so as we implement initiatives to realize cost efficiencies. The integration process may also impact our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key personnel, which could hinder our strategic planning and execution.

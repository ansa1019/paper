The corporation increasingly relies on its information technology infrastructure to operate its businesses remotely due to the work-from-home posture and evolving customer preferences, including increased reliance on digital banking and other digital services. Effective management of the work-from-home posture depends on the security, reliability, and adequacy of such systems. The corporation's operational and security systems infrastructure, including computer systems, emerging technologies, data management, and internal processes, are integral to its performance. The corporation is also subject to operational risks arising from reliance on third parties, including their downstream service providers, which could disrupt critical business operations and customer services. The potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout the organization and as a result of interactions with third parties and the financial services industry infrastructure. The corporation's ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to third-party systems is limited compared to its own systems. Cybersecurity risks have significantly increased due to the evolving nature and pervasiveness of cyber threats, which include sophisticated attacks that could adversely affect the ability to conduct business and manage exposure to risk. The corporation's business relies on effective access management and the secure collection, processing, transmission, storage, and retrieval of confidential, proprietary, personal, and other information in its computer and data management systems and networks. The corporation has established a comprehensive information security program designed to protect against information and cybersecurity risks. The reliance on automation, artificial intelligence, and robotics, as well as increased use of internet and mobile banking products, has heightened cybersecurity risks. The corporation's risk management framework is designed to minimize risk and loss, and it employs a broad set of controls and risk mitigation techniques, including modeling and forecasting, to manage risks associated with technology deployment and operational efficiency. The corporation's strategic plan is consistent with its risk appetite, capital plan, and liquidity requirements, specifically addressing strategic risks. The board oversees compliance risk and operational risk through its audit committee and enterprise risk committee, which provides primary oversight of reputational risk. The corporation's risk framework sets forth clear roles, responsibilities, and accountability for managing risk, and it includes a culture of managing risk well throughout the organization. The corporation's ability to manage risk is dependent on its ability to consistently execute all elements of its risk management program and develop a culture of managing risk effectively. The corporation also utilizes various models and strategies to assess and control its market risk exposures, which are subject to inherent limitations. The corporation's operational risk management includes monitoring and evaluating compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations, as well as assessing the effectiveness of the control environment. The corporation's governance framework establishes oversight of climate risk practices and strategies, which are integrated into its overall risk management processes.

We depend on information systems and technology, some of which are provided by third parties, including public websites and cloud-based services, for many activities important to our business, including to interface with our customers and consumers; to engage in marketing activities; to enable and improve the effectiveness of our operations; to order and manage materials from suppliers; to manage inventory; to manage our facilities; to conduct research and development; to maintain accurate financial records; to achieve operational efficiencies; to comply with regulatory, financial reporting, legal and tax requirements; to collect and store sensitive data and confidential information; to communicate electronically among our global operations and with our employees and the employees of our customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners and other third parties; and to communicate with our investors. We are subject to cyberattacks and other cyber incidents that are occurring more frequently, evolving in nature, and becoming more sophisticated. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and maintain our information technology infrastructure, including monitoring networks and systems, upgrading our security policies and the skills and training of our employees, and requiring our third-party service providers, customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties to do the same, our business could be disrupted. Our ability to effectively promote our existing products or introduce new products, if our advertising or marketing campaigns are not effective, or if we are otherwise unable to effectively respond to pricing pressure or compete effectively, may adversely affect our business. We continue to implement strategic plans that we believe will position our business for future success and long-term sustainable growth by allowing us to achieve a lower cost structure and operate more efficiently in the highly competitive beverage, food and snack categories and markets. Our productivity initiatives help support our growth initiatives and contribute to our results of operations. We are also continuing to implement our global operating model to improve efficiency, decision making, innovation and brand management across the global organization to enable us to compete more effectively. Our strategies are designed to address key challenges facing our company, including macroeconomic and political volatility and the continued rebalancing of the economic world; shifting consumer preferences and increasing demand for more nutritious foods and beverages; the disruption of retail; and the emergence of niche brands laying claim to large consumer segments, particularly in developed markets. We are making significant investments in attracting talent to build our global e-commerce capabilities. Our failure to make the right strategic investments to drive innovation or successfully launch new products or variants of existing products or effectively distribute our products could decrease demand for our existing products by negatively affecting consumer perception of our existing brands. We have entered into agreements with third-party service providers to utilize certain information technology support services and administrative functions, and we utilize cloud-based services and systems and networks managed by third-party vendors to process, transmit and store information and to conduct certain of our business activities and transactions. If any of these third-party service providers or vendors do not perform effectively, or if we fail to adequately monitor their performance, we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings or we may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers, which could have a negative impact on employee morale and our reputation.

The company must develop new products, adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of new products by competitors to remain competitive. Competitive factors include technological innovation, e-business capabilities, and the ability to meet the special requirements of customers. Without the timely introduction of new products, services, and enhancements, the company's offerings will likely become technologically obsolete over time, adversely affecting revenue and operating results. The company is pursuing strategies to improve internal growth, including strengthening its presence in selected geographic markets, allocating research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects, and developing new applications for its technologies. The company’s growth depends in part on the growth of the markets it serves, and any decline in these markets could diminish demand for its products and services. The company has significant operations in California, which makes it susceptible to earthquake risk, and any natural disasters could disrupt operations or impair critical systems. The company periodically implements new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain business operations, but problems could arise that disrupt the ability to provide quotes, take customer orders, and run the business in a timely manner. The company relies on its information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information, manage critical business processes, and support activities such as interacting with suppliers and fulfilling contractual obligations. Vulnerabilities to damage or interruption from various threats, including cyber-attacks, could materially interrupt operations and delay production and shipments. The company is subject to data privacy and security laws and regulations, and any failure to maintain reliable information technology systems could result in regulatory consequences and adversely affect business operations. The company’s references to strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms. The company’s ability to realize the value of goodwill and intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of acquired businesses, which in turn depend on how well these businesses are integrated. The company’s operations are affected by general economic conditions and uncertainties, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates could adversely affect reported revenues and profitability. The company’s debt may restrict investment opportunities or limit activities, and its ability to comply with financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on future performance. The company’s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges, which helps understand and evaluate the segments' core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance. The company’s investments in working capital were primarily to support growth in sales, and cash flow from operations is expected to be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future.

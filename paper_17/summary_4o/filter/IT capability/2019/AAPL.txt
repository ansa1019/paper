The company is exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by various events, which can adversely impact its business by preventing access to online services, interfering with customer transactions, or impeding manufacturing and shipping processes. The company's business and reputation may be impacted by these disruptions, which could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. The company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data; however, these measures cannot provide absolute security. Losses or unauthorized access to confidential information, including personally identifiable information, could subject the company to significant reputational, financial, legal, and operational consequences. The company relies on access to third-party digital content, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, and the licensing or distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms. The company believes that decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. The company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business, and new claims may arise in the future. The company's business requires it to use and store confidential information, and it takes steps to secure this information when provided to third parties; however, such measures are not always effective. The company has invested in manufacturing process equipment and has made prepayments to certain suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements, which help ensure the supply of components and finished goods. The company's operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions, and adverse macroeconomic conditions could materially adversely affect demand for its products and services. The company must continually introduce new products, services, and technologies to remain competitive, and its ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products. The company faces substantial competition in its markets, characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins. The company's financial condition and operating results depend substantially on its ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. The company relies on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers, and other resellers, and its financial condition could be adversely affected if these resellers stop distributing its products or reduce their ordering. The company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services to stimulate customer demand. The company's future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers, and if third-party developers cease to develop and maintain software applications for its products, customers may choose not to buy its products. The company is also subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes it to potential liabilities and increased costs. The company's operations are subject to risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers, and while the company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems, these measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities.

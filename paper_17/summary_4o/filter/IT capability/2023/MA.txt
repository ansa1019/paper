The global payments industry is highly competitive, with substantial and intense competition affecting overall business and results of operations. Our payment programs compete against competitors both within and outside of the global payments industry, including general purpose payments networks, digital wallets, and fintechs, which rely on technology to support their services. The ability to develop and adopt new services and technologies may be inhibited by industry-wide solutions and standards, as well as resistance from customers or merchants to such changes. We face disintermediation risks as parties that process transactions may attempt to eliminate our position as an intermediary. Regulatory initiatives, such as PSD2 in the EEA, may enable third-party providers to route payment transactions away from our network. Our ability to innovate or offer differentiated products may be limited by increased regulatory scrutiny and compliance burdens, which could materially and adversely impact our financial performance. The rapid and significant technological changes in the payments industry may result in new technologies that could render our current offerings obsolete, and our reliance on third parties for technology development may negatively impact our offerings if they fail to keep pace. Our investments in new networks, such as open banking solutions and digital identity capabilities, support and strengthen our payments and services solutions. Our capabilities are fundamentally interdependent, and we employ a multi-layered approach to protect the global payments ecosystem. Information security incidents or account data compromise events could disrupt our business and damage our reputation, increasing costs and causing losses. We are subject to increasingly complex laws and regulations related to privacy, data protection, and information security, which may require us to modify our data processing practices and incur substantial compliance-related costs. The expansion of our products and services has amplified the impact of these laws and regulations on our business. We are also subject to regulatory scrutiny related to our use and deployment of AI technology, which may create or amplify risks that are challenging to prevent or mitigate. Our operations rely on secure transmission, storage, and processing of confidential and sensitive information, and we routinely encounter cyber threats that could lead to significant operational disruptions. Furthermore, the complexity of our payment technology requires careful management to address information security vulnerabilities. Our ability to attract and retain a highly qualified workforce is critical to our performance, particularly in technology and other areas essential for growth. The market for specialized skill sets remains highly competitive, and our corporate culture is vital for enabling effective performance. We continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions and investments in complementary businesses, products, or technologies, but face increasing regulatory scrutiny that could impact these efforts. Our role as a guarantor of certain third-party obligations exposes us to credit and liquidity risk, and potential losses could materially affect our results of operations.

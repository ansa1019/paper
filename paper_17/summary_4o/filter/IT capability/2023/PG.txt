These IT/OT systems are utilized for various functions such as shipping products to customers, marketing and selling products to consumers, collecting, transferring, storing, and processing customer information, managing banking and cash liquidity systems, and complying with regulatory requirements. The company faces numerous and evolving information security threats that pose risks to the security of its services, systems, networks, and supply chain, as well as to the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of its data and critical business operations.

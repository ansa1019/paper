Difficulties in implementing, operating and maintaining Nike's increasingly complex information technology systems and controls, including systems related to demand and supply planning and inventory control, pose significant risks. Nike is heavily dependent on information technology systems across its supply chain, including product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales and distribution, as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes. The reliability of these information technology systems is critical to effectively manage and maintain inventory and ship products to customers on a timely basis. Nike's work to integrate, secure and enhance these systems and related processes in its global operations is ongoing, and the company continues to invest in these efforts. However, there is no assurance that these measures will be sufficient to protect against cyber-attacks, system failures or data loss. The failure of these systems to operate effectively could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of operations, which may require significant capital investments to remediate. The company has experienced cyber-attacks in the past and expects to continue facing such risks. Additionally, Nike's digital platforms must be designed effectively to work well with various technologies, systems, networks, and standards that it does not control. If these platforms do not function effectively, the ability to grow its digital commerce business globally or retain its customer base could be materially adversely affected. The company has made significant investments in digital technologies and information systems for its Nike direct operations, which include both retail stores and digital platforms. The success of these operations is contingent upon the ability to deliver high-quality digital experiences that meet the changing expectations of online shoppers. Furthermore, Nike's reliance on information technology extends to digital marketing, digital commerce, consumer engagement, and the marketing and use of its digital products and services. Any interruption in information technology systems may impede engagement in the digital space, resulting in lost revenues and damage to reputation. The company also faces risks associated with the management of foreign currency exposures, which are material to its financial performance. The implementation of the Nike Trading Company and its foreign currency adjustment program enhances its ability to manage foreign exchange risk, which is critical for maintaining operational efficiency and achieving strategic objectives. The ongoing investment in technology capabilities, including an enterprise resource planning platform and data analytics, is aimed at creating an end-to-end technology foundation that accelerates digital transformation and enhances operational flexibility. The ability to effectively manage and leverage these technology resources is essential for sustaining competitive advantage and responding to market dynamics.

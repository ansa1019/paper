As a global payments technology company, we are subject to complex and evolving regulations that govern our operations, which could limit our ability to enforce our payments system rules and require us to adopt new rules or change existing rules. The evolving regulatory focus on the payments industry could negatively impact our ability to use our intellectual property to differentiate our products and services, the quality and types of products and services we offer, and our competitive positioning. Increased scrutiny and regulation could harm our business and reduce the number of products our clients issue, the volume of payments we process, and our revenues. The global payments space is intensely competitive, with new competitors or methods of payment emerging as technology evolves and consumer expectations change. Our products compete with cash, checks, electronic payments, and alternative payments providers, which may offer more effective or innovative solutions. The competitive landscape is shifting, and we may face disintermediation due to emerging technologies and platforms, including mobile payments and alternative payment credentials. Our ability to adapt to technological change is critical, as failure to keep pace with new technologies could harm our business and impact future growth. We continuously monitor and manage balance sheet and operational risks from clients in our portfolio, including their settlement obligations. Our relationships with financial institutions, acquirers, processors, merchants, and other third parties are complex and require us to balance the interests of multiple parties. We depend significantly on these relationships to support our programs and services and compete effectively in the marketplace. The development and implementation of governance frameworks for our AI and machine learning systems may not be successful in mitigating emerging risks, and our cybersecurity and processing systems are at risk of errors, interruptions, and cyber-attacks. Our ongoing efforts to comply with complex privacy and data protection regulations may increase the complexity of our compliance operations and entail substantial expenses. We are also subject to various laws and regulations governing the development, use, and deployment of AI technologies, which are still evolving. The market is assessing how regulators may apply existing consumer protection and other laws in the context of AI, leading to uncertainty regarding future regulations. Our ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, and confidentiality is essential for meeting business needs and enhancing operational efficiency. The risks created by new laws or regulations in one jurisdiction have the potential to be replicated and negatively affect our business in another jurisdiction or product offering. Our business relies on the movement of data across national borders, and legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and security of personal data continue to evolve, creating an uncertain regulatory environment. We believe that our ability to maintain and enhance our brand and reputation is critical to our success, and we must uphold our corporate reputation while navigating the complexities of regulatory compliance and technological advancements.

The company's business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions. The company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by various events. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the company's business by preventing access to online services, interfering with customer transactions, or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of products. The company's business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information, with respect to customers and employees. The company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. However, these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information could materially adversely affect the company's business, reputation, results of operations, and financial condition. The company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems regularly, which can impair the company's ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services and expose the company to litigation or government investigations. The company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, but these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities. The company's operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers, which can disrupt the company's business and harm its reputation. The company relies on third-party software developers, and decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. The company's ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services, and technologies to the marketplace. The company's business, results of operations, and financial condition depend substantially on its ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. The company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services, and the success of new product and service introductions depends on various factors, including timely and successful development and market acceptance. The company's reliance on outsourcing partners for manufacturing and logistical services reduces its direct control over production and distribution, which can adversely affect the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided. The company has invested in manufacturing process equipment and has made prepayments to suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. However, if these outsourcing partners experience severe financial problems or disruptions, the continued supply of components and finished goods can be reduced or terminated. The company's future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers, and the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends on the developers' perception of the relative benefits of developing for the company's products compared to competitors' platforms. The company's business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws regarding data protection, and compliance with these laws can be onerous and expensive. The company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes it to potential liabilities and increased costs.

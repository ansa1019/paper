Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, including our ability to build, maintain, and scale our technical infrastructure, which is critical for supporting our IT capabilities. Our business is subject to risks related to government regulation and enforcement actions that could impair our ability to sell advertising, affecting our operational flexibility and strategic resource allocation. We face challenges in operating with mobile operating systems and networks that we do not control, which impacts our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of ads. Our advertising revenue is significantly influenced by our ability to effectively target ads, which has been adversely affected by changes in regulatory environments and third-party mobile operating systems. We are making significant investments in artificial intelligence initiatives to enhance our advertising tools and improve our delivery, targeting, and measurement capabilities. The effectiveness of our IT capabilities is also tied to our ability to manage and prioritize information to ensure users are presented with relevant content. We rely on data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control, and any changes in our ability to use such signals will adversely affect our business. Our operational efficiency is contingent upon the reliable performance of our products and services, which depends on our underlying technical infrastructure. We have experienced interruptions in the availability or performance of our products, which could harm our business and reputation. Our investments in technology infrastructure, including data centers and technical resources, are essential for maintaining our competitive advantage and supporting our business processes. We are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection, which require us to adapt our IT capabilities to comply with evolving legal frameworks. The introduction of new products and services may also be affected by our compliance with these regulations, impacting our ability to innovate and respond to market dynamics. Our ability to attract and retain users and marketers is closely linked to the perceived usefulness and reliability of our products, which are underpinned by our IT capabilities. We have implemented changes to our user data practices that reduce our ability to effectively target ads, which could adversely affect our advertising business. Our user engagement patterns have changed over time, and our ability to maintain or grow usage of our applications is critical for our financial performance. As we continue to invest in our technology portfolio, including the development of new features and enhancements to existing products, we recognize that these efforts are essential for driving user engagement and monetization. Our ongoing improvements to ad targeting and measurement are intended to drive better results for advertisers, although we anticipate that legislative and regulatory developments will continue to impact our advertising revenue. We are also focused on driving onsite conversions in our business messaging ad products by developing new features and scaling existing features. Our financial results are influenced by our ability to effectively manage our operational resources and respond to external influences, including competitive actions and market restructuring.

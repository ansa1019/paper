Nike's ability to effectively manage and maintain its increasingly complex information technology systems and controls is critical to its operations, including systems related to demand and supply planning and inventory control. The company is heavily dependent on information technology systems across its supply chain, including product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales, and distribution, as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes. The reliability of these information technology systems significantly impacts Nike's ability to manage and maintain inventory and ship products to customers on a timely basis. Nike continues to invest in enhancing these systems and related processes in its global operations. However, the company cannot assure that the measures taken to secure and enhance these systems will be sufficient to protect against cyber-attacks, system failures, or data loss. The increased use of employee-owned devices and remote work arrangements presents additional operational risks to its information technology systems, including heightened risks of cyber-attacks. Nike has experienced cyber-attacks in the past and anticipates continuing to face such risks. The company also relies on information technology systems for digital marketing, consumer engagement, and the marketing and use of its digital products and services. Any interruption in these systems may impede Nike's ability to engage in the digital space, resulting in lost revenues and damage to its reputation. Furthermore, Nike's digital platforms must be designed effectively to work well with a range of other technologies, systems, networks, and standards that it does not control. The success of its Nike direct operations, which include retail stores and digital platforms, requires significant investment in technology and the ability to adapt to changing consumer expectations. The company's strategic focus includes unifying investments in data and analytics, demand sensing, and inventory management against an end-to-end technology foundation to accelerate its digital transformation. Nike's commitment to product innovation and quality is essential for maintaining competitive advantage, and the company must continue to invest in technical innovation and high-quality products to compete effectively in the market. The ongoing financial uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, particularly for retailers, may affect Nike's sales, ability to collect on receivables, and overall financial condition. The company is also subject to various risks associated with global trade, including changes in laws and regulations, which could impact its business operations and financial performance. The reliance on a concentrated source base of contract manufacturers for its products introduces additional risks, as any disruption in the supply chain could adversely affect Nike's ability to meet consumer demand. Overall, Nike's performance is closely tied to its ability to leverage its information technology capabilities, manage operational risks, and respond to evolving market dynamics.

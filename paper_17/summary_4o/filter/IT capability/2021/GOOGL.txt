Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those related to technology developments and the need to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users, customers, and other partners. The competitive pressure to innovate encompasses a wider range of products and services, necessitating significant investments in research and development to enhance our technology and existing products. We face intense competition from both established companies and emerging start-ups, which can leverage their experience and resources to affect our competitive position. Our ongoing investment in new businesses, products, services, and technologies is inherently risky and could divert management attention. We are investing heavily in hardware and cloud services, which are highly competitive markets with rapid technological advancements and evolving industry standards. The effectiveness of our information technology and communications systems is crucial for providing our products and services, and any interruption could harm our reputation and operating results. We are in the process of implementing a new global enterprise resource planning system designed to enhance financial information flow and improve data management. However, the phased implementation may lead to delays and increased costs. Our reliance on information systems and technology to manage our business is significant, and any failure in these systems could negatively impact our internal controls and financial reporting. We also face risks related to the design and implementation of our systems, which are vulnerable to various threats, including cyber attacks and natural disasters. Our investments in technology assets, including data centers and network equipment, are essential for supporting long-term growth. The successful deployment of these assets is critical for operational efficiency and organizational effectiveness. We continue to face challenges in managing our information technology infrastructure, including ensuring data security and compliance with evolving regulations. Our ability to provide timely and reliable information to users is a key component of our information management capability. Additionally, we are subject to various regulatory risks that could affect our operations, including compliance with data protection laws and regulations that govern the use of personal information. The complexity of our technology and the scale of our operations expose us to potential legal and financial liabilities. We are committed to maintaining robust security measures to protect user data and ensure compliance with applicable laws. As we expand our international operations, we encounter additional risks related to foreign regulations and market dynamics. Our strategic management practices must adapt to these challenges to ensure continued business value and competitive advantage. The ongoing evolution of technology and user preferences necessitates agility in our business processes and a focus on delivering high-quality, innovative products and services.

Our business and the businesses of the companies in which we invest are materially affected by financial markets and economic conditions or events throughout the world, such as interest rates, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and the continued global outbreak of the strain of coronavirus identified as SARS-CoV-2. Difficult market and economic conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways, including by reducing the value or performance of the investments that we manage or by reducing the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital, each of which could negatively impact our net income and cash flow and adversely affect our financial prospects and condition. We face operational risk from errors made in the execution, confirmation, or settlement of transactions and reliance on manual processes in certain circumstances. Our public markets business line is highly dependent on our ability to process and evaluate, on a daily basis, transactions across markets and geographies in a time-sensitive, efficient, and accurate manner. We also face various security threats on a regular basis, including ongoing cyber-security threats to and attacks on our information technology infrastructure that are intended to gain access to our proprietary information, destroy data, or disable, degrade, or sabotage our systems. The covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated these risks due to heavier reliance on online communication and remote working environments, which are less secure and more susceptible to hacking attacks. Our technology infrastructure may not continue to be able to accommodate our growth, may not be suitable for new products and strategies, and may be subject to security risks, and the cost of maintaining such systems and technology may increase from our current level. We are also dependent on an increasingly concentrated group of third-party vendors that we do not control for hosting solutions and technologies. A disaster or a disruption in technology or infrastructure that supports our businesses could have a material adverse impact on our ability to continue to operate our business without interruption. Our organizational documents do not limit our ability to enter into new lines of businesses, and we may expand into new investment strategies, geographic markets, and businesses, each of which may result in additional risks and uncertainties in our businesses. We have also launched a number of new investment initiatives in areas such as core plus real estate, real estate credit, core infrastructure, growth equity, core private equity, and impact investments. Our growth strategy is based, in part, on the expansion of our platform through selective investment in, and development or acquisition of, businesses, investment products, and investment strategies complementary to our business. The expansion into new products and geographies has demanded greater management attention and dedication of resources to manage the increasing complexity of operations and regulatory compliance. Our ability to manage the costs associated with engaging a contingent workforce may also be impacted by more stringent labor rights laws in the future. We rely heavily on our financial, accounting, and other data processing systems and on the systems of third parties who provide services to us. If any of these systems do not operate properly, are disabled, or not appropriately updated, we could suffer financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to our funds, regulatory intervention, fines, sanctions, or reputational damage.
Advances in technology, including predictive medical technology that enables consumers to select products better matched to their individual longevity or mortality risk profile, could cause Global Atlantic's future experience to deviate significantly from actuarial assumptions, which could adversely impact the level of reserves and profitability. Global Atlantic employs models to price products, calculate reserves, and value assets, as well as evaluate risk and determine capital requirements, among other uses. These models rely on estimates and projections that are inherently uncertain and may use incomplete, outdated, or incorrect data or assumptions. The complexity of models employed has grown, increasing exposure to error in their design, implementation, or use, including the associated data input, controls, and assumptions. Global Atlantic's growth strategy includes reinsurance of insurance obligations written by unaffiliated insurance companies, and its ability to consummate these transactions on acceptable terms is uncertain. The ability to realize anticipated financial benefits from reinsurance transactions is also uncertain. Global Atlantic has experienced increased competition in the reinsurance market, making it more difficult to identify transactions with terms that are commercially acceptable. The NAIC is considering insurance business transfer laws that permit insurers to transfer blocks of business to other insurers by operation of law, which could materially and adversely impact Global Atlantic's ability to identify and enter into new block reinsurance transactions. Global Atlantic faces risks associated with managing reinsured blocks, such as maintaining adequate personnel and operational systems to manage such blocks. If Global Atlantic converts a reinsured block of business to a new system, there could be disruption of servicing for policyholders, leading to customer complaints, regulatory intervention, or other adverse impacts. Global Atlantic's risk management efforts may not adequately predict or offset the impact of significant natural or man-made disasters, diseases, cyber-attacks, or climate change on its business. The potential for unforeseen developments, including changes in laws, regulations, or accounting standards, may result in losses and loss expenses materially different from the reserves initially established. Global Atlantic's ability to maintain adequate internal controls is crucial, as any failure could lead to the misappropriation or inappropriate disclosure of client information, adversely affecting its reputation. The reliance on various internal processes and controls to protect the confidentiality of client information is essential, and any inadequacies could materially damage Global Atlantic's reputation or lead to civil or criminal penalties. The company's ability to use data to gain insights into and manage its business may be limited by regulatory scrutiny regarding "big data." Changes in accounting standards could adversely impact Global Atlantic's reported results of operations and financial condition. The NAIC has approved statutory accounting principles for U.S. insurance companies, and any amendments to these principles could have a material adverse impact on Global Atlantic's capital requirements and profitability. Global Atlantic's insurance subsidiaries are subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements and must comply with applicable regulations regarding the type and concentration of investments it may make. The regulatory environment is subject to scrutiny, and changes in regulations could reduce Global Atlantic's profitability.

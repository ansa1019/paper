The company's operations are highly dependent on the integrity and resilience of its critical business functions and technology systems. Schwab's business involves the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential information about clients and the firm. Information security risks for financial institutions are increasing, partly due to the use of the internet and mobile and cloud technologies to conduct financial transactions. The company has designed and implemented an information security program that integrates complementary tools, controls, and technologies to protect systems, client accounts, and data. Schwab continuously monitors its systems and collaborates with government agencies, law enforcement, and other financial institutions to address potential threats. The company maintains policies and procedures regarding the standard of care expected with all data, including limiting access to clients' personal information and enforcing internal authentication measures to protect against unauthorized use of employee credentials. The firm relies on external service providers to perform key technology, cloud infrastructure, processing, servicing, and support functions, which face technology, operating, business, and economic risks. Any significant failures by these providers could result in losses and harm to the company's reputation. The integration of TD Ameritrade's technology and systems into Schwab's platforms is critical, and the company continues to hire technology personnel and contract staff to complete this integration work within the target timeframe. The company has experienced challenges in hiring and retaining qualified technology personnel, which may impact the timely achievement of integration milestones. Schwab's technology infrastructure is essential for processing, recording, and monitoring a large number of transactions, and system interruptions, errors, or downtime can significantly impact business operations. The firm has established a backup and recovery infrastructure to minimize business interruptions and ensure operational continuity during incidents. Additionally, Schwab employs a comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage risks associated with operational, compliance, credit, market, and liquidity aspects. The company has a global risk committee responsible for overseeing risk management practices and ensuring alignment with the firm's risk appetite. The integration work with TD Ameritrade includes aligning risk management practices and evaluating new or changed risks impacting the combined company. The firm has established liquidity policies to support the successful execution of business strategies while ensuring ongoing liquidity to meet operational needs. Schwab's capital management strategy includes maintaining sufficient capital levels to support growth and meet regulatory requirements. The company conducts regular capital stress testing to assess potential financial impacts of adverse events and has a capital contingency plan to address low probability/high impact capital events. The firm has also transitioned its financial models and systems to alternative reference rates in preparation for the phase-out of LIBOR, ensuring that appropriate fallback language is in place for new investment securities. The company's ability to migrate client deposit balances to its balance sheet is dependent on maintaining sufficient capital levels and regulatory compliance.

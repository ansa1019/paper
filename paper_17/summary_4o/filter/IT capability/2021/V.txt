As a global payments technology company, we facilitate global commerce and money movement across a global network of consumers, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, strategic partners, and government entities through innovative technologies. Our advanced transaction processing network enables authorization, clearing, and settlement of payment transactions, allowing us to offer products and solutions that facilitate secure, reliable, and efficient money movement for all participants in the ecosystem. The global payments industry is undergoing significant and rapid technological change, including mobile and other proximity and in-app payment technologies, ecommerce, tokenization, cryptocurrencies, distributed ledger and blockchain technologies, and new authentication technologies. We expect new services and technologies to continue to emerge and evolve, including those developed by Visa, such as our cross-border B2B payment service. Our relationships with industry participants are complex and require us to balance the interests of multiple third parties. We depend significantly on relationships with our financial institution clients and on their relationships with account holders and merchants to support our programs and services, and thereby compete effectively in the marketplace. Our ability to adapt and keep pace with new technologies in the payments space is critical for maintaining our competitive advantage. Failure to anticipate, adapt to, or keep pace with new technologies in the payments industry could harm our business and impact future growth. We are also subject to increased regulatory scrutiny and evolving regulations that govern our operations, which could limit our ability to enforce our payments system rules and require us to adopt new rules or change existing rules. Compliance with these regulations increases our costs and could reduce our revenue opportunities. The evolving and increased regulatory focus on the payments industry could negatively impact or reduce the number of products our clients issue, the volume of payments we process, our revenues, and our competitive positioning. Furthermore, innovations in payment technology have enabled us to expand into new products and services, but they have also expanded the potential scope of regulatory influence. For instance, new products and capabilities could bring increased licensing or authorization requirements in the countries where the product or capability is offered. We continually enhance our compliance programs as regulations evolve, but we cannot guarantee that our practices will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities. Our investments in technology assets and payments system infrastructure are essential to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives. The success of our business depends significantly on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand, which is associated with acceptance, security, convenience, speed, and reliability. We believe that our clients and account holders associate our brand with these qualities, and our success depends largely on our ability to uphold our corporate reputation. The competitive landscape is rapidly evolving, and we face intense competition from clients, emerging payment providers, and governments developing national schemes and real-time payment networks. Our ability to innovate and adapt to these changes is crucial for sustaining our market position and achieving long-term growth.

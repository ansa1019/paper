Investing in our securities involves risks, including those related to our ability to grow our business and innovate in response to rapidly evolving technological and market developments and customer needs. Our participation in intensely competitive markets means that if we do not compete effectively, our business and operating results will be harmed. The ongoing evolution of privacy laws and concerns, along with the regulation of cloud computing and cross-border data transfer restrictions, may adversely affect our business. We rely on our network of partners for an increasing portion of our revenues, and if these partners fail to perform, our ability to sell and distribute our products may be limited. Our operations involve the storage, transmission, and processing of our customers' confidential data, and any actual or perceived cybersecurity events could harm our business and operating results. We must successfully continue to release new products and updates to existing products, as delays or defects may slow the adoption of our latest technologies and reduce customer satisfaction. As we target larger enterprise customers, we may encounter longer sales cycles and increased costs, which could adversely affect our financial condition. Our business strategy includes significant investments to support future sales opportunities in various government sectors, including obtaining and maintaining cloud security authorizations. However, government procurement processes are highly competitive and time-consuming, which subjects us to additional compliance risks and costs. The transformation to digital operations, enabled by our platform, increases our customers' resiliency and security and delivers additional value to their employees and consumers. We expect our revenue growth rate to continue to decline as our business matures and competition increases. Our subscription revenues are primarily derived from fees that give customers access to our ordered subscription service, and we recognize these revenues ratably over the subscription term. We also generate revenues from professional services, which are primarily on a time-and-materials basis. Our success depends on our ability to attract new customers, retain existing customers, and satisfy their requirements. The complexity of certain customer contracts may lead to variability in our revenues from period to period. Our ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting is critical, as any material weaknesses could result in misstatements of our financial results. We have made significant investments in data centers and cloud computing infrastructure to expand our service offerings and improve our technology capabilities. Our operational flexibility and ability to respond to market changes are essential for sustaining competitive advantage. As we continue to expand internationally, we face various regulatory, political, and economic risks that could adversely affect our business and operating results. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our business, and its long-term effects on our operations and financial condition remain uncertain. We will continue to monitor these developments and their implications for our business strategy and operational execution.

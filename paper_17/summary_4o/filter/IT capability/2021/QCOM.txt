The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic had an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and may continue to impact us in the future. The rapid, global spread of COVID-19 resulted in significant economic uncertainty, declines in business and consumer confidence, and a global economic slowdown, which affected demand for smartphones and other consumer devices. This decline in demand resulted in decreased demand for our integrated circuit products and a decrease in the royalties earned on the licensing of our intellectual property. The pandemic could impact our business through delayed, reduced, or cancelled customer orders; disruptions in our supply chain; and the inability of our customers to purchase or pay for our products. Additionally, we spend significant resources in understanding our key customers' feedback and specifications, which may not result in purchase commitments. Our industry is experiencing concentration of device share among a few companies, particularly at the premium tier, contributing to this trend. Political actions, including trade policies, may limit or prevent us from transacting business with certain customers, which could significantly reduce revenues. Our growth depends on our ability to extend our technologies into new product areas and industries beyond mobile handsets, including automotive and IoT, and to develop leading and cost-effective technologies for these areas. We continue to invest in research and development, particularly in support of 4G and 5G technologies. However, our investments may not generate operating income or contribute to future results that meet expectations. We may also face challenges in attracting and retaining qualified employees, particularly in specialized engineering roles, which are critical for our business strategy. Our business is also subject to intense competition, particularly in the semiconductor industry, which is characterized by rapid technological change and price erosion. We depend on our customers and licensees to develop devices and services based on our technologies, and the timing of our shipments is dependent on their deployments. Our future success will depend on our ability to differentiate our products, maintain product differentiation, and drive the adoption of our technologies in new industries. We also face risks related to cybersecurity, as our IT systems are regularly targeted by unauthorized access attempts. The perception that the pandemic has made IT systems more vulnerable has increased the volume of such attacks. We believe we have a robust cybersecurity program, but we may not be able to anticipate or repel all threats. The enforcement and protection of our intellectual property may be expensive and could fail to prevent unauthorized use. We rely on various laws to protect our intellectual property, but policing unauthorized use is difficult and time-consuming. Our licensing revenues depend on our ability to maintain a strong patent portfolio, particularly in 5G, and to extend or modify license agreements. Our business may suffer from adverse rulings in governmental investigations or proceedings related to our patent licensing practices. Changes in regulations or laws could adversely affect our business, and we may incur additional costs to comply with new regulations.

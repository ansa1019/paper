We face a variety of risks that are substantial and inherent in our businesses, including adverse effects from market conditions, operational failures, and external pressures such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Our businesses have been adversely affected by declining asset values, market uncertainty, and lack of confidence among investors, which can lead to significant volatility and impact client activity levels. A failure in our operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could impair our liquidity and disrupt our businesses, highlighting the importance of business continuity and crisis management. Our liquidity position is critical, as most financial institution failures have occurred due to insufficient liquidity. We have implemented a comprehensive capital management policy to ensure we maintain appropriate levels of capital and liquidity, even during periods of market stress. Our risk management processes include identifying and addressing potential conflicts of interest, ensuring compliance with extensive regulations, and monitoring operational risks, including those arising from human errors and external events. The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated a robust business continuity plan, allowing us to adapt to unexpected situations and maintain operational flexibility. We have established a framework for assessing and managing operational risk, which includes monitoring compliance with established limits and thresholds. Our approach to risk management is multifaceted, involving scenario analyses and stress testing to evaluate our resilience under extreme conditions. We continuously assess our credit exposures and the creditworthiness of our counterparties, particularly in industries severely impacted by the pandemic. The resilience of our operations is further supported by our ability to leverage technology and maintain effective communication among our teams. We have also focused on enhancing our operational capabilities and ensuring that our systems can withstand environmental perturbations. Our strategic initiatives aim to improve profitability and shareholder returns, while also addressing the challenges posed by regulatory changes and market dynamics. We recognize the need for adaptability in our business strategies to navigate the complexities of the financial landscape. The interconnectedness of our operations requires us to manage risks effectively across various departments and ensure that we are prepared for potential disruptions. Our commitment to organizational resilience is reflected in our ongoing efforts to enhance our operational practices, engage in inter-organizational collaboration, and maintain a future-oriented perspective. The uncertainties surrounding economic recovery and market conditions necessitate a proactive approach to risk management, enabling us to respond effectively to emerging challenges and sustain our competitive advantage.

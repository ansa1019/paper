The organization faces significant management and organizational challenges due to its size, which may impede its ability to achieve business objectives and effectively institutionalize knowledge across its operations. This complexity necessitates the development and implementation of appropriate processes and tools to manage the enterprise, instill core values, and maintain effective communication, all of which are critical for leveraging IT capabilities to support business needs and enhance competitive positioning. The potential for employee misconduct, particularly regarding the improper use of sensitive information, underscores the importance of robust IT governance and information management practices to mitigate risks and ensure compliance with regulations. Furthermore, the company's strategic shift to a new growth model through geographic market segmentation aims to better serve clients and scale operations, highlighting the need for adaptable IT resources and capabilities to respond to changing business dynamics. The integration of acquired businesses poses additional challenges that require effective resource allocation and management to retain organizational culture and operational efficiency, emphasizing the role of IT capabilities in facilitating seamless transitions and enhancing overall firm performance.

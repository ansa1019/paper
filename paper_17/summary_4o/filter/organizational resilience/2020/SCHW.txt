We face a variety of risks that may affect our operations, financial results, or stock price, many of which are driven by factors beyond our control or prediction. The challenging economic environment triggered by the coronavirus pandemic has impacted our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The pandemic has adversely impacted the economic environment, leading to heightened volatility in the financial markets, which has had a negative impact on our net interest revenue and client service response times. Many of our employees are working remotely, contributing to increased response and processing times, particularly when we experience temporary loss of services from outsourced providers. We consider service quality to be an important part of the client experience, and our failure to meet client expectations could result in decreased client satisfaction. The timely achievement of our integration milestones may be challenged, particularly with regard to technology and systems. The extent to which the pandemic impacts our business will depend on future developments, including the scope and duration of the outbreak and actions taken by governmental authorities. Our business can be adversely affected by general economic, corporate, and geopolitical developments, which play a role in client asset valuations and overall investor engagement. We rely heavily on client cash balances to generate revenue, and significant changes in client cash allocations could negatively impact our income. Our operations are highly dependent on the integrity of our technology systems and our ability to make timely enhancements. System interruptions, errors, or downtime can result from various causes, including technological failure and changes to our systems, and can have a significant impact on our business and operations. Despite our efforts to manage risks, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer unexpected losses due to technology or other operational failures. We maintain a backup and recovery infrastructure, including routine testing of business continuity and disaster recovery plans. Our risk management process includes risk identification and assessment, risk measurement, and risk monitoring and reporting. We have established policies and procedures to manage operational risk, including the reliance on third-party service providers. Our operations are also subject to extensive regulation, and compliance risks may arise from the potential failure to comply with laws and regulations. The integration of TD Ameritrade's operations is expected to occur over 18 to 36 months, and we expect to incur significant acquisition and integration-related costs throughout this process. We have adopted a policy to remain well-capitalized even in stressed scenarios, and our capital stress testing explores potential outcomes including rare and extreme events. Our liquidity needs are primarily driven by client activity and capital requirements, and we conduct regular liquidity stress testing to ensure our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity during market-related or company-specific liquidity stress events. We also monitor early warning indicators to help identify emerging liquidity stresses. The company's ability to migrate uninsured balances to its balance sheet is dependent on having sufficient capital levels and the availability of designated balances.

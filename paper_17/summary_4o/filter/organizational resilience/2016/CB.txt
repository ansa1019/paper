The text primarily discusses organizational changes following the acquisition of Chubb Corp, resulting in the establishment of new business segments, which may imply a strategic reconfiguration of resources and capabilities. While it does not explicitly mention "IT capability," the restructuring of operations into six distinct segments could suggest an underlying need for enhanced coordination of internal processes and asset management, which are critical components of IT capability. The reference to adjusting prior period amounts to conform to new segment presentations may also imply a focus on improving information management and reporting accuracy, which are essential for effective decision-making and operational efficiency. These changes could reflect a broader strategy aimed at leveraging technology and information systems to support evolving business needs and enhance competitive positioning in the market. Overall, while the text does not directly address IT capability, the organizational transformations and segment realignments hint at a potential emphasis on improving technological and informational resources to drive business performance.

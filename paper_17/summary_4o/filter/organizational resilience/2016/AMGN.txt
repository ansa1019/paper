This report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that involve certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Our business is subject to risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, and geopolitical events. We face pressures from third-party payers and pricing, which may affect our profitability and operational continuity. The concentration of purchasing power among certain distributors and payers may negatively impact our business, as they can exert significant pressure on pricing and access to our products. We rely on independent third-party suppliers for certain raw materials and components necessary for the manufacturing of our products, and any adverse developments at these suppliers could disrupt our operations. Our ability to manufacture and supply our products is dependent on the uninterrupted operation of our facilities and those of our third-party contract manufacturers, which may be impacted by various factors including labor disputes or natural disasters. We have made significant investments in next-generation biomanufacturing to enhance our operational flexibility and maintain a reliable supply of medicines. Our transformation and process improvement initiatives are designed to create a more agile and efficient operating model, enabling us to reallocate resources to support innovative pipeline opportunities. The establishment of a federal financial oversight board in Puerto Rico may impact our operations there, as economic challenges could affect the provision of utilities or services necessary for our business. We must also navigate complex regulatory environments and ensure compliance with evolving laws, which can impact our ability to obtain or maintain product approvals. Our strategic initiatives include expanding into emerging markets, which may expose us to additional risks related to political, legal, and financial instability. We continuously assess our operational resources and capabilities to adapt to changing market conditions and maintain our competitive advantage. The pressures from external disturbances, including economic conditions and regulatory changes, require us to develop resilience strategies that focus on recovery and adaptation. We are committed to fostering an organizational culture that emphasizes learning and innovation, which is essential for maintaining performance under pressure and achieving long-term growth. Our ongoing efforts to enhance our organizational effectiveness and agility are critical in confronting the challenges posed by a rapidly evolving healthcare landscape. We recognize the importance of strategic foresight and proactive measures in ensuring our resilience and ability to thrive in complex situations.

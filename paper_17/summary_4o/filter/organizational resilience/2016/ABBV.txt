AbbVie’s mission is to use its expertise, dedicated people, and unique approach to innovation to develop and market advanced therapies that address some of the world's most complex and serious diseases. The company’s strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, advancing and investing in its pipeline, and returning value to shareholders while ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term. AbbVie commits substantial effort, funds, and other resources to research and development and must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. The company’s financial performance in 2016 included delivering diluted earnings per share of $3.63, reflecting its ability to adapt to market conditions and maintain operational flexibility. AbbVie has a pipeline of promising new medicines across important medical specialties, with more than 30 compounds in mid- and late-stage development. The successful discovery, development, manufacturing, and sale of biologics is a long, expensive, and uncertain process, which necessitates a focus on operational continuity and resilience strategies. The company’s ability to realize anticipated benefits from its merger with Pharmacyclics will depend on its capability to effectively and profitably commercialize Imbruvica, ensuring that the entire supply chain efficiently delivers products to customers. AbbVie actively engages in inter-organizational collaboration, which is essential for resource generation and adaptation to external pressures. The company’s reliance on alliances with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for a portion of its products in the near-term pharmaceutical pipeline highlights the importance of strategic initiatives and resource allocation. The risks associated with AbbVie’s operations outside the United States include fluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in medical reimbursement policies, which could adversely affect its business and results of operations. The company’s ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt, or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected by material declines in demand for its products or other unfavorable changes in business conditions. AbbVie’s commitment to driving continued expansion of operating margins is expected to be achieved through productivity initiatives and ongoing efficiency programs. The company’s strategic objectives include growing revenues through strong performance from its existing portfolio and expanding operating margins, which are critical for maintaining organizational resilience. AbbVie also anticipates several regulatory submissions and key data readouts from clinical trials, which are essential for future planning and organizational success. The company’s operational management and strategic adaptation to market volatility and external disturbances are vital for sustaining its competitive advantage and ensuring long-term survival in a turbulent market environment. AbbVie’s approach to crisis management and preparedness reflects its understanding of the importance of resilience in maintaining organizational health and effectiveness.

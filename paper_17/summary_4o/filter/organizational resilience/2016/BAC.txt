In the course of conducting our business operations, we are exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are inherent in the financial services industry and others that are specific to our own businesses. Our risk management framework is designed to minimize risk and loss, enabling us to maintain operational continuity and support our businesses through challenging conditions. We continuously update our systems to support operations and growth while remaining compliant with applicable laws, rules, and regulations globally. Our ability to adapt to environmental perturbations and unexpected situations is critical for maintaining organizational health and effectiveness. We employ various models and strategies to assess and control our market risk exposures, which are subject to inherent limitations. In times of market stress or unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated, limiting the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and potentially causing significant losses. Our liquidity and competitive position are essential to our businesses, and we rely on a diversified funding approach to manage liquidity risk effectively. The ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions is crucial for sustaining our operational flexibility and strategic initiatives. We have developed and maintain contingency plans designed to prepare us in advance to respond to potential adverse economic, financial, or market stress. These plans include our capital contingency plan, contingency funding plan, and recovery plan, which provide monitoring, escalation, actions, and routines to enable us to increase capital and access funding sources. Our strategic risk management processes ensure that we can foresee and confront challenges, allowing us to adapt and reconfigure our strategies as necessary. The corporation's approach to operational risk management includes identifying, measuring, monitoring, and controlling operational risks, which may arise from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems. Our operational risk management program is integrated into our overall risk management framework, ensuring that risks are appropriately considered and responded to in a timely manner. We also focus on maintaining a culture of managing risk well throughout the organization, which is fundamental to our values and operating principles. Our risk appetite statement aligns with our strategic, capital, and financial operating plans to maintain consistency with our objectives. We utilize stress testing to evaluate the potential impacts of on- and off-balance sheet risks on our financial resiliency. The ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is reflected in our commitment to continuous improvement and adaptation in response to changing market conditions. We recognize that reputational risk can arise from various sources, including employee misconduct, security breaches, and compliance failures, which may adversely impact our ability to maintain customer relationships and operational success. Our comprehensive risk management practices are designed to enhance our resilience and ensure that we can navigate complex situations effectively, thereby supporting our long-term organizational success and sustainability.

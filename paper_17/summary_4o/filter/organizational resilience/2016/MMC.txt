The company is subject to significant uninsured exposures arising from errors and omissions, breach of fiduciary duty, and similar claims, which may divert personnel and management resources. The unpredictability of these claims and the litigation that can flow from them may have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations, or financial condition. The company relies on the efficient, uninterrupted, and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate its business and securely process, transmit, and store electronic information. Cybersecurity and data protection risks could incur significant liability or damage the company's reputation if its information systems are breached. The company is at risk of attack by a growing list of adversaries through increasingly sophisticated methods, and the potential risk of security breaches and cyber-attacks increases as the breadth and complexity of its infrastructure grows. The company regularly assesses and takes steps to improve its existing business continuity plans. However, a disaster or other continuity event on a significant scale could materially interrupt business operations and result in material financial loss, reputational harm, and legal liability. The company's operations depend on its ability to protect its technology infrastructure against damage, and an extended outage could result in the loss of clients and a decline in revenues. The company has a history of making acquisitions, which involves risks including difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and the potential for unanticipated liabilities. The success of these transactions is highly dependent on the retention of key employees of the acquisition targets. The company faces significant competitive pressures in each of its businesses, and its ability to compete successfully depends on various factors, including the quality and expertise of its colleagues and its ability to respond to changes in client demand and industry conditions. The company must anticipate and respond effectively to the threat of digital disruption and other technological changes to remain competitive. The company has numerous strategic initiatives involving investments in technology systems and infrastructure to support its growth strategy. If these initiatives do not yield sufficient return, the company’s business and results of operations could be adversely impacted. The geographic breadth of the company's activities subjects it to significant legal, economic, operational, market, compliance, and reputational risks. The company is also exposed to multiple risks associated with the global nature of its operations, including economic and political conditions in the countries in which it operates. The company cannot guarantee compliance with all current and potentially applicable laws and regulations, and failure to comply could have a material adverse effect on its business. The company’s operations depend on its ability to recover should it experience a disaster or other business continuity problem. The risk of business disruption is more pronounced in certain geographic areas where the company has concentrations of customers and employees. The company’s business disruption insurance may not be sufficient to cover the costs of recovery in the event of such a disruption. The company regularly assesses its business continuity plans and key management succession, but a significant disaster or continuity event could materially interrupt its business operations.

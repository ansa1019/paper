The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic and related impacts are having an adverse effect on our operations, financial performance, and cash flows. We are unable to predict the extent to which the pandemic and related impacts will continue to adversely impact our business operations, financial performance, results of operations, financial position, and the achievement of our strategic objectives. Our operations have faced challenges from the need to protect employee health and safety, including site shutdowns and workplace disruptions. We have experienced lower demand for certain products and services, customer requests for payment deferrals, and delays in deliveries that adversely impact our businesses. Our ability to manufacture products is highly dependent on maintaining the safety and health of our employees, which may be significantly impacted by COVID-19. Additionally, we may experience unpredictable increases in demand for certain products following economic recovery, which could exceed our capacity to meet such demand. The pandemic has subjected our results of operations and financial performance to risks, including operational challenges and staffing shortages within healthcare facilities that negatively impact demand for our products. We have implemented business continuity plans, including establishing a medical advisory group for employees and leveraging work-from-home infrastructure to facilitate social distancing. Our global crisis management team has focused on protecting our employees and customers, optimizing our operations, and securing our supply chain. We continue to believe our long-term fundamentals remain strong and will manage through these challenges with strategic focus. Furthermore, we have undertaken restructuring and optimization initiatives to enhance our growth potential and position us for long-term success. These activities include supply chain network optimization and building functional capabilities that support business growth. We expect these restructuring initiatives to result in significant cost savings, which will be reinvested in strategic growth initiatives. The COVID-19 pandemic has also created a highly competitive environment for talent, impacting our ability to attract and retain key personnel. We are committed to advancing medical technologies and investing in meaningful research and development projects across our businesses, which is essential for maintaining operational flexibility and adaptability in response to changing market conditions. Our strategic initiatives aim to ensure we are appropriately structured and resourced to deliver sustainable value to patients and customers while navigating the complexities of the current business environment. The uncertainties surrounding the pandemic and its economic consequences may continue to heighten various risks, including those related to operational continuity and financial performance. We are focused on ensuring that our organizational practices and capabilities are resilient in the face of external pressures and disruptions, thereby maintaining our operational integrity and performance.

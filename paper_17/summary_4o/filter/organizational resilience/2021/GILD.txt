In evaluating our business, we note that our operations could be affected by factors, events, or uncertainties that may not be presently known or considered significant risks. Our success depends on developing and commercializing new products or expanding the indications for existing products, which requires operational flexibility and the ability to adapt to changing market conditions. We face significant competition from global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, which affects our ability to maintain pricing and market share. The dynamic nature of the pandemic has resulted in unpredictable outcomes for our supply and distribution, impacting our operational continuity and necessitating effective crisis management strategies. The pandemic has caused disruptions to our global supply chain and distribution, which may result in higher costs and interruptions in our distribution capabilities. We are also subject to significant public attention and scrutiny over decisions regarding supply, allocation, and distribution of our products, which can affect our corporate reputation and operational effectiveness. Our reliance on third-party manufacturers and corporate partners introduces additional risks, as their operational and financial risks are out of our control. The ability to forecast demand accurately is critical, as fluctuations in purchasing patterns can lead to unexpected changes in our operating results. We expect to continue experiencing fluctuations in purchasing patterns due to economic conditions and budget pressures, which may not reflect actual patient demand. Our product development cycle is characterized by significant investments of resources, long lead times, and unpredictable outcomes, necessitating a robust risk management framework to mitigate potential failures. We also face risks related to the health, safety, morale, and productivity of our employees during the pandemic, which could impact our operational management and overall performance. The pandemic has amplified many of the risks described throughout our risk factors, including supply chain disruptions and the need for effective resource allocation. Our strategic initiatives include expanding our internal and external innovation, strengthening portfolio strategy, and increasing patient benefit and access, all of which are essential for maintaining organizational resilience. We continually review our research and development projects based on unmet medical needs, reallocating resources to support long-term growth. Our ability to achieve our strategic goals is subject to uncertainties, including the ongoing effects of the pandemic and the potential for adverse regulatory actions. We also recognize the importance of maintaining strong relationships with third parties for sales and marketing performance, as disruptions in these collaborations could negatively impact our business. The evolving landscape of environmental, social, and governance matters presents additional operational and reputational risks, necessitating proactive measures to align with stakeholder expectations. Our strategic planning includes a focus on disciplined expense management and the need to adapt to external pressures while ensuring the sustainability of our operations.

We face a variety of risks that are substantial and inherent in our businesses, including operational risks that could impair our liquidity, disrupt our businesses, and damage our reputation. A failure in our operational systems or infrastructure, as well as human error, could lead to significant operational delays or failures. Our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process and monitor a large number of transactions, and compliance with legal and regulatory standards has become increasingly challenging. We have developed and implemented a business continuity planning strategy to ensure that critical functions can continue to operate in the event of a disruption. Our operational risk management framework includes a focus on business resilience, ensuring that we can maintain operational continuity and respond effectively to unexpected situations. We continuously monitor our liquidity position and maintain high liquidity levels to meet potential cash and collateral needs during a liquidity crisis. Our risk management processes are designed to identify, assess, monitor, and manage risks, including the risks associated with operational disruptions and external pressures. We employ structured products to benefit our clients and hedge our own risks, and our liquidity management policies are designed to ensure we have sufficient funding to support our operations even during adverse conditions. The ongoing assessment of our risk exposure includes the evaluation of potential impacts from unforeseen events, such as pandemics or extreme weather conditions, which could disrupt our operations and affect our ability to service clients. We also recognize the importance of maintaining a flexible operational structure that can adapt to changing market conditions and client needs. Our strategic initiatives focus on enhancing our resilience capabilities, including the integration of climate risk into our risk management processes. We have established a framework to ensure that we can respond effectively to crises and maintain our organizational health. Additionally, we have implemented measures to enhance our operational resilience, including the development of recovery plans and the establishment of a comprehensive risk governance structure. Our approach to risk management emphasizes the importance of collaboration across departments and the need for inter-organizational cooperation to effectively address challenges. We continuously evaluate our operational practices and adapt our strategies to ensure that we can maintain performance under pressure and respond to external disturbances. Our commitment to resilience is reflected in our proactive measures to identify and mitigate risks, ensuring that we can navigate complex situations and sustain our competitive advantage in turbulent markets. We recognize that effective risk management is critical to our success and have established a robust framework to support our organizational resilience efforts.

Investing in our securities involves risk, and our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by various factors, including difficult market and economic conditions. We attempt to mitigate known risks, but we can provide no assurance that our mitigation efforts will be successful. Our business and the businesses of the companies in which we invest are materially affected by financial markets and economic conditions or events throughout the world, such as interest rates, inflation rates, economic uncertainty, and the continued global outbreak of COVID-19, which has caused and may further cause disruptions to our business. Such conditions may also result in reduced opportunities for us and our funds to exit and realize value from their existing investments and lower-than-expected returns on existing investments. Our portfolio companies may have difficulty in expanding their businesses and operations or become unable to pay their expenses or other obligations as they become due, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and cash flow. Adverse conditions may also increase the risk of default with respect to investments that we manage. The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the potential adverse effects on our business, financial performance, and operating results, which may be material and affect us in ways that we cannot foresee. We have implemented various initiatives intended to reduce the impact of COVID-19, such as maintaining business continuity and enabling remote work. However, the scale and scope of the pandemic may exacerbate risks to our operations and employee well-being. Our ability to raise additional or successor funds could be materially adversely affected by poor performance by existing funds, and unfavorable market conditions may limit our ability to find suitable investments or secure financing on attractive terms. We may also face difficulties in realizing value from investments due to market dislocation, which could limit our ability to execute our business strategy effectively. Our investment strategies may involve complex regulatory, legal, and operational risks, and we may not be successful in managing these complexities. The performance of our funds and our ability to raise new funds could be impacted by the evolving preferences of our fund investors, which may necessitate that alternatives to the traditional investment fund structure become a larger part of our business. Our growth strategy includes pursuing new investment strategies and expanding into new geographic markets, which may introduce additional regulatory complexity and operational risks. We rely on our employees and key personnel, and their loss could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our organizational structure and the relationships with our portfolio companies may also expose us to conflicts of interest. Our ability to manage risks effectively is critical to maintaining operational continuity and achieving our major objectives. The regulatory environment continues to evolve, and changes could impose additional burdens on our operations, impacting our ability to adapt and respond to external pressures. The performance of our investment funds is subject to significant variability due to market conditions, and our success depends on our ability to generate attractive returns while managing the associated risks effectively.
The fair value of the embedded derivative component includes assumptions about future interest rates and interest rate structures, future costs for options used to hedge the contract obligations, projected withdrawal and surrender activity, and the level and limits on contract participation in any future increases in market indexes such as the S&P 500 index. Changes in interest rates, future index credits, and projected withdrawal and surrender activity can have a significant impact on the value of the embedded derivative. Global Atlantic incurs significant costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance business. The company establishes an unearned revenue reserve liability for revenues from certain universal life insurance products that are deferred to future periods. Global Atlantic periodically revises the key assumptions used in the calculation of the amortization of deferred revenues and expenses as part of the assumption review process. If estimates of future gross profits or margins are revised down, then the amortization of deferred revenues and expenses will be accelerated in the period of the change and will result in a charge to income, which could have a material adverse effect on profitability. Global Atlantic's reserves are estimated based on data and models that include many assumptions and projections, which are inherently uncertain and involve significant judgment, including assumptions as to the levels and/or timing of receipt or payment of premiums, benefits, claims, expenses, interest credits, investment results, mortality, morbidity, longevity, and persistency. The company reviews the adequacy of its reserves and the assumptions underlying those reserves periodically. Global Atlantic's growth strategy includes reinsurance of insurance obligations written by unaffiliated insurance companies, and its ability to consummate these transactions on acceptable terms is uncertain. Global Atlantic has experienced increased competition in the reinsurance market, making it more difficult to identify transactions with terms that are commercially acceptable. The company faces risks associated with managing reinsured blocks, such as maintaining adequate personnel and operational systems to manage such blocks. Global Atlantic is exposed to risks related to natural and man-made disasters and catastrophes, diseases, epidemics, pandemics, malicious acts, war, cyber-attacks, and climate change, which could adversely affect its business and financial results. The company's risk management efforts, insurance, and other precautionary plans may not adequately predict or offset the impact of such events on its business. Global Atlantic's ability to maintain strong financial strength ratings is crucial for its competitive position, and downgrades in ratings could materially adversely affect its ability to compete, raise equity, or issue debt. The company employs models to price products, calculate reserves, and evaluate risk, but these models rely on estimates and projections that are inherently uncertain. Changes in regulations affecting global Atlantic's businesses may reduce profitability and limit growth. The company must maintain minimum levels of statutory capital, surplus, and liquidity, and failure to meet applicable requirements could subject it to examination or corrective action by regulators. Global Atlantic's insurance segment results are from the acquisition date through the end of the reporting period, and the company reviews the adequacy of its reserves, deferred revenue, and expenses at least annually.

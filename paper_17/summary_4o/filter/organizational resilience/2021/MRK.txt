The company is subject to a number of risks that could materially adversely affect its business, results of operations, cash flow, financial condition, or prospects. The company faces continued pricing pressure with respect to its products, and unfavorable or uncertain economic conditions could negatively affect the company's operating results. The company has significant global operations, which expose it to additional risks, and any adverse event could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations and financial condition. The company is increasingly dependent on sophisticated software applications and computing infrastructure, and past cyber-attacks have led to disruptions in worldwide operations, including manufacturing, research, and sales operations. The company continues to enhance its systems to guard against future attacks and improve recovery speed from such incidents. The covid-19 pandemic has caused disruption and volatility in the company's global supply chain network, which may result in delays in shipments of raw materials and packaging, as well as related cost inflation. The company's ability to generate profits and operating cash flow depends largely upon the continued profitability of its key products, and any events that adversely affect these products could have a significant adverse impact on results of operations and financial condition. The company must maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and successful new indications for existing products to cover substantial research and development costs and replace sales lost as profitable products lose market exclusivity. The company is exposed to market risk from fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates, and it employs hedging agreements to mitigate these risks. The company has been taking steps to increase sales in emerging markets, but there is no guarantee that these efforts will succeed, and the company may be required to increase reliance on third-party agents, which may increase risk exposure. The company believes that climate change has the potential to negatively affect its business and results of operations, with physical risks including extreme weather conditions and rising sea levels. The company is also exposed to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters that may impact its business and reputation, as stakeholders are increasingly sensitive to ESG concerns. The company faces risks related to the development, manufacturing, and commercialization of biologics and vaccines, which is a long, complex, expensive, and uncertain process. The company must adapt to regulatory changes and evolving market conditions, which may require reconfiguring its strategies and operations. The company has implemented a restructuring program aimed at optimizing its manufacturing and supply network, which is expected to result in significant cost savings. The company's success is dependent on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, and failure to do so could affect its ability to develop and commercialize products successfully. The company is committed to maintaining operational continuity and resilience in the face of various pressures, including economic fluctuations, competitive landscapes, and regulatory changes.

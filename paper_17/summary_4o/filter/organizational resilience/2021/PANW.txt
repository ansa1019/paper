Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including ongoing global economic uncertainty, which could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. The impacts of COVID-19 may disrupt the operations of our end-customers and channel partners, potentially leading to increased requests for delayed payment terms or product discounts. We have experienced growth and increased demand for our products and subscriptions, and if we do not effectively manage future growth or improve our systems, processes, and controls, our operating results could be adversely affected. The variability and unpredictability of our operating results may result in our failure to meet revenue expectations, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. We rely on our channel partners for sales, and if these partners fail to perform, our ability to sell and distribute our products will be limited. Our ability to respond effectively to technological and market developments is crucial, as failure to do so may harm our competitive position. We must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, as well as our operational and administrative systems, to manage future growth effectively. The ongoing global economic uncertainty may cause our end-customers to modify spending priorities or delay purchasing decisions, leading to lengthened sales cycles. We are actively monitoring the situation regarding COVID-19 and have implemented measures to mitigate its spread and minimize risk to our employees and partners. Our corporate culture fosters innovation, teamwork, and knowledge transfer, which are critical to our success and ability to retain skilled personnel. If we fail to preserve our culture as we grow, it could limit our ability to innovate and execute our business strategy. We anticipate that our operating expenses will continue to increase as we grow, and any failure to manage our growth effectively could result in increased costs and disrupt existing end-customer relationships. Our revenue growth is dependent on our ability to expand the deployment of our portfolio and create demand for new offerings. We are subject to various risks associated with international sales and operations, including political, economic, and social uncertainty, which could adversely affect our business. We face intense competition in our market, and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position may be challenged by larger competitors with greater resources. Our reliance on manufacturing partners exposes us to risks related to supply chain disruptions, which could prevent us from fulfilling customer orders on time. The complexity of managing our supply chain may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue. Our ability to provide high-quality technical support services is essential for customer satisfaction and retention, and any failure to do so could adversely affect our business. We must continue to invest in research and development to maintain our competitive position, and our future performance depends on our ability to innovate and respond to changing customer needs. The occurrence of any major disruptions, whether due to natural disasters, cyberattacks, or pandemics, could significantly impact our operations and financial performance.

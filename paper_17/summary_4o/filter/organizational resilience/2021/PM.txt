The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created significant societal and economic disruption, resulting in closures of stores, factories, and offices, and restrictions on manufacturing, distribution, and travel, all of which have adversely impacted our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial position. Our business continuity plans and other safeguards might not always be effective to fully mitigate their impact. The significant adverse impact of COVID-19 on the economic or political conditions in markets in which we operate could result in changes to the preferences of our adult consumers and lower demand for our products, particularly for our mid-price or premium-price brands. Our ability to recover from such disruptions depends on our organizational resilience and adaptability to changing market conditions. We are continuously evolving our approach to business continuity planning and backups to provide appropriate business resilience, particularly in light of the increasing cyber threat landscape. The reliance on third-party resources may negatively impact the quality and availability of our products and services, diminishing our direct control and potentially placing us at a competitive disadvantage. Our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations is critical. We face intense competition and must promote brand equity successfully, develop new products and markets, and ensure effective adult consumer engagement. The competitive environment can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions, erosion of consumer confidence, and regulatory changes that restrict access to truthful information about our reduced-risk products. Our strategic priorities include developing and commercializing products that present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to those products versus continued smoking. We must conduct rigorous scientific studies to substantiate that these products reduce exposure to harmful constituents and advocate for science-based regulatory frameworks. The unpredictability of our reduced-risk products compared to our mature cigarette business may significantly impact our projected results, particularly during the early stages of this new product category and due to supply chain disruptions. Our financial results could be materially affected by regulatory initiatives that lead to a significant decrease in demand for our brands. We must continue transforming our culture and ways of working, align our talent and organizational design with our increasingly complex business needs, and innovate to become a consumer-centric business. The successful integration of acquired businesses and their operations into our own is subject to various risks and uncertainties, including the challenge of integrating complex organizations and systems. Our ability to achieve strategic goals may be impaired if we fail to attract, motivate, and retain the best global talent. The impact of government actions aimed at increasing regulatory requirements could further reduce consumption levels and increase the risk of counterfeiting and illicit trade. We are subject to various administrative and legal challenges related to our reduced-risk product activities, which may affect our commercialization efforts and public communication activities. The ongoing challenges necessitate a focus on resilience strategies, operational flexibility, and the ability to adapt to unexpected situations to maintain organizational health and effectiveness.

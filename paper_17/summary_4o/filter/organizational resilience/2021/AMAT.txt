The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and global measures taken in response have adversely impacted applied's operations and financial results, affecting its supply chain, manufacturing, logistics, workforce, and operations. The pandemic has created considerable uncertainty regarding the duration, scope, and severity of its impacts on the business and the global economy. Applied has a multi-phase plan to return to working on-site, which allows additional workers to return while practicing social distancing and other safety measures. However, there is no assurance that such plans will effectively prevent the transmission of COVID-19 within the workplace. The company is exposed to risks associated with operating a global business, including uncertain global economic and political conditions, supply chain interruptions, and the need to manage a diverse workforce. These factors may adversely affect applied's ability to maintain appropriate business processes and comply with regulatory requirements. 

The company must effectively manage its resources and production capacity to meet rapidly changing demand in the semiconductor and display industries. During periods of increasing demand, applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory while also managing its supply chain and retaining qualified employees. Conversely, during periods of decreasing demand, applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with market conditions. Failure to manage these challenges could significantly impact business performance and financial condition. 

Applied's strategic priorities include developing products that solve customer challenges at technology inflections and expanding its market opportunities. The company continues to invest in research, development, and engineering to assure the availability of innovative technology that meets customer requirements. The growth of data and emerging end-market drivers are creating new opportunities for the industry, necessitating the adaptation of products to meet evolving customer needs. 

Applied's ability to attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees is vital to its success and competitiveness. The loss or retirement of knowledgeable employees poses challenges that may result in unexpected costs and reduced productivity. The company also faces risks related to supply chain disruptions, manufacturing interruptions, and the failure to accurately forecast customer demand, which could adversely affect its ability to meet customer demand and lead to higher costs. 

The semiconductor and display industries are characterized by ongoing changes that impact demand and profitability. Applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources to avoid excess or obsolete inventory. The company is also exposed to risks associated with business combinations, acquisitions, and strategic investments, which involve numerous risks that could disrupt ongoing operations and impact financial results. 

In summary, applied's ability to navigate the complexities of the global business environment, manage operational flexibility, and maintain resilience in the face of external pressures will be crucial for its continued success and adaptability in a rapidly changing market landscape.

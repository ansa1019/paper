The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting containment measures have caused economic and financial disruptions globally, impacting our supply chain and business operations. We continue to address these supply chain challenges and cost impacts, which we expect will persist. The magnitude and duration of the disruption, along with its continuing impact on us, remain uncertain. Disruptions include unprecedented actions such as travel bans, business closures, and social distancing measures. Our customers have experienced disruptions in their operations, resulting in delayed, reduced, or canceled orders, which may adversely affect our results of operations. The pandemic may also lead to long-term changes in customer needs for our products and services, necessitating adjustments to our offerings. The shift to a remote working environment creates challenges, impacting employee productivity and our ability to enhance and support existing products. We have seen increased disruption and volatility in capital markets and credit markets due to the pandemic, which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources. The ongoing economic uncertainty may exacerbate other risks discussed in this report. Our operating results may fluctuate in future periods, influenced by various factors including demand for our products and services, changes in sales cycles, and manufacturing lead times. We have experienced component shortages that have affected our operations, leading to longer lead times and increased costs. We have increased our efforts to procure components to meet customer expectations, which contributes to rising inventory and purchase commitments. Our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend on timely deliveries from suppliers and contract manufacturers. We have made significant investments in our strategic priorities to develop new products and enhance existing offerings, but the complexity and uncertainty of the market necessitate careful management of resources. Our restructuring plan aims to realign the organization and enable further investment in key priority areas, with anticipated cost savings. We continue to monitor the pandemic and take appropriate actions in accordance with relevant authorities. The impact of the pandemic on our operational and financial performance is uncertain and will depend on various external factors. We are focused on maintaining operational continuity and adapting our strategies to navigate these challenges. Our ability to execute on strategic plans and respond to changing market conditions is critical for sustaining performance and achieving long-term objectives. We recognize the importance of resilience strategies, including risk assessment and resource management, to mitigate the effects of external pressures and ensure organizational effectiveness. The dynamic nature of our business environment requires ongoing adaptation and innovation to maintain competitive advantage and support organizational health.

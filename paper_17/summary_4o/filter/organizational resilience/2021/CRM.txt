The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and other key metrics. Our ability to mitigate risks is impacted by the complexity of our services and the need to adapt to evolving market conditions. We have developed systems and processes designed to protect our customers' and our customers' customers' proprietary and other sensitive data, but we can provide no assurances that such measures will provide absolute security or that a material breach will not occur. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, public health emergencies, and other events beyond our control, which could adversely affect our ability to deliver services. We maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, but the occurrence of such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, and could decrease demand for our services. Our corporate headquarters and a significant portion of our personnel are located near major seismic faults, and we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct earthquake-related losses. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and continues to disrupt our operations and those of our customers, impacting productivity and potentially leading to increased attrition rates. We have experienced significant growth in our customer base and personnel, particularly through acquisitions, which has placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational, and financial infrastructure. Our ability to scale operations and increase productivity is critical to successfully implementing our business plan. We regularly upgrade or replace our various software systems and processes, and delays or unforeseen problems could negatively impact our operations. Our success depends in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively. We are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel due to the complexity of our services and technologies. The loss of key members of our management team or development and operations personnel could seriously harm our business. The technology industry is subject to substantial competition for skilled personnel, and we may not be successful in recruiting or retaining talent. Our corporate culture, which fosters collaboration and recognition, may be challenged as we grow and expand globally. We continue to invest in a variety of customer programs and initiatives to maintain consistent attrition rates, which play a role in our ability to sustain growth in subscription and support revenues. Our ability to realize the expected benefits from acquisitions may be impacted by integration challenges, and we may face increased costs and operational difficulties as we expand our service offerings. The evolving regulatory environment, particularly regarding data privacy and cybersecurity, may impose additional burdens on our operations and limit the use and adoption of our services. Our efforts to expand our service offerings and to develop and integrate existing services may not succeed, potentially reducing our revenue growth rate and harming our business. We are committed to enhancing our resilience strategies to confront these challenges and ensure operational continuity in the face of adversity.

The risks described could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We are highly dependent on the financial performance of our U.S. and Canadian operations, which comprised significant portions of net sales and operating income. Declines in financial performance could arise from slow growth or declines in comparable warehouse sales, negative trends in operating expenses, and failing to meet targets for warehouse openings. We may be unsuccessful in implementing our growth strategy, including expanding our business in existing and new markets, which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. We seek to expand in existing markets to attain greater overall market share, but associated risks include difficulties in attracting members and competition with established competitors. Disruptions in our merchandise distribution could adversely affect sales and member satisfaction, and we depend on the orderly operation of the merchandise receiving and distribution process. Unforeseen disruptions due to catastrophic events or labor issues may result in delays in merchandise delivery, adversely affecting sales and member satisfaction. We rely extensively on information technology to process transactions and manage our businesses, and failures or disruptions in these systems could adversely affect our operations. The risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken, although we believe our change management process will mitigate this risk. We are predominantly self-insured, with insurance coverage for certain catastrophic risks, and the occurrence of significant claims could adversely impact our financial condition. We face strong competition from other retailers, and our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures could result in lost market share. General economic factors may adversely affect our business, including fluctuations in commodity prices and changes in consumer confidence. Natural disasters or other catastrophes could negatively affect our business and financial condition, including physical damage to properties and disruptions in the supply of products. Public health issues could disrupt our operations or have an adverse impact on consumer spending. Our profitability could be affected by climate change, which may impact our ability to procure needed commodities and could be associated with extreme weather conditions. We must attract, train, and retain highly qualified employees, and our success depends on the contributions of senior management and key personnel. Failure to maintain membership loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our results of operations, and maintaining consistent product quality is essential to developing and maintaining member loyalty. We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which could negatively affect our relationship with members and demand for our products. Our financial performance depends heavily on our ability to control costs, and modest changes in various items in the income statement can have substantial impacts on net income. We are involved in legal proceedings that could adversely affect our business and financial condition, and failure to comply with laws and regulations could result in significant costs and penalties. The preparation of our financial statements requires significant judgment and estimates, and changes in accounting standards could materially impact our financial condition.

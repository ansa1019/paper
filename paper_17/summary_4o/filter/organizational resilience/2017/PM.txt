The organizationâ€™s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity is critical. Our business faces significant governmental action aimed at increasing regulatory requirements, which could reduce consumption levels and increase down-trading. The competitive environment can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions and erosion of consumer confidence, necessitating effective responses to external pressures. Our operations may be influenced by economic, regulatory, and political developments, as well as natural disasters, which could disrupt our supply chain, manufacturing capabilities, or distribution capabilities, thereby impacting our performance. We are subject to changes in adult consumer preferences influenced by local economic conditions, which may require us to adapt our strategies to maintain brand equity and develop new products. The failure of our information systems to function as intended could result in business disruption and loss of revenue, highlighting the importance of operational continuity and crisis management. Our ability to implement our strategy may be impaired by the decreasing social acceptance of cigarette smoking, necessitating a focus on innovation and transformation toward smoke-free products. We recognize that our success depends on our capacity to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and to reconfigure our strategies in response to evolving market conditions. The need for effective risk management is underscored by the potential for litigation related to tobacco use, which could substantially reduce profitability and impair liquidity. Our growth strategy includes strengthening our brand portfolio and market positions through selective acquisitions, which requires an understanding of the complexities and risks involved in integrating new businesses. We aim to ensure that our smoke-free products meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements, which is essential for maintaining competitive advantage. The challenges posed by counterfeiting, contraband, and legal cross-border purchases necessitate a robust response to safeguard our market position. Our ability to grow profitability may be limited by our inability to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully, emphasizing the need for strategic adaptation and resource management. We must ensure adequate production capacity to meet demand while navigating the pressures of increased regulatory scrutiny and shifting consumer behaviors. The potential impact of climate change on agricultural products used in manufacturing could affect our profitability, necessitating proactive measures to address these risks. Our strategic priorities include developing reduced-risk products and advocating for science-based regulatory frameworks, which are vital for our long-term resilience and adaptability in a turbulent market environment.

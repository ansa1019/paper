In the course of conducting our business operations, we are exposed to a variety of risks that could affect our businesses, results of operations, and financial condition. We manage risks through a comprehensive approach that includes identifying, measuring, monitoring, and controlling key risks. Our risk management framework is designed to minimize risk and loss, and we emphasize the importance of maintaining a strong and flexible financial position to withstand challenging economic conditions. Our operational risk management includes measures to mitigate risks associated with inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems, as well as external events. We maintain contingency plans to prepare for potential adverse economic or market stress, which includes our capital contingency plan and contingency funding plan. 

The ability to adapt to unexpected situations is crucial for maintaining operational continuity. We continuously update our systems to support operations and growth while remaining compliant with applicable laws and regulations. Our strategic risk management is embedded in every business, ensuring that we respond effectively to changes in the regulatory, macroeconomic, or competitive environments. The board reviews and approves our strategic plan, which aligns with our risk appetite and capital plan. 

We employ various models and strategies to assess and control our market risk exposures, which are subject to inherent limitations. Our liquidity risk management aims to meet expected or unexpected cash flow needs while supporting our businesses under a range of economic conditions. We utilize a centralized funding approach to enhance our ability to monitor liquidity requirements and minimize borrowing costs. 

In times of market stress, we recognize that previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated, which can limit the effectiveness of our hedging strategies. We continuously monitor our liquidity position and stress test our portfolio to understand potential impacts on balance sheet, earnings, and capital. The ongoing low-interest-rate environment and recent flattening of the yield curve could negatively impact our liquidity and financial condition. 

Our risk management framework includes a culture of managing risk well, which is fundamental to our values and operating principles. We prioritize risks to maintain a strong financial position and take advantage of growth opportunities. The board and its committees oversee our risk management activities, ensuring that we are prepared to confront potential risks and respond effectively to crises. 

We recognize the importance of inter-organizational collaboration and stakeholder engagement in enhancing our resilience strategies. Our operational flexibility allows us to adapt to changing market conditions and customer needs. We continuously evaluate our risk profile and adjust our strategies accordingly to maintain organizational effectiveness and performance under pressure. 

The ability to foresee and mitigate risks is essential for our survival and success in a turbulent market environment. We actively engage in knowledge management and learning processes to enhance our organizational resilience and adaptability. Our commitment to operational management and strategic adaptation enables us to navigate complex situations and maintain a competitive advantage.

We operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment, and new factors emerge from time to time that may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our success depends substantially on the value of our brands, and failure to preserve their value could negatively impact our financial results. Business incidents that erode consumer trust, such as breaches of privacy or food safety issues, can significantly reduce brand value and have a negative impact on our financial results. Our ability to ensure a clean water supply to our stores can be limited, particularly in some international locations, which poses a risk to our operational continuity. We rely heavily on information technology across our operations, and any material failure or security breach could adversely affect our ability to effectively operate our business and could negatively impact our financial results. We continue to make significant investments in technology and personnel to develop systems designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and minimize breaches of our information technology systems. Our financial performance is highly dependent on our Americas operating segment, and a slowdown in this segment could result in reduced cash flows for funding our international business expansion and other initiatives. We are increasingly dependent on the success of certain international markets to achieve our growth targets, and the performance of these operations may be adversely affected by economic downturns or other external pressures. Effective management of growth can be challenging, particularly as we expand into new channels and markets, and we must balance the need for flexibility with the need for consistency with our goals and standards. Our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel is critical to our success, and difficulties in recruiting and retaining employees could adversely impact our business and financial results. We face intense competition in each of our channels and markets, which could lead to reduced profitability. The specialty coffee market is intensely competitive, and we do not have leadership positions in all channels and markets. Our international operations are subject to various risks, including changes in economic, legal, regulatory, and political conditions, which could adversely affect our sales and results of operations. We expect to use our available cash and investments to invest in our core businesses and return cash to shareholders, while also considering strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and support our growth agenda. Our operational priorities include driving innovation, increasing digital engagement, and enabling long-term growth in key markets. We believe that future cash flows generated from operations, combined with our ability to leverage our balance sheet, will be sufficient to finance capital requirements and shareholder distributions. We are committed to maintaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and failure to do so could harm our business and financial results. Our policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws, and we routinely evaluate our compliance to ensure accurate and transparent reporting.

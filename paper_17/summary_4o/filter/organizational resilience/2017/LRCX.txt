The organizationâ€™s ability to attract, retain, and motivate key employees is critical for capitalizing on market opportunities and maintaining operational continuity, which are essential components of organizational resilience. This capability is influenced by various factors, including the competitiveness of compensation and benefit programs, global economic conditions, and the availability of career development opportunities. The organization periodically evaluates and adjusts its compensation and benefits to enhance their attractiveness, thereby supporting its strategic initiatives and overall organizational health. The emphasis on creating a challenging and rewarding work environment reflects an understanding of the need for adaptability and resilience in the face of external pressures and competitive talent markets. Failure to effectively manage these human resources could adversely affect operational results, indicating the interconnectedness of employee engagement and organizational performance under challenging conditions.

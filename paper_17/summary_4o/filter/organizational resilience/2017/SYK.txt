This report contains statements that are not historical facts and are considered "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations. We face uncertainties that might result from modification or repeal of any provisions of the Affordable Care Act, which could have a significant effect on our business. We are subject to extensive governmental regulation relating to the manufacturing, labeling, and marketing of our products, and failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may adversely impact our operational continuity. Our operations may be adversely affected by product liability claims, unfavorable court decisions, or legal settlements, which could impact our organizational resilience. We are exposed to potential product liability risks inherent in the design, manufacture, and marketing of medical devices. The medical device industry is characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation, which could divert management and operational personnel from other business issues and impact our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions. We operate in a highly competitive industry where competition in the development and improvement of new and existing products is significant, and our ability to maintain adequate working relationships with healthcare professionals is crucial for our organizational health. Our international operations are subject to additional risks and potential costs, including changes in reimbursement and regulatory requirements, which could affect our ability to adapt to complex situations. We may be unable to capitalize on previous or future acquisitions, and the risks associated with integrating new businesses could adversely affect our strategic initiatives. We rely extensively on information technology systems to conduct business, and failure of key IT systems or a cybersecurity breach could expose us to reputational and business harm. Our ability to manage the implementation of our new global enterprise resource planning system is critical for maintaining operational effectiveness. We must attract and retain key employees to meet our strategic business objectives, and interruptions in manufacturing operations could adversely affect our business continuity. We are reliant on certain suppliers for raw materials, components, and finished devices, and significant shortages or price increases could adversely impact our competitive position. Our financial condition reflects our ability to generate substantial cash from operations, which is essential for funding our operating needs and capital expenditures. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs, including acquisitions and recall-related payments, from a variety of sources. Future changes in the allocation of income to each of the income tax jurisdictions in which we operate could negatively impact our financial position. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, and the outcomes of ongoing legal proceedings may result in significant claims and settlements that could affect our operational resilience.

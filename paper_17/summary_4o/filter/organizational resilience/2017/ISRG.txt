The da Vinci surgical system and our other products represent a fundamentally new way of performing surgery, which requires achieving physician, patient, and third-party payor acceptance as a preferred method. The acceptance of our products by patients is essential for generating the revenue necessary to support our business. We expect that there will be a learning process involved for surgical teams to become proficient in the use of our products, and broad use will require training of surgical teams. Market acceptance could be delayed by the time required to complete this training. Economic conditions could materially adversely affect our company, and uncertainty about global economic conditions has caused and may continue to cause disruptions in financial credit markets, volatile currency exchange rates, and other adverse business conditions. Customers and distributors may choose to postpone or reduce spending due to financial difficulties or may be unable to obtain credit to finance purchases. Our business is closely tied to the overall U.S. healthcare system, which is subject to concerns and uncertainties due to ongoing health care reform initiatives. If economic conditions worsen or new legislation is passed related to the healthcare system, customer demand may not materialize to the levels required to achieve anticipated financial results. The competitive landscape is challenging, as customers may choose to purchase competitors' products or services, resulting in reduced revenue and loss of market share. Technological advances could render our products obsolete or unmarketable. We may not be able to maintain or improve our competitive position against current or potential competitors, especially those with greater resources. Our revenues may be reduced due to pricing pressure or eliminated if competitors develop and market more effective or less expensive products. We may not be able to rapidly train surgical teams in numbers sufficient to generate adequate demand for our products. Additionally, we face risks associated with our operations outside of the U.S., including failure to obtain or maintain the same degree of protection against infringement of our intellectual property rights, multiple regulatory requirements, and economic weakness in foreign markets. Natural disasters, terrorist activities, and other business disruptions could seriously harm our revenue and financial condition. If we do not successfully manage our collaboration arrangements, joint ventures, or partnerships with third parties, we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances. Our success depends on the quality and reliability of our products, and any defects discovered may result in additional unforeseen costs, loss of revenue, and damage to our reputation. We are subject to product liability claims, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and divert management's attention. Our ability to generate revenues is also dependent on the extent to which our products are eligible for coverage and reimbursement through government-sponsored healthcare payment systems and third-party payors. We are highly dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific staff, and competition for qualified personnel is intense. The loss of key personnel could harm our business and our ability to compete. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, and investment balances will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements beyond one year and for the foreseeable future.

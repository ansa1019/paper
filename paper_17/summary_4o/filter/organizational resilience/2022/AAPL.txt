The company's operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions, and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the company's business, results of operations, and financial condition. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting unprecedented measures in response, including restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine orders. Such measures have significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused substantial volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The company continues to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the company's operational and financial performance remains uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the company's control, including the emergence of new variants and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products and services. The company's business can also be impacted by political events, trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, and other business interruptions, which can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy. The company has a large, global business and believes it generally benefits from growth in international trade; however, trade policies and disputes can materially adversely affect the company's operations. The company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, and any business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate negative consequences. Major public health issues, including pandemics, have adversely affected the company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products, resulting in interruptions of supply and delays in production. The company's operations are subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers, and while suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments, accidents could disrupt the company's business and harm its reputation. The company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems regularly, which could impair the company's ability to attract and retain customers and materially damage commercial relationships. The company's business requires it to use and store confidential information, and losses or unauthorized access to such information could materially adversely affect the company's business, reputation, results of operations, and financial condition. The company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio, and the financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies. The company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand. The company's future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers, and the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends on developers' perceptions of the relative benefits of developing for the company's products compared to competitors. The company's distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success, and if the company is unable to nurture this culture, it could adversely affect its ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees critical to its success. The company's business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations, which can be expensive, time-consuming, and disruptive to operations. The company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes it to potential liabilities and increased costs.

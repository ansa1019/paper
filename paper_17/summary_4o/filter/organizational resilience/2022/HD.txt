Our business, results of operations, and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including strong competition that could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services, which may decrease our market share. The industry is highly competitive and evolving, requiring us to manage competitive pressures effectively to maintain operational flexibility and adapt to changing consumer preferences and expectations. We face challenges in identifying and responding promptly to evolving trends in demographics and unexpected conditions, such as public health issues and natural disasters, which could impact our customers and our ability to maintain an excellent customer experience. Our interconnected retail strategy relies on the coordinated operation of our network of physical stores, distribution facilities, and online platforms, which is fundamental to our success. Disruptions in our logistics or supply chain network, including those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected our ability to receive and deliver inventory in a timely manner, impairing our capacity to meet customer demand and resulting in lost sales. We must continually anticipate and adapt to changes in the shopping and purchasing process, including enhancing our online and in-store customer experience and delivery options. The execution of initiatives to expand our supply chain and enhance the interconnected shopping experience could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits. Our ability to attract, develop, and retain highly qualified associates is critical to providing excellent customer service and supporting our strategic initiatives. Labor market pressures, including increased wage rates and changing workforce expectations, may impair our ability to recruit and retain associates, which could adversely affect our operational effectiveness. We rely extensively on information technology systems to manage transactions and data, and any failure of these systems could disrupt our operations. Cybersecurity threats and the potential for data breaches pose significant risks to our organizational resilience, requiring us to continually evaluate and adapt our systems and processes to safeguard against unauthorized access and data loss. Our business is also subject to seasonal influences and significant weather conditions, which could impact operations and consumer spending. The long-term impacts of climate change present additional challenges, affecting the availability and cost of certain goods and services. We must manage relationships with suppliers effectively to ensure timely access to products that meet our quality standards. Failure to achieve and maintain high levels of product and service quality could damage our reputation and negatively impact our sales. Our strategic transactions involve risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition, and we must successfully integrate acquisitions to realize anticipated benefits. Overall, our ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions is contingent upon effective risk management, operational flexibility, and the capacity to adapt to external pressures and disruptions.

As a global payments technology company, we are subject to complex and evolving regulations that could harm our business and financial results. The impact of these regulations could limit our ability to enforce our payments system rules and require us to adopt new rules or change existing ones, affecting our existing contractual arrangements and increasing compliance costs. Our compliance programs are designed to support adherence to a wide array of regulations, and we continually adjust these programs as regulations evolve. However, we cannot guarantee compliance with all applicable regulatory authorities, and failures could result in monetary damages, civil and criminal penalties, and damage to our global brands and reputation. The evolving regulatory focus on the payments industry could negatively impact the number of products our clients issue, the volume of payments we process, and our competitive positioning. Increased scrutiny and regulation could harm our business, as regulators establish or increase their authority to regulate aspects of the payments industry. Changes to interchange reimbursement fees and operating rules, driven by regulatory actions, can substantially affect our payments volumes and revenues. The competitive landscape is intensely competitive, with emerging payment providers and government initiatives creating new challenges. We may face disintermediation due to technological changes and alternative payment methods, which could reduce our role in transactions. Our relationships with financial institutions, acquirers, and merchants are critical, and any failure in these relationships could harm our business and reputation. We depend on these relationships to maintain and expand the use of our products, and disruptions in these partnerships could negatively impact our operational continuity. The ongoing effects of geopolitical events, including sanctions and trade tensions, could adversely affect our business operations and financial results. The war in Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic have created uncertainties that could impact our revenues and operational effectiveness. Our ability to maintain liquidity is essential, and we regularly evaluate cash requirements for operations and capital expenditures. We have policies to manage liquidity risk and ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities. Our indemnification obligations expose us to significant risk of loss, and changes in the credit standing of our clients could negatively impact our financial position. Furthermore, our cybersecurity and processing systems face risks from errors, interruptions, and cyber-attacks, which could disrupt operations and harm our reputation. We are committed to maintaining a strong corporate culture that fosters innovation and collaboration, which is vital for our resilience in facing external pressures and challenges. Our strategic initiatives focus on adapting to regulatory changes, enhancing our operational flexibility, and ensuring business continuity in the face of adversity. We continuously assess our organizational capabilities and resilience strategies to navigate complex situations and maintain performance under pressure.

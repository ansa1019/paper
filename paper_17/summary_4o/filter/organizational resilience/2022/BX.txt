Difficult market and geopolitical conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways, which could materially reduce our revenue, earnings, and cash flow. We may not be able to manage our exposure to these conditions and events, which can reduce our ability to raise or deploy capital and realize value from existing investments. In the face of a difficult market or economic environment, we may need to reduce our fixed costs and other expenses to maintain profitability, including cutting back or eliminating certain services or terminating significant personnel, which could adversely affect our operating results. A failure to manage or reduce our costs within a sufficient time frame would adversely affect our operating performance. Economic slowdown or recession contributes to operating performance challenges for our funds' investments, which could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows. We have experienced periods of economic slowdown and contraction, as countries and industries grappled with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher interest rates could also result in economic slowdown and further deceleration in growth, contributing to poor financial results at our funds' portfolio companies. The performance of our funds' investments may be negatively impacted by inflation and rising input costs, which put pressure on profit margins. Market volatility and geopolitical concerns, including trade conflicts and severe public health events, have contributed and may continue to contribute to volatility in global equity and debt markets. A period of economic weakness may lead to declines in commodity prices and decreased consumer demand, adversely affecting our investments. Our funds' portfolio companies may face difficulties expanding their businesses or meeting debt obligations, potentially leading to bankruptcy proceedings and significant negative impacts on our performance and reputation. Negative market conditions could increase the risk of default with respect to investments held by our funds that have significant debt investments. We rely on our senior managing directors and key personnel for our success, and their loss could materially adversely affect our business. The asset management business is intensely competitive, and we may face increased competition from firms with greater resources or lower costs of capital. Our ability to raise capital from third-party investors depends on various factors, including economic conditions and investor perceptions. A decline in the pace of investment could adversely impact our revenues. We are subject to increasing scrutiny from regulators and stakeholders regarding environmental, social, and governance matters, which may affect our ability to raise capital and deploy investments. Our organizational structure and governance may also limit our ability to respond to changes in market conditions effectively. We must manage our liquidity and capital resources carefully to ensure we can meet our obligations and fund our operations. The performance of our investment funds is subject to significant variability, and poor performance could adversely affect our ability to raise new capital. Our investments in non-U.S. securities expose us to additional risks, including currency fluctuations and less developed financial markets. The success of our growth strategy depends on our ability to identify and integrate new investment opportunities effectively. We face risks related to the ownership and operation of real estate and infrastructure assets, including environmental liabilities and regulatory compliance. Our investment strategies may be impacted by changes in laws and regulations, including those related to climate change and sustainability.

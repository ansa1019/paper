Our operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition, including risks related to our global operations and the economic conditions of the specific markets in which we have concentrations of properties. We are subject to social, political, and economic risks of doing business in many countries, which can impact our ability to maintain operational continuity and adapt to unexpected situations. Disruptions in the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, potentially impacting our ability to make distributions and payments to security holders. We may be impacted by the ability of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to transfer cash among our subsidiaries due to currency exchange control regulations, which could hinder our resource allocation and operational flexibility. Additionally, we are required to comply with various regulations in different countries, and noncompliance could result in significant unanticipated expenditures, affecting our organizational health and resilience. 

Our investments are concentrated in the logistics sector, which may expose us to economic downturns in that sector to a greater extent than if our business activities were more diversified. We seek to minimize risks through geographic diversification and market research, but these risks cannot be entirely eliminated. We may face challenges in establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate operations in different geographies, which could impact our ability to adapt and respond to environmental perturbations. The potential impacts of future climate change could also adversely affect our ability to lease, develop, or sell properties, thereby affecting our organizational capabilities.

We depend on the deep industry knowledge and efforts of our executive officers and key employees, and any loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business. Our ability to generate cash from operating activities and access external sources of capital is critical for maintaining our operational resilience. We evaluate our business operations based on the net operating income of our segments, which helps us understand our operating results and performance under pressure. 

In the event of system failures or cybersecurity attacks, our operations could be materially disrupted, leading to additional costs to remedy damages. We are exposed to various environmental risks, which may result in unanticipated losses that could affect our business and financial condition. Our organizational practices include maintaining sufficient influence over our co-investment ventures to achieve our business objectives, although there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so indefinitely. 

We continuously assess our ability to recover investments in real estate assets and manage risks associated with our capital deployment activities. Our strategic initiatives include focusing on build-to-suit developments and evaluating capital deployment activities in light of current market conditions. We believe we are well-positioned to grow revenues organically, but we will remain cautious as we navigate the uncertain environment, ensuring that we can confront and adapt to challenges while maintaining our organizational resilience.

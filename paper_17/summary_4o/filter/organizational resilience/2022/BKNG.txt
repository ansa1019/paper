Our business and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties, including adverse changes in market conditions for travel services, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for effective crisis management and operational flexibility. We have experienced volatility in transaction growth rates and increased cancellation rates during periods of perceived or actual adverse economic conditions. The uncertainty of macroeconomic factors and their impact on consumer behavior complicates our ability to effectively manage our business and forecast our financial performance. Other events beyond our control, such as extreme weather, natural disasters, and geopolitical tensions, may disrupt travel and limit consumer willingness to travel, which could adversely affect our business. Our ability to adapt to changes in how the travel industry operates or to changes in consumer purchasing behavior is critical for maintaining competitive advantage. We face intense competition from both online and traditional travel services, which requires us to continually innovate and enhance our service offerings to meet evolving consumer needs. The rapid pace of technological and market changes necessitates that we remain agile and responsive to maintain our market position. Our long-term strategy involves continued expansion and improvement of our service offerings, which may require significant investment and could impact our profit margins in the short term. We are also reliant on our relationships with travel service providers, and any significant reduction in their participation could materially affect our market share and results of operations. The integration of acquired businesses and the optimization of collaboration among our brands are essential for achieving our strategic objectives. As we pursue our connected trip vision, we must effectively manage the complexity of our operations and ensure that our systems and processes can support growth. Our reliance on third-party service providers further emphasizes the importance of maintaining robust risk management practices to mitigate potential disruptions. The evolving regulatory landscape presents additional challenges, as compliance with various laws and regulations can increase operational burdens and costs. We are committed to enhancing our organizational resilience by investing in technology and human capital to adapt to changing market conditions and consumer preferences. Our focus on building a diverse and skilled workforce is critical for fostering innovation and maintaining operational continuity. The ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to shape our operational landscape, and our ability to navigate these challenges will be vital for our long-term success. We must remain vigilant in assessing risks and opportunities to ensure that we can sustain our performance and achieve our strategic goals in an increasingly complex and competitive environment.

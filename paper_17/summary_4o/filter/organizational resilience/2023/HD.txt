Our business, results of operations, and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including the ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from challenging situations. The competitive landscape is highly fragmented and evolving, requiring us to adapt effectively and quickly to changes, which is critical for maintaining operational flexibility and ensuring business continuity. We face intense competitive pressures that could adversely affect our prices, margins, and demand for our products and services. The ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics and consumer preferences is essential for maintaining our market share and organizational health. Our interconnected retail strategy is fundamental to enhancing the customer shopping experience and requires continual investment in operations and technology, which is vital for resilience against external pressures and operational disruptions. 

Disruptions within our logistics or supply chain network, such as those experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected our ability to meet customer demand and could result in lost sales and increased costs. We must effectively manage our relationships with suppliers to ensure timely access to products that meet our quality standards. The ability to maintain a safe and secure store environment is critical for protecting our brand and reputation, as negative incidents can erode trust and confidence among customers and associates. Our reliance on information technology systems to manage operations introduces risks, including potential failures that could disrupt our business and impair data security. 

The changing regulatory environment related to data privacy and cybersecurity requires us to adapt our practices continuously, which is essential for maintaining stakeholder trust and organizational resilience. Our operational success depends on attracting, developing, and retaining qualified associates to provide excellent customer service and support strategic initiatives. The ability to manage labor costs while meeting customer expectations is influenced by external factors, including market pressures and public health concerns. 

We are also subject to various legal, regulatory, and governmental enforcement proceedings that could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. The impacts of climate change and other catastrophic events could disrupt our operations and affect consumer behavior, necessitating a proactive approach to risk management and adaptation strategies. Our financial performance is significantly influenced by the stability of the housing and home improvement markets, and adverse conditions could lead to decreased demand for our products and services. 

In summary, our ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions is contingent upon effective resource management, strategic foresight, and operational agility, all of which are essential for navigating the complexities of the current business environment.

This report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that involve certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Our business is subject to various risks, including those related to government regulations, economic conditions, and operational disruptions. Significant disruptions or production failures at our facilities could significantly impair our ability to supply our products or continue our clinical trials. We rely on third-party suppliers for certain raw materials, medical devices, and components necessary for manufacturing, and any adverse developments at these suppliers could negatively affect our operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies may not be successful and could result in unanticipated costs or delays. The effects of global climate change and related natural disasters could negatively affect our business and operations, as many of our facilities are in locations subject to such risks. We have detailed business continuity plans in place and conduct periodic assessments of our natural disaster risk, but any natural disaster may result in prolonged interruption to our critical operational activities. Our business activities outside the United States are subject to various geopolitical risks, including international sanctions and political instability, which could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. We continuously monitor the impacts of health-related events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, on our clinical trial activities and operational capabilities. Our organizational practices are designed to foster resilience and adaptability in the face of external pressures and operational challenges. We maintain a focus on achieving our environmental, social, and governance objectives, which are increasingly scrutinized by stakeholders. Failure to meet these objectives could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business. Our operational flexibility is essential for navigating the complexities of the competitive landscape, and we are committed to strategic initiatives that enhance our resilience against disruptive changes. The consolidation of private payers and wholesalers has increased pressure on our pricing and sales strategies, necessitating a proactive approach to resource management and operational continuity. We are also subject to risks related to litigation and government investigations, which can divert management's attention and resources. Our ability to respond effectively to these challenges is critical for maintaining organizational health and achieving our strategic objectives. We have invested in systems and processes that support our operational resilience, including cybersecurity measures to protect our information technology systems from potential disruptions. Our commitment to innovation and collaboration is integral to our organizational strategy, enabling us to adapt to changing market conditions and customer needs. As we continue to expand our operations, particularly in emerging markets, we face numerous risks that could impact our ability to achieve our business objectives. Our strategic planning includes considerations for future uncertainties and the need for agility in our operational management. The interplay of these factors underscores the importance of maintaining a resilient organizational framework capable of withstanding external disturbances and fostering long-term success.

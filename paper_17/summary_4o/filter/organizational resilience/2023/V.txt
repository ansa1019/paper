We are subject to complex and evolving global regulations that could harm our business and financial results, impacting our ability to enforce our payments system rules and requiring us to adopt new rules or change existing ones. Complying with these regulations increases our costs and reduces our revenue opportunities, and if widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide, we may have difficulty rapidly adjusting our product offerings and services. Our compliance programs are designed to support adherence to a wide array of regulations, and we continually adjust them as regulations evolve. However, we cannot guarantee that our practices will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities. The evolving regulatory focus on the payments industry could negatively impact the number of Visa products our clients issue and the volume of payments we process, affecting our revenues and competitive positioning. Increased scrutiny and regulation of the global payments industry, including aspects such as interchange reimbursement fees and risk management protocols, could harm our business. The risks created by new laws or regulatory outcomes have the potential to negatively affect our business across jurisdictions. We face intense competition in the global payments space, where technology evolves rapidly, and new competitors or payment methods emerge. Our products compete with various payment forms, and we must adapt to technological changes and the proliferation of alternative payment services to maintain our competitive advantage. The competitive landscape is shifting, and we may not be able to foresee or respond sufficiently to emerging risks associated with new businesses and practices. We depend on relationships with financial institutions, acquirers, processors, merchants, and other third parties to support our programs and services. Our success increasingly relies on our ability to sustain and grow these relationships. The global economic, political, market, health, and social events may harm our business, as adverse macroeconomic conditions can directly impact our transaction volumes and revenues. The ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical events have introduced uncertainties that could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. We are also subject to laws and regulations regarding data handling and privacy, which may impede our services or result in increased costs. Our business relies on the movement of data across national borders, and the evolving legal environment creates an uncertain regulatory landscape. We face challenges in attracting and retaining a highly qualified workforce, which is vital to our success. Failure to meet workforce development goals could impact our ability to achieve business objectives. Our brand reputation is crucial, and various factors, including compliance failures and data security breaches, could negatively impact it. We continuously monitor and manage risks from clients in our portfolio, including their settlement obligations. Our indemnification obligations expose us to significant risk of loss, which may reduce our liquidity. We maintain policies to manage settlement risk, which may require clients to post collateral if credit standards are not met. The complexity of our operations and the need to adapt to regulatory changes and competitive pressures highlight the importance of organizational resilience in maintaining operational continuity and achieving strategic objectives.

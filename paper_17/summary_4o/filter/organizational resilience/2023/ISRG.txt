The global economic environment and unforeseen effects from COVID-19 amplify many risks, impacting our business, financial condition, and future results of operations. Macroeconomic conditions, such as high inflationary pressure, changes to monetary policy, and geopolitical instability, could materially adversely affect our business. Hospitals are experiencing financial and operational pressures due to staffing shortages and high inflation, which could impede their ability to provide patient care and impact their profitability. If hospitals face financial pressures or higher interest rates, their willingness to spend on capital equipment may be adversely affected. The uncertainty surrounding macroeconomic conditions may lead to reduced demand for our products and services. Our operations outside of the U.S. are subject to various risks, including changes in tariffs, trade barriers, and regulatory requirements, which could slow our growth in international markets. The ongoing conflict in Ukraine and military hostilities in the Middle East could disrupt supply chains and increase costs, further complicating our operational flexibility. We are actively monitoring these situations and assessing their impacts on our business. Our ability to adapt to these challenges is critical, as we face competition from companies that develop robotic-assisted medical systems. The introduction of new products and technologies is essential for maintaining our competitive position, and we invest substantially in research and development to support this goal. Our focus on innovation and service optimization aims to enhance our operational resilience and ensure business continuity. We have developed mechanisms to mitigate risks associated with supply chain disruptions, including increasing communications with suppliers and modifying purchase order coverage. Our installed base of da Vinci surgical systems continues to grow, reflecting increased procedure adoption and customer validation of robotic-assisted surgery. However, we recognize the need for ongoing adaptation to changing market conditions and customer needs. The successful execution of our strategic initiatives, including collaborations and partnerships, is vital for achieving our long-term objectives. We are committed to maintaining operational flexibility and resilience in the face of external pressures and uncertainties. Our organizational practices emphasize the importance of knowledge management and internal collaboration to enhance our adaptability and responsiveness to unexpected situations. We believe that fostering a culture of learning and innovation will strengthen our organizational capabilities and support our strategic resilience. The ability to foresee and confront challenges, along with effective resource allocation and management, will be crucial for our survival and success in a competitive landscape. We continuously evaluate our operational strategies and performance under pressure to ensure that we are well-positioned to navigate the complexities of the healthcare environment.

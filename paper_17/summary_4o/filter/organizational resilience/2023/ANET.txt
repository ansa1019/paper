Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including adverse economic conditions and the potential for supply shortages, which could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. We expect large purchases by a limited number of customers to continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenue, and any loss, delay, decline, or other change in expected purchases could result in material quarter-to-quarter fluctuations of our revenue. The unpredictability in the timing of orders from large customers is primarily due to the complexity of these orders and changes in demand patterns, including reductions in capital expenditures and the impact of cost reduction efforts by these customers. The networking market is rapidly evolving, and failure to successfully carry out new products and service offerings could adversely impact our business. We face risks associated with the expansion of our international sales and operations, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates could also adversely affect our business. 

We have experienced volatility in demand from certain large customers, and some of these customers have announced various cost reduction measures or are considering changing technology roadmaps and priorities, including the need for the rapid deployment of AI and related technologies. This has reduced our visibility to demand and may result in reductions in overall demand from these customers in future periods. The global macroeconomic environment has been negatively affected by geopolitical tensions, which may contribute to uncertainty and instability in local economies and financial markets. 

We regularly maintain cash balances that are not insured or are in excess of the FDIC's insurance limit, and any delay in our ability to access cash or to timely pay key vendors could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Business disruptions and supply chain and manufacturing disruptions may result in customers delaying or canceling capital expenditures, affecting overall demand for our products. Our reliance on third-party manufacturers exposes us to operational risks, including their ability to ramp manufacturing to meet customer demand. 

We are also subject to risks associated with the development and use of artificial intelligence, which may result in reputational harm, liability, or other adverse consequences to our business operations. The successful assertion of claims against us regarding intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business. 

We must continue to enhance our existing products and develop new technologies that address emerging trends and changing end-customer needs. Our ability to manage our supply chain effectively is critical, as insufficient component supply and inventory may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue. The complexity of managing our manufacturing capacity and extended supply chain may hinder our ability to forecast accurately and effectively manage the supply of our products. 

In addition, we face intense competition, and our success depends on our ability to continue to evolve and adapt to a rapidly changing environment. We have made significant investments to develop new products and services and enhancements to existing products, and if we fail to successfully carry out these initiatives, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely impacted.

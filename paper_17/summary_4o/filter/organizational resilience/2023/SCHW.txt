We face a variety of risks that may affect our operations, financial results, or stock price, driven by factors beyond our control or prediction. Developments in the business, economic, and geopolitical environment could negatively impact our business, affecting client asset valuations and trading activity. Our business can be adversely affected by the general environment, including economic and regulatory developments. A significant change in client cash allocations could negatively impact our income, as we rely heavily on client cash balances to generate revenue. To facilitate changes in client cash allocations, we have utilized higher-cost supplemental funding sources, which has negatively impacted our net income. Maintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to our business operations, including transaction settlement and lending commitments. A significant decrease in our liquidity could reduce client confidence, potentially resulting in the transfer of client assets and accounts. We are required to deposit cash and securities for margin requirements and clearing funds, which may fluctuate significantly based on clients' trading activity and market volatility. Our systems are vulnerable to disruptions from human error, technological failure, and external events, which could negatively impact our business and operations. Despite our efforts to manage these risks, we may not be able to prevent unexpected losses or reputational damage. We have established a comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage these risks, including operational, compliance, credit, market, and liquidity risks. Our risk management process involves risk identification and assessment, response, measurement, monitoring, and reporting. We maintain a backup and recovery infrastructure to ensure operational continuity during incidents. Our operations are highly dependent on the integrity and resilience of our critical business functions and technology systems. We have specific policies to manage operational risk, including fraud risk arising from theft of financial assets. We also face compliance risk related to legal or regulatory sanctions and reputational damage. Our exposure to credit risk results from various activities, including margin lending and securities lending. We have established policies to manage credit risk, including setting and reviewing credit limits and monitoring counterparty quality. Market risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates and equity prices, and we manage this risk through established policies and procedures. We conduct regular liquidity stress testing to ensure our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity during market-related or company-specific liquidity stress events. Our liquidity policies support the execution of business strategies while ensuring ongoing liquidity to meet operational needs. We seek to maintain client confidence in our balance sheet by ensuring liquidity and diversity of funding sources. Our capital management strategy includes maintaining sufficient capital levels to support business strategies, including balance sheet growth and regulatory requirements. We conduct regular capital stress testing to assess potential financial impacts of adverse events. Our capital contingency plan provides guidelines for responding to low probability/high impact capital events. We continuously monitor our capital levels and requirements to ensure compliance with regulatory standards.

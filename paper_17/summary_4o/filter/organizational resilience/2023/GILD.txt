In evaluating our business, we note that our operations could be affected by factors, events, or uncertainties that may not be presently known or considered significant risks. The successful commercialization of our products depends, in part, on the availability and amount of third-party payer reimbursement for our products and related treatments. Our success depends on developing and commercializing new products or expanding the indications for existing products. We face challenges in accurately forecasting sales due to difficulties in predicting demand for our products and fluctuations in purchasing patterns. Our operations are subject to significant competition from global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and adverse changes in economic conditions may cause retail pharmacies to reduce their inventories of our products. We have observed variations in purchasing patterns induced by cost containment measures in Europe, which may continue to trend in the future. Our reliance on third-party sites for logistical collection and delivery of products introduces risks that could result in product loss and regulatory action. We face risks associated with our clinical trials, including potential unfavorable results and delays in anticipated timelines. We are required to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of product candidates through extensive studies, and the results from these studies do not always predict outcomes in later trials. Our operations depend on compliance with complex regulations, and failure to maintain compliance could delay or halt commercialization of our products. We are subject to various legal actions, and adverse developments could result in significant expenses or penalties. Our business has been adversely affected by outbreaks of contagious diseases, which can significantly disrupt our global operations. We face risks associated with our global operations, including foreign currency exchange and fluctuations in interest rates and inflation. Climate change and related natural disasters can negatively affect our business and operations, as many of our facilities are located in regions subject to such risks. Our suppliers and third-party manufacturers face similar risks, and any disruption to their operations could adversely affect our manufacturing and supply chain. We depend on relationships with third parties for sales and marketing performance, and failure to maintain these relationships could negatively impact our business. The failure to attract, develop, and retain highly qualified personnel could adversely impact us, as our future success depends on our ability to maintain a strong workplace culture. We periodically implement or upgrade new enterprise resource planning and other information systems, and if we do not successfully implement these systems, we may experience operational difficulties. Information system service interruptions or breaches could give rise to legal liability and regulatory action. Cybersecurity incidents are increasing in frequency and sophistication, and we may continue to be the target of such incidents. Our ability to achieve our goals and objectives related to environmental, social, and governance matters is subject to numerous risks, including the evolving regulatory landscape. We may require additional funding in the future, and if such funding is required, we cannot guarantee that it will be available on favorable terms. Our future capital requirements will depend on various factors, including the commercial performance of our products and the progress of our research and development efforts.

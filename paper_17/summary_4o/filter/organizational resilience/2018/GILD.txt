In evaluating our business, it is essential to consider various risks that could materially and adversely affect our operations and financial condition. A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales of products to treat HIV and HCV, and any inability to increase sales or a decline in these sales could necessitate scaling back operations, including future drug development and research efforts. Our revenues from HCV products have become more predictable, yet we anticipate a decline in product sales due to lower patient starts and competitive pressures. Future sales depend significantly on reimbursement levels from private and public payers, and global pricing pressures may result in larger discounts or rebates, adversely impacting our product sales. We also face significant competition from global pharmaceutical companies, which requires us to maintain operational flexibility and adaptability in our strategies. The introduction of new branded or generic products and the need to commercialize new products are critical for sustaining revenues. Our operations are subject to various legislative and regulatory actions that could impact our business, necessitating a proactive approach to risk management and strategic response. We continually assess our research and development pipeline and reallocate resources to support future growth. The successful commercialization of our products is contingent upon the availability of governmental and third-party payer reimbursement, and we must navigate complex pricing and reimbursement pressures that could reduce profitability. Our reliance on collaborative relationships with third parties for sales and marketing performance poses risks, including the potential for disputes that could delay product development or commercialization. Furthermore, our operations are vulnerable to business interruptions from natural or man-made disasters, which could harm future revenues. We depend on information technology systems that may be subject to cyberattacks, and any breaches could result in significant financial and reputational harm. Our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel is vital for successful product development and commercialization, and competition for talent in the biopharmaceutical field is intense. We also face risks related to our manufacturing processes, as any disruptions could impair our ability to deliver products on time. The complexity of our operations necessitates a robust approach to event management and crisis response. Our financial condition is influenced by various factors, including the commercial performance of our products, the progress of our R&D efforts, and the establishment of additional collaborative relationships. We must remain vigilant in assessing external pressures and adapting our strategies to ensure organizational resilience and long-term success in a competitive landscape.

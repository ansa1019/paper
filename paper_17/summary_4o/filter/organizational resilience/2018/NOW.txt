Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk, and we have identified various risks and uncertainties that may materially affect our business and financial condition. The markets for our enterprise cloud solutions are rapidly evolving and highly competitive, which may impact our competitive position and business prospects. If we do not accurately predict, prepare for, and respond promptly to rapidly evolving technological, market, and customer developments, our competitive position may be harmed. Global economic conditions may also adversely affect our industry and results of operations. Our operations involve the storage, transmission, and processing of confidential customer data, and any cybersecurity event could result in significant liabilities and harm our business. We devote significant resources to implement and maintain security measures, but as cyber threats evolve, we may need to invest further to protect data and infrastructure. Natural disasters and other catastrophic events could disrupt our operations and negatively affect our ability to deliver services. Although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could lead to substantial expenses and operational challenges. Our business depends on the successful implementation of our products by customers, and various factors may cause implementations to be delayed or unsuccessful, which could harm our reputation and business. We rely on our network of partners for a portion of our revenues, and if these partners fail to perform, our ability to sell and distribute our products may be limited. Our ability to attract and retain key personnel is critical to our success, and changes in our management team could disrupt our business. Compliance with evolving regulations, including data privacy laws, may impose additional burdens and operational costs. We recognize the importance of maintaining operational flexibility and adaptability in response to market changes and customer needs. Our financial results may vary significantly from period to period, and if we fail to meet the financial performance expectations of investors, our stock price could decline substantially. The occurrence of payment delays or service disruptions could result in increased expenses and risks of litigation. We face risks related to government contracting, including compliance with complex laws and regulations, which could adversely affect our business. Our success depends on our ability to innovate and respond effectively to environmental disruptions and changes in customer requirements. We are committed to investing in our capacity to support anticipated growth, but these investments may not yield the expected benefits. Our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage risks associated with foreign markets and international operations. We must continue to develop our services and infrastructure to drive long-term growth and maintain our competitive advantage in a rapidly changing environment.

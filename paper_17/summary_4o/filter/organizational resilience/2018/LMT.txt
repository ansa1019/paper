A key component of our strategic plan is to grow our international sales, which involves strengthening our relationships internationally through partnerships and joint technology efforts. We conduct business with international customers through each of our business segments, and international customers accounted for a significant percentage of net sales. The ongoing international commitment to programs such as the F-35 demonstrates our ability to adapt to external pressures and maintain operational flexibility. Our business segments continue to generate significant international interest, particularly in air and missile defense systems, which reflects our capability to respond to customer needs and market demands. We have ongoing programs for production and sustainment activities that require effective resource allocation and risk assessment to ensure successful outcomes. 

We have experienced performance matters in certain programs, which necessitate adjustments to our estimates of total costs and revenue recognition. The ability to foresee and confront challenges in these programs is indicative of our organizational resilience, as we continuously monitor program requirements and performance. Our operational management practices include identifying and mitigating risks associated with technical, schedule, and cost aspects of contracts, which is essential for maintaining performance under pressure. 

The consolidation of our joint ventures and the strategic initiatives undertaken to improve efficiency and align our organization with changing economic conditions are examples of our commitment to organizational transformation. We expect to recover a portion of severance and restructuring charges through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government and other customers in future periods, which reflects our proactive measures to ensure business continuity. 

Our investment in research and development is aimed at enhancing our capabilities and ensuring we remain competitive in a turbulent market. The strategic foresight demonstrated in our financial planning and resource management is critical for sustaining our operations and achieving our major objectives. We have a balanced cash deployment strategy to enhance stockholder value while positioning ourselves to take advantage of new business opportunities. 

The ongoing evaluation of our internal controls and risk management practices ensures that we maintain the integrity of our operations. We have established a robust framework for assessing the impact of environmental regulations and other external disturbances on our business. Our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and regulatory environments is essential for our long-term success and organizational health. 

Overall, our organizational practices reflect a commitment to resilience through effective resource generation, operational continuity, and the ability to navigate complex situations. Our focus on collaboration networks and inter-organizational cooperation enhances our organizational strength and agility, allowing us to thrive in an ever-evolving business landscape.

The company’s inability to successfully recover should it experience a disaster or other business continuity or data recovery problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, or legal liability. If the company experiences a local or regional disaster or other business continuity event, such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood, terrorist attack, pandemic, security breach, cyber-attack, power loss, or telecommunications failure, its ability to operate will depend, in part, on the continued availability of personnel, office facilities, and the proper functioning of computer, telecommunication, and other related systems and operations. The risk of business disruption is more pronounced in certain geographic areas, including major metropolitan centers, where significant operations are located. The company regularly assesses and takes steps to improve its existing business continuity, disaster recovery, and data recovery plans and key management succession. However, a disaster or other continuity event on a significant scale could materially interrupt business operations and result in material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, and legal liability. The company’s operations depend in particular upon its ability to protect its technology infrastructure against damage. A cyber-attack or other business continuity event affecting the company or a key vendor could result in significant and extended disruption in the functioning of information technology systems or operations or the ability to recover data, requiring the company to incur significant expense to address and remediate or otherwise resolve such issues. The company faces the ongoing challenge of managing access controls in a complex environment, and the latency of a compromise is often measured in months but could be years, making timely detection difficult. The company’s reliance on the efficient, uninterrupted, and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks is critical for securely processing, transmitting, and storing electronic information. The company may not be able to protect all of its data across its diverse systems, and the competition for talent in the data privacy and cybersecurity space is intense, which may hinder its ability to adequately detect, mitigate, or remediate these risks. The company’s information systems must be continually updated, patched, and upgraded to protect against known vulnerabilities, and the increased frequency at which vendors issue security patches presents a substantial risk that the company cannot deploy patches in a timely manner. The company’s operations are also subject to significant uninsured exposures arising from errors and omissions, breach of fiduciary duty, and other claims, which could divert personnel and management resources. The company’s business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if it is unable to respond effectively to the threat of digital disruption and other technological change. To maintain a competitive position, the company must continue to upgrade its legacy operating technology and invest in new technologies and new ways to deliver its products and services. The company’s success in this regard will depend on its ability to identify and compete for appropriate acquisition candidates and to complete transactions with favorable results. The company’s ability to adapt to changing conditions is critical for its business continuity and resilience strategies, which are essential for maintaining operational flexibility and achieving major objectives in a competitive landscape.

We operate in an increasingly competitive and rapidly changing environment. Economic conditions in the U.S. and international markets could adversely affect our business and financial results. Our results of operations are sensitive to changes in or uncertainty about macro-economic conditions. Our success depends substantially on the value of our brands and failure to preserve their value could have a negative impact on our financial results. Business incidents that erode consumer trust can significantly reduce brand value and have a negative impact on our financial results. We believe customers expect the same quality of products and service from our licensed-store operators as they do from us, and we strive to ensure customers receive the same quality of products and service experience. Incidents involving food or beverage-borne illnesses could harm our business, and any report linking us to such issues could damage our brand value. We face risks by relying on third-party food suppliers, and our ability to ensure a clean supply can be limited, particularly in some international locations. We continue to incorporate more products that require refrigeration, and we face risks from relying on suppliers who may not have rigorous quality systems. If customers become ill from food safety issues, we could be forced to temporarily close stores or recall products. Our financial performance is sensitive to a number of factors, including severe weather or other natural or man-made disasters affecting our retail business. Interruption of our supply chain could negatively impact our business and profitability. Any material interruption in our supply chain could have a negative material impact on our business. We rely heavily on information technology in our operations, and any material failure or security failure of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate and grow our business. We may not be successful in implementing important strategic initiatives or effectively managing growth, which may have an adverse impact on our business and financial results. Our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate operations depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of our systems. We face intense competition in each of our channels and markets, which could lead to reduced profitability. Our financial performance is highly dependent on our Americas operating segment, and a slowdown in this segment could adversely affect our business. We are increasingly dependent on the success of certain international markets to achieve our growth targets. Our future growth increasingly depends on sustained profitability in these markets, which may be adversely affected by economic downturns. We are exposed to risks in international markets, including changes in economic conditions, regulatory reform, and competition. We may face challenges in staffing, developing, and managing foreign operations. Our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel is critical to our success, and failure to do so could adversely impact our business. We must continue to recruit, retain, and motivate management and other employees to maintain our current business and execute our strategic initiatives. Our policies and procedures are designed to comply with applicable laws, and failure to comply could harm our business and financial results.

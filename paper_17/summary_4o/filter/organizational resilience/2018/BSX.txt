Our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by various risks, including intense competition and rapid technological changes in the medical devices industry, which necessitate continuous efforts and resource allocation to develop or acquire scientifically advanced technologies and products. We face significant competition across our product lines, which may impact our ability to maintain market share and operational flexibility. The healthcare industry is characterized by extensive research and development and rapid technological change, requiring us to adapt to environmental perturbations and external pressures. We continue to experience pressures due to competitive activity, increased market power of our customers, and economic pressures, which may adversely impact market sizes and our share of the markets in which we compete.

Our international operations are subject to various market, business, financial, legal, and regulatory risks that could materially impact our business. These include geopolitical instability, foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and changes in healthcare financing and delivery systems, which may affect our ability to implement growth strategies in these markets. The evolving regulatory environment for medical devices may impede our ability to obtain necessary approvals, which could adversely affect our market position and operational continuity.

We are committed to enhancing our operational effectiveness and efficiency through restructuring and optimization initiatives aimed at improving our growth potential. These initiatives may yield unintended consequences, such as distraction of management and employees, business disruption, and reduced employee productivity. Our restructuring plans are designed to ensure that we are appropriately structured and resourced to deliver sustainable value to patients and customers.

The ability to manage our debt levels and maintain investment-grade credit ratings is critical to our financial health. Disruptions in cash flows could adversely affect our cost of borrowing and overall financial condition. We are also subject to extensive and dynamic medical device regulation, which may hinder the approval or sale of our products and result in significant delays and costs. Compliance with regulatory requirements is essential for maintaining our operational integrity and effectiveness.

Our future growth depends on our ability to develop new products and enhance existing products, which requires significant investment in research and development. The results of these efforts may be influenced by our ability to anticipate customer needs and innovate effectively. We must also navigate the complexities of integrating acquired businesses and managing the associated risks to achieve synergies and maintain operational effectiveness.

We recognize the importance of organizational resilience in responding to unexpected situations and maintaining performance under pressure. Our strategic initiatives are focused on fostering adaptability and operational flexibility to confront challenges and capitalize on opportunities in a rapidly changing market environment. The ability to reconfigure our strategies and resources in response to disruptive events is vital for sustaining our competitive advantage and ensuring long-term success.

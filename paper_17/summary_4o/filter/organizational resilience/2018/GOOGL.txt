Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including intense competition and the need to innovate and provide relevant products and services. Competing successfully depends heavily on our ability to accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant, and useful products, services, and technologies to the marketplace in a timely manner. As our businesses evolve, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products and services, necessitating significant investment in research and development. Our ongoing investment in new businesses and technologies is inherently risky and could disrupt our current operations. The creation of Alphabet as a holding company reflects our efforts to innovate and provide useful products and services. We face risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management, which could affect our ability to supply both products and services. Our business could be negatively affected if we are unable to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or if those we engage fail to meet their obligations. We may experience supply shortages and price increases driven by various factors, including natural disasters and the effects of climate change. Our international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business, including restrictions on foreign ownership, evolving foreign laws, and different employee/employer relationships. Changes in international local political, economic, regulatory, tax, social, and labor conditions may also harm our business. We are subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny, which may negatively affect our business and results of operations. Our ability to continue to attract and retain users and customers is critical to our success, as is our ability to monetize traffic on Google properties. Our performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals, and competition for qualified employees is intense. Our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork, which are essential for our success. We expect to continue investing in our employees and maintaining our corporate culture as we grow. Our success will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality, innovative products and services. We face various risks related to intellectual property, including claims that could limit our ability to use certain technologies. Our business depends on strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our ability to expand our user base. We rely on third parties to manufacture many of our products, and disruptions in our supply chain could negatively affect our operations. We expect to continue to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of products and services across multiple platforms and devices. Our revenue growth rate could decline over time due to various factors, including increasing competition and the continued expansion of our business into new fields. Our operating results may fluctuate, making them difficult to predict. We are regularly subject to claims, suits, and government investigations that may adversely affect our business. Our products and services involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information, and security breaches could result in significant legal and financial exposure. We expect to continue to expend significant resources to maintain state-of-the-art security protections.

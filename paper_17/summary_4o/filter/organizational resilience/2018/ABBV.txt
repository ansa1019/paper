Abbvie's strategy has focused on delivering strong financial results, advancing and investing in its pipeline, and ensuring a strong, sustainable growth business over the long term. The company commits substantial effort, funds, and other resources to research and development and must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. A high rate of failure in the biopharmaceutical industry is inherent in the research and development of new products, and failure can occur at any point in the research and development process. Decisions about research studies made early in the development process can affect the marketing strategy once a product candidate receives approval. Abbvie's innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace due to existing clinical practices or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. The expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may adversely affect Abbvie's future revenues and operating earnings, leading to competition from lower-priced generic or biosimilar products. Abbvie relies on patent, trademark, and other intellectual property protection in the discovery, development, manufacturing, and sale of its products, which is crucial for maintaining its competitive advantage. The company faces risks associated with doing business internationally, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in medical reimbursement policies, which could restrict Abbvie's ability to manufacture, market, and sell its products. The successful discovery, development, manufacturing, and sale of biologics is a long, expensive, and uncertain process, and there are unique risks and uncertainties associated with biologics. Problems may arise during manufacturing for various reasons, including equipment malfunction and regulatory requirements, which could lead to increased costs, lost revenue, and damage to customer relations. Abbvie's dependence on wholesale distributors for distribution of its products in the United States means that its results of operations could be adversely affected if these distributors encounter financial difficulties. The company monitors economic conditions, the creditworthiness of customers, and government regulations, which may require periodic re-evaluation of the collectability of its receivables. Abbvie's ability to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt, or enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected by material declines in demand for its products or other unfavorable changes in business conditions. The company has a pipeline of promising new medicines in clinical development, and its long-term success depends on its ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products. Abbvie's mission is to be an innovation-driven, patient-focused specialty biopharmaceutical company capable of achieving top-tier financial performance through outstanding execution and a consistent stream of innovative new medicines. The company anticipates several regulatory submissions and key data readouts from key clinical trials, which are essential for maintaining operational continuity and adapting to market demands. The effective management of Abbvie's intellectual property rights and the ability to respond to competitive pressures are critical for the company's resilience and long-term sustainability.

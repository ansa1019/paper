We operate in rapidly changing economic and technological environments that present numerous risks, many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict. Economic, political, and market conditions can adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability. Our business is influenced by a range of factors beyond our control, including general economic and business conditions, overall demand for enterprise software, governmental budgetary constraints, and general political developments. Political unrest and potential public health crises contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertainty that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We may fail to achieve our financial forecasts due to inaccurate sales forecasts or other factors, and our revenues, particularly from new software licenses and hardware systems, are difficult to forecast. A reduction in the conversion rate of our sales pipeline could adversely affect our business or results of operations. Our cloud computing strategy may not be successful, and we may not be able to compete effectively, generate significant revenues, or maintain profitability. We continue to invest in research and development to enhance our existing portfolio of products and services and to develop new products and services. Our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and services, integrate acquired products and services, and enhance our existing offerings. Rapid technological advances and evolving standards characterize the industries in which we compete. If we are unable to develop new or sufficiently differentiated products and services or enhance our existing offerings in a timely manner, customers may not purchase or renew our software, hardware, or cloud offerings. Our cloud offerings are designed to be attractive and cost-effective options for our customers, and we believe that our investments in cloud computing are essential to maintaining our competitive position. We have also simplified our supply chain processes by reducing the number of third-party manufacturing partners and locations, which has made us more dependent on fewer partners. Our reliance on these third parties reduces our control over the manufacturing and delivery process, exposing us to risks, including reduced control over quality assurance and delivery delays. We have an active acquisition program that is an important element of our corporate strategy, and we expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services, and technologies to enhance our offerings. However, acquisitions present risks, including the potential for disruption to our ongoing business and the challenge of integrating acquired companies effectively. Our ability to manage our business operations and generate sufficient cash flows is crucial for servicing our debt. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and contractual obligations. We also believe we could fund future acquisitions and dividend payments with our available cash, cash generated from operations, or additional borrowings. We are subject to various legal proceedings, and litigation can be lengthy and disruptive to our operations. We continuously monitor our operations and investigate allegations of improprieties, and we are subject to a variety of risks and challenges in managing an organization operating in various countries. Our organizational practices and strategic initiatives are designed to enhance our resilience and adaptability in the face of external pressures and disruptions.

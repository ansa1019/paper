We face intense competition as our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, which places significant strain on our management, operational, financial, and other resources. This expansion increases the complexity of our business and may limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results. Our expansion into new products, services, technologies, and geographic regions subjects us to additional business, legal, financial, and competitive risks. We may not be able to manage growth effectively, which could damage our reputation. Our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers, and satisfy customer demands is critical for maintaining operational flexibility and performance under pressure. We may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and growth rate due to risks such as our ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, and fulfill orders. Our international operations expose us to various risks, including local economic and political conditions, government regulation, and geopolitical events, which could impact our organizational resilience. The complexity of our fulfillment and data center networks becomes more challenging as we continue to add capacity. We may not be able to operate our networks effectively, and a failure to optimize inventory in our fulfillment centers could increase our net shipping costs. Our reliance on third parties for fulfillment services increases the risk of disruptions, which could negatively impact our operational continuity. We also face risks related to system interruptions and lack of redundancy, which could prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders and providing services. Our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient, and any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy. We seek to expand our fulfillment capacity to accommodate greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes. We continually evaluate opportunities to optimize and operate our fulfillment and data centers, as inadequate predictions of customer demand could result in excess or insufficient capacity. Our ability to manage our relationships with suppliers is crucial, as any delays or failures could limit our resource generation and operational effectiveness. We are also subject to risks related to government contracts and procurement regulations, which could adversely affect our business. The loss of key senior management personnel could negatively affect our organizational health and resilience. We depend on our senior management and other key personnel, and their loss could harm our business. We face risks related to data loss or other security breaches, which could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of information, adversely affecting our operating results. Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flow, driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital. We expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to enhance the customer experience and improve process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology will continue to improve the consumer experience and increase its ubiquity in people's lives, thereby supporting our organizational resilience and adaptability in a rapidly changing environment.

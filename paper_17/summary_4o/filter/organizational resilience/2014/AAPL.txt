The company's operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions, which pose risks as consumers and businesses may postpone spending in response to various pressures. Uncertainty about these economic conditions could materially adversely affect demand for the company's products and services. The company must continually introduce new products, services, and technologies, enhance existing offerings, and effectively stimulate customer demand to remain competitive. The company's ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its capacity to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products and technologies to the marketplace. The company believes that focused investments in research and development are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products central to the company's core business strategy. The company relies on the performance of distributors, carriers, and other resellers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers, which could affect the company's ability to maintain its competitive advantage. The company faces substantial inventory and other asset risks, including the risk of product obsolescence and the need to manage relationships with its retail partners effectively. The company has invested in programs to enhance reseller sales, which could require substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue. The company's financial condition and operating results depend on its ability to continually improve its products to maintain functional and design advantages. The company must manage risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for new products, and the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand. The company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, which may reduce direct control over production and distribution and could impact the company's flexibility to respond to changing conditions. The company is subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases, and its future operating results depend upon its ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities. The company must also manage the risks associated with information technology system failures and network disruptions, which could prevent access to online stores and services, compromise company or customer data, and result in delayed or canceled orders. The company's business requires it to use and store customer, employee, and business partner personally identifiable information, which poses risks of being targeted for malicious attacks. The company devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption, and other security measures to protect its systems and data, but these measures cannot provide absolute security. The company is also subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, and the outcome of these legal matters is inherently uncertain. The company must continually adapt to changes in laws and regulations that could increase costs and adversely affect its business. The company's future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers, and the availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications depend on developers' perceptions of the relative benefits of developing software for the company's products compared to competitors' platforms.

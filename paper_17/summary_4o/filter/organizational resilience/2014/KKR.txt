Investing in our securities involves risk, and our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely affected by difficult market conditions, including reduced value or performance of investments and the ability to raise or deploy capital. Our profitability may also be adversely affected by fixed costs and the possibility of being unable to scale back costs within a sufficient timeframe to match decreases in net income. Companies in which we have invested may experience decreased revenues, financial losses, credit rating downgrades, and difficulty in obtaining access to financing during periods of economic uncertainty. Negative financial results in our funds' portfolio companies may result in lower investment returns, materially affecting our operating results and cash flow. Adverse conditions may increase the risk of default with respect to investments we manage. Our ability to generate returns on balance sheet assets and make cash available for distribution is contingent on market conditions, which may limit our ability to fund operations, new investments, or unanticipated capital expenditures. We expect to continue to grow our business by increasing assets under management (AUM) in existing businesses and pursuing new investment strategies, which may involve risks associated with capital commitments and operational management. Our growth strategy includes expanding into new geographic markets and businesses, which may result in additional risks and uncertainties, including the possibility of insufficient expertise to engage in such activities profitably. We rely heavily on our financial, accounting, and data processing systems, and any disruption could result in financial loss or reputational damage. Our business continuation or disaster recovery programs may not be sufficient to mitigate harm from disasters or disruptions. We depend on our principal offices for continued operation, and a disaster affecting our infrastructure could materially impact our ability to operate without interruption. Our organizational practices must adapt to changing conditions to maintain operational continuity and resilience. Our investment management activities involve risks related to the complexities of due diligence and the potential for errors in judgment, which may not reveal all relevant facts associated with investments. We face significant litigation risks and may be subject to reputational harm as a result of negative publicity. Our ability to attract and retain clients is closely tied to our reputation for integrity and high-caliber professional services, which can be jeopardized by allegations of misconduct. The management of risk is critical, and we employ various strategies to mitigate exposure to market risks. Our investment strategies are designed to achieve targeted returns while managing reasonable levels of risk. We must navigate external pressures and environmental disturbances that could impact our operational flexibility and adaptability. The evolving preferences of our fund investors necessitate a focus on strategic initiatives and inter-organizational collaboration to enhance our competitive advantage. Our operational resources must be effectively allocated to confront challenges and support systems that promote organizational resilience. The complexity of our business environment requires a multifaceted approach to decision-making and resource management, ensuring that we can respond effectively to unexpected situations and maintain performance under pressure.

We operate in the capital, commodities, and commercial markets, which include asset managers, banks, exchanges, issuers, and financial advisors. Our business is impacted by general economic conditions and volatility in the United States and world financial markets. Unfavorable financial or economic conditions that reduce investor demand for debt securities or issuers' willingness to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuances. The financial services industry is highly regulated, rapidly evolving, and subject to potential increasing regulation, which can increase our costs of doing business. Legal proceedings impose additional expenses on the company and require the attention of senior management, significantly reducing their ability to devote time to other business issues. We continuously review the latest information available and assess our ability to predict the outcome of litigation matters and the effects on our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business, and competitive position. Our operations rely on information technology and critical databases, and we believe we have appropriate policies and internal controls to ensure stability and maintain business continuity; however, our business could be subject to significant disruption from unanticipated system failures or unauthorized access. We have disaster recovery plans that include backup facilities, but our systems are not always fully redundant, and our disaster planning may not always be sufficient. A disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses could materially and adversely impact our operations. We rely on third-party providers for essential services, and if these providers do not perform effectively, we may experience business disruption or processing inefficiencies. Our ability to conduct business may be materially impacted by disruptions involving physical or technological infrastructure due to various factors, including human error, natural disasters, or political unrest. Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential information, and breaches of our technology and systems could cause material interruptions or compromise the confidentiality of material information. The financial services industry is subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny, and compliance with laws and regulations increases the cost of doing business. We have made significant investments in information technology and cannot provide assurances that such investments will result in increased revenues. Our ability to attract and retain quality employees is influenced by compensation costs, which are affected by general economic factors. We face risks related to cybersecurity and the protection of confidential information, and any material incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. We strive to drive global growth by focusing on customers and innovation while boosting operational excellence, productivity, risk management, and compliance. Our strategic initiatives aim to enhance our organizational capabilities and resilience in the face of external pressures and disruptions.

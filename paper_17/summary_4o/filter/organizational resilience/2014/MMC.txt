The company is exposed to multiple risks associated with the global nature of its operations, which could impact its ability to maintain operational continuity and resilience. Should the company experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, such as a cyber attack or natural disaster, its ability to continue operations will depend on the availability of personnel, office facilities, and the proper functioning of technology systems. The company regularly assesses and improves its existing business continuity plans and key management succession, recognizing that a significant disaster could materially interrupt operations and result in financial loss, regulatory actions, reputational harm, or legal liability. The unpredictability of errors and omissions claims, as well as litigation, highlights the need for effective risk assessment and management strategies to mitigate potential adverse outcomes that could materially affect business performance. The company is subject to extensive regulation, and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements may impose significant costs, affecting business operations and resilience. The competitive landscape necessitates a focus on maintaining operational flexibility and adaptability to respond effectively to market demands and external pressures. The company’s ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is critical for sustaining its competitive advantage. The reliance on third-party vendors for services and the risks associated with data incidents underscore the importance of maintaining robust internal knowledge and crisis management capabilities. The company’s strategic initiatives include investments in technology systems and infrastructure to enhance resilience and operational effectiveness. The ability to reconfigure resources and adapt to changing market conditions is essential for achieving major objectives and ensuring organizational health. The company acknowledges that fluctuations in economic and political conditions could adversely affect client demand for services, thereby impacting overall firm performance. The integration of new technologies and methodologies into service offerings is vital for remaining competitive and resilient in a rapidly changing environment. Additionally, the company faces challenges related to the retention of key professionals, as losing experienced employees could hinder its capacity to respond to client needs and secure engagements. The management of pension obligations and funding strategies reflects the company’s commitment to maintaining financial stability and resilience in the face of economic fluctuations. The company’s approach to acquisitions and dispositions is guided by the need to enhance competitiveness and profitability, while also recognizing the risks associated with integration and unanticipated liabilities. The ongoing evaluation of organizational capabilities and the implementation of proactive measures are integral to fostering a culture of resilience and adaptability within the company.

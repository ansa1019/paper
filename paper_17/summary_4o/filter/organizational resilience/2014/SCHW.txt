The company faces a variety of risks that may affect its operations or financial results, driven by factors that it cannot control or predict. Developments in the business, economic, and geopolitical environment could negatively impact the company's business, and the general environment plays a role in client asset valuations and overall investor engagement. The extensive regulation of the company's businesses limits its activities and may subject it to significant penalties, impacting its ability to grow, including adding assets and launching new products. The company maintains systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but violations could occur, resulting in reputational damage and restrictions on certain activities. Technology and operational failures could subject the company to losses, litigation, and regulatory actions, as operational risk includes the potential for loss due to inadequate or failed internal processes, systems, and external events. The company has implemented policies and procedures to manage these risks, including maintaining backup and recovery functions and conducting periodic testing of disaster recovery plans. Despite these efforts, it is not always possible to deter or prevent technological or operational failure, and the company may be required to expend significant additional resources to remediate vulnerabilities. The company’s operations are highly dependent on the integrity of its technology systems, and it is committed to upgrading and enhancing these systems to meet evolving client needs. The company also faces risks from external vendors, and it manages exposure to vendor risk through contractual provisions and ongoing monitoring of vendor performance. The company has established a comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage risks, including operational, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, and legal risks. The risk governance structure includes a global risk committee responsible for oversight of risk management practices and the control environment. The company’s capital plan considers significant risks to meeting its capital goals over time and through evolving economic, financial, and business environments. The capital contingency plan addresses action plans for capital events with low probability but high severity. The company has policies and procedures to protect against fraud and unauthorized access to systems and data, and it actively engages in research and development of new technologies, services, and products. The company’s risk management process includes risk identification and assessment, risk measurement, risk monitoring and reporting, and risk mitigation, with senior management taking an active role in the process. The company continually monitors its pricing in relation to competitors and adjusts trade commission rates and other fee structures to enhance its competitive position. The company’s ability to continue to compete effectively will depend upon its ability to attract new employees and retain existing employees while managing compensation costs. The company also faces significant compliance risk, which includes the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, fines, or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with laws and regulations. Despite the company’s efforts to maintain an effective compliance program, legal breaches could result in reputational harm and significant losses.

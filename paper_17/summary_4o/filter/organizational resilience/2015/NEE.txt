The business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects of nee and fpl are subject to a variety of risks, many of which are beyond their control. The operations of nee and fpl must address the effects of regulation on their business, and any inability or failure to do so adequately could have a material adverse effect on their business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. The regulatory process limits fpl's ability to increase earnings and does not provide assurance regarding the achievement of authorized earnings levels. The local and national political, regulatory, and economic environment has had, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on fpsc decisions, which could require fpl to cancel or delay planned development activities, reduce or delay other planned capital expenditures, or incur costs that may not be recoverable through rates. The operations of nee and fpl are subject to many operational risks, including risks associated with facility start-up operations, the impact of unusual or adverse weather conditions, and performance below expected levels. Severe weather and natural disasters can cause power outages and property damage, requiring nee and fpl to incur additional costs to restore service and repair damaged facilities. The ability of nee and fpl to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform themselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations is critical. Threats of terrorism and catastrophic events, including cyber attacks, could materially adversely affect their operations, limiting their ability to generate, purchase, or transmit power. The implementation of security guidelines has resulted in increased costs, which may adversely affect their business. The ability to obtain insurance and the terms of available coverage could be materially adversely affected by various events, and if insurance coverage is not available on acceptable terms, nee or fpl may be required to pay costs associated with adverse future events. The increasing costs associated with health care plans may materially adversely affect their results of operations. The loss or retirement of key employees may materially adversely affect service and productivity, contributing to higher training and safety costs. Employee strikes or work stoppages could disrupt operations and lead to a loss of revenue. The inability to maintain, negotiate, or renegotiate franchise agreements on acceptable terms could contribute to lower earnings. The costs of providing health care benefits to employees and retirees have increased substantially, which may adversely affect their financial condition. The lack of growth or slower growth in customer accounts or usage could have a material adverse effect on their business. Changes in weather can also affect the production of electricity at power generation facilities, impacting financial results. The ability to recover costs to restore service and repair damaged facilities is subject to regulatory approval, and any determination not to permit timely recovery could have a material adverse effect. The potential effects of greenhouse gas emission limits could create substantial additional costs and require significant capital investment, impacting their ability to operate efficiently. The inability to recover costs through regulatory mechanisms could materially adversely affect their business. The operational risks associated with the construction and maintenance of electric generation and transmission facilities are significant, and any failure to complete projects on schedule or within budget could have a material adverse effect on their business. The ability to adapt and respond to these challenges is essential for maintaining organizational resilience and ensuring operational continuity.

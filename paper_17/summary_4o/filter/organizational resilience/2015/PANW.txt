Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those related to our ability to manage future growth effectively and improve our systems, processes, and controls. The growth and expansion of our business place significant strain on our management, operational, and financial resources. As we grow, we increasingly manage more complex deployments of our products and services, which requires effective coordination throughout our organization. Failure to manage future growth effectively could result in increased costs, negatively impact customer satisfaction, and harm our operating results. Our operating results may vary significantly from period to period and be unpredictable, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. We have experienced rapid growth and increased demand for our products, and our employee headcount has increased significantly. To manage this growth, we must continue to enhance our information technology and financial infrastructure, operating and administrative systems, and our ability to manage headcount and capital efficiently. We may not be able to successfully scale improvements to our enterprise resource planning system or implement improvements to our other systems in a timely manner, which could disrupt existing customer relationships and limit us to smaller deployments of our products. Our productivity and the quality of our products and services may be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train our new employees quickly and effectively. We face intense competition in our market, and to succeed, we need to innovate and offer products that are differentiated from existing infrastructure products. Our future success depends on our ability to expand the deployment of our platform with existing end-customers and secure other areas of their networks. We must also effectively manage our supply chain and ensure that we can fulfill customer orders. A significant natural disaster or geopolitical unrest could materially adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with these could result in reduced sales, substantial product inventory write-offs, and reputational damage. Our corporate culture has contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation and teamwork that foster our operational effectiveness. Our growth strategy is dependent on increasing sales to medium and large enterprises, which involves risks that may not be present with sales to smaller entities. We rely on revenue from subscription and support services, which may decline due to various factors, including customer satisfaction and market conditions. Our ability to sell our products is also dependent on the quality of our technical support services, and failure to provide high-quality support could adversely affect customer satisfaction and our sales. We may acquire other businesses, which could require significant management attention and disrupt our business. The successful integration of acquired companies is critical to our growth and operational resilience. We must also navigate the complexities of international sales and operations, which are subject to various risks, including political and economic uncertainties. Our ability to respond to changing market conditions and customer needs is essential for maintaining our competitive advantage and achieving organizational resilience.

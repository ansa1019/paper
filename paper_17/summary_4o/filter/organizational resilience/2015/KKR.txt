Investing in our securities involves risk, and our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely affected by difficult market conditions, which can reduce the value or performance of the investments we manage. Our ability to mitigate known risks is limited, and we can provide no assurance that our mitigation efforts will be successful. Our business is materially affected by global economic conditions, including interest rates, availability of credit, inflation rates, and economic uncertainty, which may impact our ability to raise or deploy capital. The unprecedented turmoil in the global financial markets during 2008 and 2009 provoked significant volatility and had a material adverse effect on our businesses. Recent volatility has continued, with low levels of growth and high levels of government debt persisting in major markets. The slowing pace of fixed asset investment growth in China poses risks to economic stability and may hinder demand for global commodities. Adverse market conditions may reduce opportunities for our funds to make, exit, and realize value from their investments, which could negatively impact our net income and cash flow. During periods of economic downturns, companies in which we have invested may experience decreased revenues, financial losses, and increased funding costs, which could materially affect our operating results and cash flow. We may not be able to manage our exposure to adverse conditions effectively. Our liquidity requirements are significant, and adverse economic conditions may adversely affect our sources of liquidity, impacting our business operations in the future. Our primary liquidity needs include cash required to grow our business, service debt obligations, fund cash operating expenses, and make future purchase price payments in connection with acquisitions. We may also need to incur debt to finance payments under our tax receivable agreement, which could negatively impact our liquidity. Our organizational structure involves complex provisions of U.S. federal income tax laws, which may be subject to changes that could adversely affect our business. The investment management business is intensely competitive, and we face risks related to the performance of our funds, which impacts our ability to raise capital. Our ability to attract new capital and investors is driven by the perception of our investment products as attractive vehicles for capital appreciation. Our success depends on our ability to identify and create products that appeal to investors, and we may face challenges in fundraising due to competition and changing investor preferences. We pursue growth through acquisitions and strategic partnerships, which may expose us to additional risks and uncertainties. Our operational risks include reliance on financial, accounting, and data processing systems, which, if disrupted, could result in financial loss and reputational damage. Cybersecurity threats are a significant concern, and any breaches could jeopardize our operations and those of our fund investors. We strive to maintain a work environment that fosters collaboration and alignment of interests, as failure to do so may impair our ability to compete successfully. Our business continuity and disaster recovery programs may not be sufficient to mitigate harm from operational disruptions. Overall, our organizational resilience is challenged by external pressures, market volatility, and the need for effective risk management strategies to navigate complex and uncertain environments.

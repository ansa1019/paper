Our operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition, including social, political, and economic risks of doing business in many countries. We conduct a significant portion of our business outside the U.S., which exposes us to difficulties in staffing and managing international operations, local business practices, and economic instability. Disruptions in the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Our business and operations could suffer in the event of system failures or cyber security attacks, despite the existence of a disaster recovery plan. We depend on the deep industry knowledge and efforts of our executive officers and key employees, and the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business. Our performance could be impacted by deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting, which may not prevent all errors or misstatements. We pursue growth opportunities in international markets, but we are subject to foreign currency risk due to potential fluctuations in exchange rates. We believe that our ability to generate cash from operating activities and distributions from our co-investment ventures is adequate to meet our anticipated future development and operational needs. We seek to minimize risks through geographic diversification of our portfolio and market research, but these risks cannot be eliminated. Our operating performance is impacted by the economic conditions of the specific markets in which we have concentrations of properties, and any downturn in these markets could adversely affect our business. We evaluate our earthquake insurance coverage annually and may self-insure based on current industry practices. Our investments in real estate properties are subject to varying degrees of risk, and we seek to minimize these risks through our asset management capabilities. We may not be able to obtain financing for development projects on favorable terms, and we may experience delays in obtaining necessary permits. We have significant investments in properties located in areas subject to natural disasters, and we carry insurance for these risks, although some losses may not be fully insured. Our ability to access debt and equity capital on favorable terms depends on market conditions and our financial position. We may need to borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet distribution requirements, which could result in increased financial strain. Our business strategy includes maintaining control of well-positioned land and leveraging our infrastructure to increase investments in real estate with minimal increases to administrative expenses. We believe our scale and quality of our operating platform provide us with unique competitive advantages. Our strategic initiatives focus on creating value through development and acquisitions, while managing risks associated with market conditions and operational performance. We recognize the importance of maintaining operational flexibility and adaptability in response to external pressures and disruptions. Our organizational practices emphasize collaboration and knowledge sharing among teams to enhance our resilience and effectiveness in navigating complex situations.

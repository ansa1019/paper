This annual report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements, including our expectations regarding the future conduct and growth of the business, which are influenced by our ability to adapt to technological change and successfully introduce new and enhanced products, services, and business models. We face intense competitive pressures that may harm our operating results, and our competitors may introduce superior products and services or reduce prices, impacting our ability to acquire and retain customers. Our future growth depends upon our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends and to drive broad adoption of the products and services we develop and market. We are investing significant resources in our product development, marketing, and sales capabilities, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. Our business operations, data centers, information technology, and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from various events beyond our control, which may impair the availability of our products and services and damage our reputation. We are continually investing resources to update and improve our internal information technology systems and software platforms, as these improvements are essential for maintaining operational continuity and responding effectively to environmental disruptions. Our reliance on third-party partners for critical services means that any failure of these partners may disrupt our business operations and harm our financial results. We are also subject to various legal proceedings and regulatory inquiries that could result in unfavorable outcomes and adversely affect our business. The tax preparation industry continues to receive heightened attention from federal and state governments, and we may not be able to respond quickly to regulatory developments, which could increase our costs and limit our revenue opportunities. Our growth strategy depends on our ability to develop, maintain, and leverage new and existing relationships with third-party partners, as these relationships are critical for delivering our offerings and operating our business. We are committed to protecting our customers against fraud and have implemented additional security measures in our products while working with state governments to share information regarding suspicious filings. Our financial results may fluctuate significantly due to various factors, including changes in consumer behavior and the timing of revenue recognition. We have encountered difficulties in launching new products and services in the past, and if we misjudge customer needs in the future, our new products and services may not succeed. Our operations are subject to significant seasonality, and we expect this seasonality to continue to impact our financial results. We have also invested in new business models, geographies, strategies, and initiatives, which may involve significant risks and uncertainties. Our ability to combat increasing fraudulent activities by third parties is essential for maintaining customer confidence and ensuring the integrity of our services. The complexity of our products and the condensed development cycles under which we operate increase the risk of errors in our products and the risk of launch delays, which may harm our revenue and reputation. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated working capital needs and other liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months, allowing us to respond nimbly to opportunities and challenges in the market.

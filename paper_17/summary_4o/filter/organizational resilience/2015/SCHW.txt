The company faces a variety of risks that may affect its operations or financial results, driven by factors that are often beyond its control. Developments in the business, economic, and geopolitical environment could negatively impact the company's business, and the general environment—including economic, corporate, regulatory, and geopolitical developments—plays a role in client asset valuations and overall investor engagement. The company is subject to extensive regulation, which continues to grow more complex, and the requirements imposed by regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of financial markets and the safety of financial institutions. The company maintains systems and procedures aimed at compliance with applicable laws and regulations, although violations could occur, leading to reputational damage and operational constraints. The company’s operational risk includes potential losses due to inadequate or failed internal processes, systems, and external events, which could significantly impact its ability to process and settle client transactions. The company has established a comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage risks, including operational, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, and legal risks. This program incorporates risk identification, assessment, measurement, monitoring, and mitigation strategies, with senior management actively involved in the risk management process. The company’s operational risk management includes policies and procedures designed to keep operational risks at levels appropriate to the inherent risk of its business, and it conducts periodic testing of disaster recovery plans to minimize business interruptions. The company also focuses on maintaining adequate liquidity, which is crucial for its business operations, and it conducts regular liquidity stress testing to ensure the ability to maintain sufficient liquidity during market-related or company-specific stress events. The company’s capital management strategy aims to support its business strategy while meeting regulatory capital requirements, and it conducts regular capital stress testing to assess potential financial impacts of adverse events. The company’s risk culture is rooted in its enterprise risk management framework, which incorporates its purpose, vision, and values. The board of directors oversees the risk management program, ensuring that risk appetite is aligned with corporate strategy. The company’s operational resilience is further supported by its commitment to upgrading and enhancing technology systems to meet evolving client needs and regulatory changes. Despite these efforts, the company acknowledges that it may not always be able to prevent technological or operational failures, and it may incur losses or face regulatory actions in such cases. The company also relies on external service providers for key functions, which introduces additional operational risks that are managed through contractual provisions and ongoing performance monitoring. The company’s ability to adapt to changing market conditions and regulatory requirements is critical for maintaining its competitive advantage and ensuring organizational effectiveness.

Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk, and we expect our revenue growth rate to continue to decline, which may adversely affect our business operations and future prospects. Our business could be adversely affected by unforeseen operating expenses, difficulties, and other unpredictable factors. We may encounter challenges in predicting customer demand for our products and the entry of competitive products, which could impact our ability to maintain profitability. Our successful entry into new markets is critical for our revenue growth prospects, and we may not have the necessary resources to compete effectively in these markets. We have made substantial investments in data centers and cloud computing infrastructure, but it is unclear whether sales in new markets will justify these investments. The sales prices of our products may decline due to competitive pricing pressures, which could harm our financial results. We may not be successful in developing and introducing new offerings on a timely basis, and any new product offerings may not enable us to maintain our prices and gross profits. Our financial performance may not meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts, leading to a decline in our stock price. Factors that may cause our revenues and operating results to fall below expectations include our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and general economic conditions. We may experience difficulties in hiring qualified personnel, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Our business depends significantly on our existing customers renewing their subscriptions, and any decline in customer renewals would harm our revenue growth. We depend on channel partners to grow our business, and if we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining these relationships, our ability to compete in the marketplace could be impaired. Our sales cycles are long and may lengthen further, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. We are subject to risks inherent in international sales, including compliance with international laws and regulations. Our success depends on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and brand, and any litigation related to intellectual property could harm our operating results. Natural disasters and other events beyond our control could disrupt our operations and negatively affect our business. We have experienced and may continue to experience difficulties in our investments in geographic expansion, including hiring qualified personnel. Our operations involve the storage and processing of sensitive information, and a cyber-security event could lead to significant liabilities and harm our competitive position. Disruptions in our services could damage our customers' businesses and harm our reputation and financial results. We believe that our ability to continuously enhance our products and services is crucial for attracting new customers and retaining existing ones. Our revenue growth depends on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties, and reliance on these partners exposes us to risks of poor performance. Changes in laws and regulations related to data privacy and cloud computing could impair our ability to maintain and grow our customer base. We may not have sufficient insurance to cover losses from security breaches or disruptions in our services. Our ability to adjust to changing laws and regulations will be critical for our business continuity and resilience.

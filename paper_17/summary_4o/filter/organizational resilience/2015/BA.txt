Our commercial airplanes business depends heavily on commercial airlines and is subject to unique risks, including significant deterioration in the global economic environment, which could result in fewer new orders for aircraft or cause customers to postpone or cancel contractual orders. The commercial aircraft production system is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination with U.S. and non-U.S. suppliers and highly-skilled labor, and operational challenges impacting production could result in delays or failure to meet customer demand. Our ability to maintain a healthy production system, achieve planned production rate targets, and meet stringent performance and reliability standards is critical for organizational resilience. We continue to increase production rates for various aircraft programs while engaging in ongoing development, which involves risks associated with meeting development, testing, production, and certification schedules. 

The introduction of new aircraft programs involves increased risks, and our ability to deliver aircraft on time and achieve program profitability is subject to significant risks. Operational challenges, including delays or defects in supplier components, could result in increased production costs and delayed deliveries, negatively impacting revenues and operating margins. We are also subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, which could result in additional costs and impact our financial position. Our business may be impacted by disruptions including threats to physical security, information technology failures, and public health crises, which could affect our internal operations and ability to deliver products and services.

We rely on subcontractors and suppliers for raw materials and components, and any service disruption from these suppliers could materially affect our ability to meet commitments to customers. The complexity of our contracts, particularly fixed-price contracts, introduces financial risks related to estimating costs and revenues, and changes in these estimates could adversely affect future financial performance. Our operations expose us to environmental liabilities, and we could incur substantial costs if we violate environmental laws. 

We face significant competition in the commercial jet airplane market, which is characterized by aggressive international competitors and price pressures. Our strategy is focused on successful execution in healthy core businesses, supplemented by Boeing Capital, which facilitates financing solutions for our customers. The cyclicality of commercial and defense markets sometimes offsets, and we continue to seek opportunities to reduce costs and improve efficiency. 

We are also subject to risks associated with government contracts, including changes in procurement regulations that could increase compliance costs. Our ability to adjust to changing acquisition priorities and meet affordability targets set by the U.S. Department of Defense is critical for maintaining revenues and market share. Future budget cuts or procurement decisions could result in reductions or delays of existing contracts, adversely affecting our financial position. 

In summary, our organizational resilience is contingent upon our capacity to adapt to complex operational challenges, maintain effective supplier relationships, navigate regulatory environments, and respond to competitive pressures while ensuring production efficiency and meeting customer demands.

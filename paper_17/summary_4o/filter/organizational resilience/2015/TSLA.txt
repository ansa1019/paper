We may experience significant delays or other complications in the design, manufacture, launch, and production ramp of new vehicles, which could harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results. The complexity in our business continues to grow as we introduce new products and variants, and we have limited experience simultaneously designing, testing, manufacturing, upgrading, adapting, and selling our electric vehicles. We may be unable to meet our production and delivery plans, and any significant additional delay or complication could materially damage our brand and business. Our ability to further increase vehicle production will depend upon various factors, including our ability to use new manufacturing processes while maintaining quality levels. Certain suppliers have historically experienced delays in meeting our demand, and we continue to focus on supplier capabilities and constraints. We may experience delays due to supply chain disruptions, and changes in business conditions, labor issues, and natural disasters could also affect our suppliers' ability to deliver components in a timely manner. Our long-term success will be dependent upon our ability to achieve market acceptance of our vehicles, and there is no guarantee that our vehicles will continue to be successfully accepted by the general public. We have limited experience in introducing new vehicles and may face difficulties meeting our delivery and growth plans. If we are unable to ramp up to meet our delivery goals globally, this could have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, we face risks associated with our international operations and expansion, including unfavorable regulatory, political, tax, and labor conditions. We have limited experience selling and servicing our products internationally, and if we fail to successfully address these risks, our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition could be materially harmed. Our growth is highly dependent upon the adoption by consumers of alternative fuel vehicles, and if the market for electric vehicles does not develop as we expect, our business could be harmed. We expect to continue expanding our operations significantly internationally, and our future operating results depend on our ability to manage this expansion successfully. We may not be able to produce, market, sell, and service our vehicles successfully if we fail to manage future growth effectively. Our ability to maintain confidence among customers, suppliers, analysts, and other parties in our liquidity and long-term business prospects is crucial, and maintaining such confidence may be complicated by various factors. We are subject to substantial regulation, which is evolving, and unfavorable changes or failure to comply with these regulations could substantially harm our business. We may also face challenges in attracting customers and establishing ourselves in new markets, which could harm our business. We are highly dependent on the services of key employees, and any failure to attract and retain senior leadership could adversely impact our business. Our facilities or operations could be damaged or adversely affected as a result of disasters, and we may incur expenses relating to such damages, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. We are subject to various environmental and safety laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs upon us and negatively impact our ability to operate our manufacturing facilities. Our future growth is dependent on our ability to manage various risks, including those related to product liability claims, competition, and market volatility.

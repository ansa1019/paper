The company's operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions, which could materially adversely affect demand for the company's products and services. Uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions could have a significant impact on the company's suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers, and other channel partners. The company must continually introduce new products, services, and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The company has invested in manufacturing process equipment and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements, which help ensure the supply of components and finished goods. The company's reliance on single-source outsourcing partners for many components exposes it to significant supply and pricing risks. Disruptions in manufacturing or logistics can occur for various reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues, or international trade disputes. The company is exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by various events, which can adversely impact the company's business by preventing access to online services, interfering with customer transactions, or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of products. The company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, but these measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities. The company's business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personally identifiable information, which subjects it to significant reputational, financial, legal, and operational consequences. The company relies on the continued service and availability of key personnel, and competition for their talents is intense. Political events, international trade disputes, and other business interruptions could harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, potentially having a material adverse effect on the company and its customers, suppliers, and partners. The company's operations are subject to risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers, which could result in disruption to the company's business and harm its reputation. The company has invested in programs to enhance reseller sales, which can require substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The company's financial condition and operating results depend substantially on its ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. The company faces significant competition in its markets, and its ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services, and technologies to the marketplace. The company's future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers, and if third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company's products, customers may choose not to buy the company's products. The company's operations and facilities are in locations that are prone to natural disasters, and global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects, making it difficult or impossible for the company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers. Following an interruption to its business, the company could require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales.

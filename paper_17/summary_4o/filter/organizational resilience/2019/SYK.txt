This report contains statements that are not historical facts and are considered "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations. We face uncertainties that might result from modification or repeal of provisions of the Affordable Care Act, which could have a significant effect on our business. Our operations are subject to extensive governmental regulation, and failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may adversely affect our business continuity. We are subject to cost containment measures resulting in pricing pressures, which could impact our operational flexibility and strategic initiatives. The markets in which we compete are highly competitive, and our ability to maintain adequate working relationships with healthcare professionals is crucial for our organizational effectiveness. We may be unable to capitalize on previous or future acquisitions, and the integration of acquired businesses may present challenges that could affect our performance. We rely on indirect distribution channels, and any disruption in these channels could adversely affect our ability to market and sell our products. We are subject to additional risks associated with our extensive global operations, including changes in regulatory requirements and political instability, which could impact our organizational resilience. Our reliance on certain suppliers exposes us to product shortages and unanticipated increases in prices, which could adversely affect our competitive position. We may experience loss of market share, additional expenses, and harm to our reputation due to interruptions in manufacturing operations. We have made investments to address cybersecurity threats, but a security breach could impact our systems and stakeholder information. Our ability to attract and retain key employees is essential for meeting our strategic business objectives, and failure to do so could adversely impact our organizational capabilities. We are in the process of implementing a new global ERP system, and any disruptions in this implementation could adversely affect our operations. We may incur significant legal expenses related to product liability claims, which could materially impact our financial position. The outcomes of ongoing legal proceedings may result in significant claims and settlements that could adversely affect our financial condition. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities based on the applicable accounting guidance, and uncertainties in tax positions could impact our effective tax rate. Our financial statements include the operations of acquired businesses starting from the completion of the acquisition, and significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets. Future changes in judgments and assumptions used in our impairment testing could result in significantly different estimates of fair values. We maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, and if actual product life cycles are less favorable than projected, additional inventory write-downs may be required. We are involved in various ongoing legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, and the outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time.

The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations, stockholders' equity, cash flows, and financial condition. These risks are mitigated, to the extent possible, by our ability to maintain and improve business and data governance policies, enhanced processes, and internal security controls, including our ability to escalate and respond to known and potential risks. Our ability to mitigate these risks may be impacted by frequent changes to, and growth in complexity of, the techniques used to breach, obtain unauthorized access to, or sabotage IT systems and infrastructure. We have developed systems and processes designed to protect our customers' and our customers' customers' proprietary and other sensitive data, but we can provide no assurances that such measures will provide absolute security. We have from time to time experienced interruptions in our services, and such interruptions may occur in the future. The ongoing coronavirus epidemic could potentially disrupt the supply chain of hardware needed to maintain these third-party systems or to run our business. As we increase our reliance on these third-party systems, our exposure to damage from service interruptions may increase. Interruptions in our services may cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to make warranty or other claims against us, or to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers. Our business would also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable. Despite precautions taken at our facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism could result in lengthy interruptions in our services. We do not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from various events. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, privacy laws, regulations, and standards may limit the use and adoption of our services, reduce overall demand for our services, and lead to significant fines, penalties, or liabilities for noncompliance. Our ability to deliver our services is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the internet by third parties. The internet's infrastructure is highly fragmented and distributed, and outages and delays could reduce the availability of the internet to us or our customers for delivery of our internet-based services. Our corporate headquarters and a significant portion of our critical business operations are located near major seismic faults, and we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses. Climate-related events, including the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, have the potential to disrupt our business, our third-party suppliers, or the business of our customers. We expect to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity to allow us to scale with our customers and continuously evolve our security measures. Our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively. We believe that maintaining a strong corporate culture fosters dialogue, collaboration, recognition, and a sense of family, which are essential for attracting and retaining the best talent. Our ability to scale our operations and increase productivity is critical, and we anticipate that significant additional investments will be required to address the needs of our customers and expand into new geographic areas.

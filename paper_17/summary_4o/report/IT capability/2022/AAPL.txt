The company's business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, including information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents. System redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the company's or its vendors' business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the company's business by preventing access to the company's online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the company's products. The company's operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions, and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the company's business, results of operations and financial condition. The company relies on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers, and the financial condition of these resellers could weaken, leading to a reduction in their ordering and marketing of the company's products. The company's ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The company must make significant investments in research and development, and there can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected returns. The company's products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, and continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics. The company's reliance on outsourcing partners for manufacturing and logistical services can reduce direct control over production and distribution, potentially affecting the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided. The company has invested in manufacturing process equipment held at certain outsourcing partners and has made prepayments to certain suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements, which help ensure the supply of components and finished goods. However, if these outsourcing partners experience severe financial problems or other disruptions, the continued supply can be reduced or terminated. The company's business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information, and while it devotes significant resources to network and data security, these measures cannot provide absolute security. Losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information could materially adversely affect the company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. The company is also exposed to malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems, which could impair its ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services. The company's future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers, and the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends on developers' perception of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software for the company's products compared to competitors' platforms. The company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business, and the outcomes of these matters are inherently uncertain, which could materially adversely affect the company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.

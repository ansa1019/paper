The global payments industry is highly competitive, with substantial and intense competition that may materially and adversely affect overall business and results of operations. Our payment programs compete against competitors both within and outside of the global payments industry, including general purpose payments networks, alternative payments systems, and new entrants focused on online activity. The ability to compete may be affected by regulatory and legislative initiatives, as well as the outcomes of litigation. We rely on third parties for the development of and access to new technologies, and our ability to develop and adopt new services and technologies may be inhibited by industry-wide solutions and standards. The payments industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes, which can impact our business in several ways, including the development of new technologies that may render our current technologies obsolete. 

We are continually involved in developing complex multi-rail solutions and diversifying our integrated products and services to remain competitive and meet the needs of the payments markets. These efforts carry risks associated with diversification initiatives, including cost overruns and delays in delivery. Our investments in new networks, such as open banking solutions and digital identity capabilities, support and strengthen our payments and services solutions. 

Information security incidents or account data compromise events could disrupt our business, damage our reputation, increase our costs, and cause losses. Information security risks have significantly increased due to the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication of organized crime and hackers. Our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission, and storage of confidential information and technology in our computer systems and networks, as well as the systems of our third-party providers. 

We face disintermediation risks as industry participants invest in and develop alternative capabilities, such as account-to-account payments, which could facilitate transactions that compete with our core payments network. Regulatory changes may also enable third-party providers to route payment transactions away from our network. The complexity of payment technology requires careful management to address security vulnerabilities that differ from those faced on our core payment network.

Our ability to keep pace technologically is crucial, as we work with fintechs and technology companies that leverage our technology to enhance payment safety and security. The evolving nature of cyber threats necessitates continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes, and practices designed to protect our systems from attack. 

We are subject to increasingly complex regulations related to privacy, data, and information security in the jurisdictions in which we operate. These regulations require monitoring of and changes to our data practices regarding the collection, use, disclosure, storage, transfer, and protection of personal information. Failure to comply with these laws could result in fines, sanctions, or other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and overall business. 

Our ability to attract and retain a highly qualified and diverse workforce is critical, particularly in technology and other areas important to the growth of our business. The market for specialized skill sets is highly competitive, and our inability to meet candidate demands may lead to an increase in declined offers.

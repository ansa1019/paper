The company relies on the efficient, uninterrupted, and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate its business and securely process, transmit, and store electronic information. Cybersecurity, data protection, and technology risks are significant, as the company could incur substantial liability or damage to its reputation if its information systems are breached or if it fails to protect client or company data. The company faces ongoing challenges in managing access controls in a complex environment, and the increasing frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks pose risks to its IT infrastructure. The company’s business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if it is unable to develop and implement improvements in technology or respond effectively to the threat of digital disruption and other technological changes. The company depends on technology systems for conducting business and providing the data and analytics necessary for management. Strategic initiatives involving investments in or partnerships with technology companies are part of the company’s growth strategy, which includes investments in technology and infrastructure to support its systems. The company must anticipate and respond effectively to the threat of digital disruption, which comes from traditional players and new entrants utilizing technology and innovation to improve client experiences and alter business models. The company’s reliance on third-party providers for key functions exposes it to risks, as these vendors may act in ways that could harm its business. The integration of information systems from acquired businesses is complex and exposes the company to additional risks, including the potential for undiscovered weaknesses that could affect the value derived from acquisitions. The company’s ability to execute its strategic initiatives could be adversely affected if key vendors fail to perform their obligations. The company’s operational flexibility is contingent upon maintaining effective technology systems, and failure to keep pace with technological changes could adversely impact its business and results of operations. The company’s investments in technology systems may not deliver expected benefits or may become obsolete more quickly than anticipated, resulting in operational difficulties or additional costs. The company is subject to significant uninsured exposures arising from errors and omissions, and its businesses provide numerous professional services, which could lead to significant liability for monetary damages, including reputational harm. The company’s technology capabilities are integral to its ability to respond to changes in client demand and industry conditions, and the competition for talent in the data privacy and cybersecurity space is intense. The company’s operational resilience is critical, as its ability to recover from disasters or business continuity problems depends on the functioning of its technology infrastructure. The company’s strategic management practices include ongoing assessments to improve business continuity, disaster recovery, and data recovery plans. The evolving regulatory landscape regarding data privacy and cybersecurity imposes additional costs and operational challenges, which may divert resources from other initiatives and projects. The company’s ability to comply with laws and regulations related to privacy, data security, and data protection is essential for maintaining its reputation and operational integrity.

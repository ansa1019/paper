Our business, results of operations, and financial condition have been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused economic and financial disruptions globally. The pandemic has led to significant supply constraints seen industry-wide due to component shortages, resulting in extended lead times and higher supply chain costs. The ability to execute strategic plans and manage operational flexibility is critical, as the pandemic has exacerbated existing risks and uncertainties. The overall movement toward industry consolidation among both our competitors and our customers has influenced market dynamics and competitive positioning. We continue to manage through significant supply constraints and have taken multiple steps to mitigate the impacts of component shortages, including optimizing our inventory build and customer delivery plans. Our investments in technology resources and capabilities are aimed at enhancing our operational efficiency and supporting our business transformation initiatives. The transformation of our business to deliver more software and subscription offerings, where revenue is recognized over time, reflects our commitment to adapting to changing customer needs and market demands. We have also been focused on developing new products and services to meet the evolving requirements of our customers, which include offering our products and solutions in a manner that aligns with their consumption preferences. Our strategy involves leveraging technology capabilities to drive innovation and enhance customer value, while also ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. The ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, and security is fundamental to our information management capability. Our IT capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources, such as technology, knowledge, practices, and management skills, to further organizational goals. The ongoing challenges posed by supply chain disruptions and the need for effective resource allocation underscore the importance of our IT architecture and governance practices. Furthermore, our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers and contract manufacturers. The reliance on external relationships and the management of our technology portfolio are critical to maintaining our competitive advantage in the market. The integration of our platforms across networking, security, collaboration, applications, and the cloud is designed to help our customers manage more users, devices, and things connecting to their networks. As we navigate the complexities of the current business environment, our focus remains on driving profitable growth through strategic resource allocation and investment in key priority areas. The ability to adapt to dynamic changes in the market and effectively manage our organizational capabilities will be essential for sustaining our performance and achieving our long-term objectives.

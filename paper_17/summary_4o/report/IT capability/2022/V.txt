As a global payments technology company, we are subject to complex and evolving regulations that govern our operations, which could limit our ability to enforce our payments system rules and require us to adopt new rules or change existing rules. The evolving regulatory focus on the payments industry could negatively impact our ability to use our intellectual property to differentiate our products and services and the quality and types of products and services we offer. Innovations in payment technology have enabled us to expand into new products and services, but they have also expanded the potential scope of regulatory influence. Our compliance programs and policies are designed to support our compliance with a wide array of regulations and laws, including privacy and data protection, which are critical to our information management capability. The ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, and confidentiality is essential as we navigate these regulatory landscapes. 

The global payments space is intensely competitive, and as technology evolves, new competitors or methods of payment emerge. Our products compete with various payment methods, including cash, checks, electronic funds, and alternative payments providers focused on enabling payments through e-commerce and mobile channels. The competitive landscape is shifting, and we face increasing competition from clients and emerging payment providers, including fintechs and technology companies that have developed payment systems enabled through online activity. Our ability to adapt to technological change and the proliferation of alternative types of payment services is crucial for maintaining our market position. 

We rely on relationships with financial institutions, acquirers, processors, merchants, and other third parties to maintain and expand the use and acceptance of our products. Our relationships with industry participants are complex and require us to balance the interests of multiple third parties. The successful management of these relationships is vital for our operational efficiency and overall business performance. 

Our business relies heavily on the processing of data across various jurisdictions, and legal requirements regarding the handling of personal data and information may impede our services or result in increased costs. The ongoing evolution of privacy and data protection laws could create inconsistent or conflicting requirements that may limit our ability to innovate or compete effectively in certain jurisdictions. 

Furthermore, our strategic resource allocation towards technology investments is essential for enhancing our capabilities and ensuring operational flexibility. The integration of new technologies and the development of innovative solutions are critical for driving business transformation and achieving competitive advantage. Our ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources effectively, in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities, underscores the importance of our IT capability in supporting our business strategies and operational goals. 

In summary, our IT capabilities, which encompass the coordination of our assets and internal processes, are fundamental to navigating the complexities of regulatory compliance, competitive pressures, and technological advancements in the global payments landscape.

We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases, or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, malicious insiders, telecommunication failures, user errors, or catastrophic events. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, making it difficult to implement adequate preventative measures. Any of these occurrences could result in disruptions in our operations, the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to our brand and reputation, and litigation and potential liability for the company. We have continued to undertake several initiatives to improve the flexibility and capacity in our transportation network, improve yield management, and increase operational efficiency and contain costs across all segments. The continued deployment of technology improvements, including several facility automation projects and the accelerated deployment of our on-road integrated optimization and navigation system, should increase our network capacity and improve operational efficiency, flexibility, and reliability. Our franchisee locations also rely on the use of information technology systems to manage their business processes and activities. We may be required to increase our spending on data and system security due to the reliance on information technology systems, which are critical for managing customer relationships and operational processes. In addition, the provision of service to our customers involves the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data. The cost and operational consequences of implementing further data or system protection measures could be significant. We have made significant capital investments in technology to support both our existing business and anticipated growth, which includes investments in technology infrastructure and software development. Our ability to leverage technology capabilities effectively has become a key factor in transforming our firm into a competitive force. The deployment of technology is essential for enhancing operational efficiency and supporting business needs. We recognize that our IT capabilities are integral to our strategic resource allocation and operational flexibility, enabling us to respond to market dynamics and competitive pressures effectively. The integration of technology into our operational processes is vital for maintaining our competitive advantage and ensuring the reliability and security of our information systems. Our management practices include ongoing evaluations of our technology resources to optimize performance and align with our organizational goals. The evolving landscape of information technology necessitates continuous investment in IT capabilities to enhance our operational effectiveness and support our business transformation initiatives.

In 2021, we generated sales from the delivery of products and services to our customers, with net sales of $67,044 million, primarily driven by long-term contracts with the U.S. government and international customers. Our business segments include aeronautics, missiles and fire control, rotary and mission systems, and space, each contributing to our overall performance through various advanced technology systems, products, and services. We focus on improving the quality and predictability of our delivery, which is essential for meeting customer demands in a competitive environment. Our operational flexibility is supported by a robust IT architecture that enhances our ability to manage complex contracts and coordinate our resources effectively. We invest significantly in information technology to support programs and general enterprise infrastructure, which includes costs for the development or purchase of internal-use software. The majority of our contracts are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method, which requires significant estimates and assumptions about future costs and revenues. Our ability to manage these estimates effectively is crucial for maintaining operational efficiency and achieving performance gains. We also engage in independent research and development activities to enhance existing products and develop future technologies, which are integral to our innovation strategy. The ongoing transformation of our IT capabilities is designed to leverage our technology resources and enhance our competitive advantage in the market. Additionally, we have established a comprehensive governance framework to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and to manage risks associated with our operations. Our strategic resource allocation focuses on enhancing our capabilities and optimizing our processes to respond to market dynamics effectively. We recognize the importance of data management and information reliability in supporting our decision-making processes, which are critical for maintaining our market positioning. The integration of advanced technologies into our operations facilitates improved communication and collaboration across our business segments, enhancing our relational capacity with customers and partners. We continue to monitor external influences that may impact our business environment, including changes in government funding and international market conditions. Our commitment to investing in technology infrastructure and capabilities is reflected in our capital expenditures, which are primarily directed towards supporting new and existing programs. The successful deployment of our IT systems is essential for achieving our organizational goals and enhancing our overall performance. As we navigate the complexities of the current business landscape, our focus remains on aligning our business strategy with our technological capabilities to drive innovation and deliver value to our stakeholders.

Nike relies significantly on information technology to operate its business, including supply chain and retail operations, and any failure, inadequacy, or interruption of that technology could harm its ability to effectively operate. The company is heavily dependent on information technology systems across various functions, including product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales, distribution, and processing financial information. The reliability of these information technology systems is critical to managing inventory and shipping products to customers in a timely manner. Nike has implemented information technology systems globally, and ongoing efforts to integrate, secure, and enhance these systems are essential for operational efficiency. However, the company cannot assure that measures taken will be sufficient to protect against cyber-attacks, system failures, or data loss. The increased use of employee-owned devices and remote work arrangements presents additional operational risks to these systems, including heightened risks of cyber-attacks. Nike has experienced cyber-attacks in the past and anticipates continued risks in this area. The company also utilizes information technology systems for digital marketing, consumer engagement, and electronic communications, which are vital for maintaining customer relationships and driving sales. Disruption in these systems may impede digital engagement and result in lost revenues and damage to reputation. Nike's digital platforms must be designed effectively to work well with various technologies, systems, and networks. The company has made significant investments in digital technologies and information systems to enhance its digital commerce operations, which are critical for meeting consumer expectations and maintaining competitive advantage. The integration of technology capabilities is fundamental to Nike's strategy of delivering compelling consumer experiences through digital platforms and retail. The company's strategic initiatives include unifying investments in data and analytics, demand sensing, and inventory management against an end-to-end technology foundation to accelerate digital transformation. Furthermore, the company acknowledges that operational flexibility and responsiveness to market dynamics are essential for navigating competitive pressures and shifting consumer preferences. The ongoing evolution of retail, driven by digital and mono-brand experiences, necessitates continuous investment in technology and innovation to meet the demands of consumers. Nike's ability to effectively manage its information technology resources is a key factor in sustaining its competitive positioning and achieving long-term revenue growth. The company recognizes that any significant failure in its information technology infrastructure could adversely affect its business operations and financial performance.

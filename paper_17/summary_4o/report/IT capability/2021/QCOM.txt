The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic had an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, resulting in significant economic uncertainty, declines in business and consumer confidence, and global demand in the wireless industry. This situation has impacted our ability to estimate future performance and may exacerbate other risks discussed in this report. Our industry is experiencing concentration of device share among a few companies, particularly at the premium tier, which contributes to our revenue dependency on a limited number of customers and licensees. Certain original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are developing their own integrated circuit products, which may reduce our revenues. We spend significant resources on understanding customer feedback and specifications to incorporate into our product launches, but these efforts may not result in purchase commitments. The concentration of device share may also result in lower prices for our products, which could adversely affect our revenues and margins. Our growth depends on our ability to extend our technologies into new product areas and industries beyond mobile handsets, including automotive and IoT, which necessitates substantial investments in research and development. We expect to continue making strategic investments and acquisitions to open new opportunities for our technologies and grow our patent portfolio. Our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is crucial, especially as we transition to a hybrid working environment post-pandemic. The competitive landscape is characterized by intense rivalry, particularly in China, where political actions may limit our ability to transact with certain customers or suppliers. We are subject to various legal and regulatory challenges that could adversely impact our business model and require significant management resources. Our revenues depend on the successful commercialization of 3G/4G/5G technologies, and we must maintain our intellectual property and technical leadership in these areas. We face challenges related to cybersecurity threats that could disrupt our IT systems and operations. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical, and our financial performance may fluctuate based on market dynamics and customer demand. We rely on third-party suppliers for the procurement and manufacturing of our products, and disruptions in supply chains could impact our ability to meet customer demand. Our research and development expenditures are expected to increase as we invest in advancements in 5G and application processor technologies. We may also need to adapt to new business models and transform aspects of our organization to successfully extend our technologies into new areas. The complexity of our products increases the likelihood of defects or security vulnerabilities, which could harm our reputation and relationships with customers. Our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights is critical, and we may face challenges in protecting our innovations from unauthorized use. Overall, our business strategy must align with evolving market conditions and technological advancements to sustain growth and competitive advantage.

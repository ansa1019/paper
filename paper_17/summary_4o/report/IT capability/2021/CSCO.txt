Our business, results of operations, and financial condition have been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused economic and financial disruptions globally. The pandemic has led to long-term changes in customer needs for our products and services, along with IT-related capital spending reductions or shifts in spending focus, that could materially adversely affect us if we are unable to adjust our product and service offerings to match customer needs. The transformation of our business to deliver more software and subscription offerings where revenue is recognized over time reflects our focus on enhancing our IT capabilities. We continue to invest in research and development to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely fashion, which is essential for maintaining our competitive advantage. The ability to develop and introduce new products and services into existing and emerging markets is critical for our operational efficiency and organizational effectiveness. Our strategy is to help our customers connect, secure, and automate to accelerate their digital agility in a cloud-first world, which underscores the importance of leveraging IT capabilities to meet evolving business needs. We have partnered with several of our key suppliers to address supply chain challenges, which highlights the need for effective resource allocation and management skills in our operations. The ongoing supply chain issues have resulted in increased costs and extended lead times, impacting our ability to fulfill customer demand and potentially harming our business performance. We are also exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates, which could adversely impact our financial performance. Our reliance on external relationships and the effectiveness of our IT governance are critical to managing risks associated with cybersecurity, data breaches, and regulatory compliance. The ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with other strategic resources is essential for achieving business value and maintaining market responsiveness. We continue to monitor the pandemic and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities, as the extent of its impact on our operational and financial performance remains uncertain. Our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers and contract manufacturers, which is closely linked to our IT systems and processes. The complexity of our operations necessitates a focus on process optimization and the integration of technology capabilities to enhance our overall performance. We face competition from numerous vendors in each product category, and the overall number of competitors providing niche product solutions may increase, further emphasizing the importance of our IT capabilities in maintaining a competitive edge. As we expand into new markets, we will face additional challenges related to our IT infrastructure and the need for effective technology deployment to meet customer expectations. Our strategic alliances with large organizations are designed to facilitate product compatibility and adoption of industry standards, but they also carry risks that could impact our operational capabilities.

We rely on information technology in all aspects of our business, including technology systems operated by us or under control of third parties. If we do not have sufficient capital or do not deploy sufficient capital in a timely manner to acquire, develop, or implement new technology or maintain or upgrade current systems, we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. We devote significant resources to protect our technology systems and proprietary data; however, we have experienced and will likely continue to experience varying degrees of cyber incidents in the normal course of business. There can be no assurance that the systems we have designed to prevent or limit the effects of cyber incidents or attacks will be sufficient to prevent or detect such incidents or attacks, or to avoid a material adverse impact on our systems after such incidents or attacks do occur. We may experience other operational or service difficulties related to network capacity, dramatic and unplanned fluctuations in our customers' demand for rail service, or other events that could negatively impact our operational efficiency, which could all have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. We are continually evaluating our financial condition and liquidity, and we expect to continue to make capital investments to improve operational performance and efficiency. Our initiatives will be informed by recommendations identified in the third-party assessment of the effectiveness of our safety program. We will continue transforming our railroad to increase reliability of our service product, reduce variability in network operations, and improve resource utilization. We expect volume to outpace industrial production as the results of our business development efforts are bringing new customers to our railroad. We expect to generate strong cash flow from operating activities allowing us to continue our industry-leading dividend payout ratio and strong share repurchase programs. Our capital plan includes investments in growth-related projects to drive more carloads to the network, continuous modernization of our locomotive fleet, and projects intended to improve operational efficiency. We will continue to utilize data to identify and mitigate risk, detect rail defects, and improve or close crossings. Our operating practices command center will continue the implementation of our predictive technology and reduce variability by identifying causes of mainline service interruptions and develop solutions. We expect our capital plan to be approximately $3.3 billion, up 10% from 2021, as we make investments to support our growth strategy. We will continue to harden our infrastructure, replace older assets, and improve the safety and resilience of the network. We face competition from other railroads and other transportation providers, and our main railroad competitor is Burlington Northern Santa Fe LLC. We are subject to cybersecurity risks, and a successful cyber-attack may result in significant service interruption, safety failure, operational difficulties, unauthorized access to confidential data, financial losses, regulatory fines, and misuse or corruption of critical data. We rely on information technology in all aspects of our business, and our ability to effectively manage and deploy IT resources is critical to our operational efficiency and competitive positioning.

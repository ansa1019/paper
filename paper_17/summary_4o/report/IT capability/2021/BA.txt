The commercial aircraft market is predominantly driven by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic, with significant impacts from global economic conditions, technological advances, and competitive pressures. The magnitude and duration of the global COVID-19 pandemic have adversely affected our operations, financial performance, and liquidity. We continue to transform and improve our business processes, which are designed to enhance operational efficiency and support our long-term strategic goals. Our commercial airplanes business faces intense competition, necessitating continuous improvements in product quality and operational capabilities to maintain market position. The integration of advanced information technology capabilities is critical to our operational flexibility and responsiveness to market dynamics. We leverage data analytics and information management systems to optimize our supply chain and enhance customer relationships. The ongoing challenges related to production disruptions and supply chain inefficiencies underscore the importance of effective IT governance and resource mobilization. Our defense, space & security segment is subject to unique risks associated with U.S. government contracts, which require stringent compliance with procurement regulations and performance standards. We are committed to leveraging our technology resources to enhance our competitive advantage and drive innovation across all business segments. Our global services segment is focused on providing comprehensive and cost-competitive product and service solutions, with an emphasis on utilizing digital technologies to improve service delivery and customer engagement. The evolving regulatory context and market conditions necessitate a proactive approach to strategic resource allocation and investment decisions, ensuring that we remain agile and responsive to both internal and external influences. We continue to monitor the health and stability of our supply chain as we ramp up production, recognizing that operational challenges could significantly impact our financial position and performance outcomes.

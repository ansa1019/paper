The impacts of COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread have affected our businesses in various ways, including disruptions to operations and changes in consumer behavior that challenge existing business models. Our businesses operate in highly competitive and dynamic industries, and our ability to compete effectively depends on our perceived image and reputation among various constituencies, including customers and business partners. The competition for cable communications' video services consists primarily of direct-to-consumer streaming and other over-the-top service providers, which has intensified as these providers seek to develop high-quality programming and acquire live sports programming to attract viewers. The ability of our businesses to compete effectively also depends on our management capability to anticipate or adapt to emerging competitors or changes in consumer behavior. Our success is largely dependent on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt, and leverage new and existing technologies, as well as our capacity to execute technology initiatives effectively. We continue to invest in technology infrastructure, including the deployment of new platforms and services, which are essential for enhancing customer experience and operational efficiency. The evolution of digital technologies and the increasing importance of broadband services have transformed consumer expectations and behaviors. Our investments in scalable infrastructure and technology resources are aimed at improving operational flexibility and supporting business innovation. The integration of technology capabilities into our value chain is critical for maintaining competitive advantage and responding to market dynamics. Additionally, we face challenges related to cybersecurity threats, which can negatively impact our ability to conduct business and protect confidential information. The reliance on third-party vendors for hardware, software, and operational support necessitates effective management of these relationships to mitigate risks associated with supply chain disruptions. Our strategic resource allocation decisions are influenced by the need to enhance our IT capabilities and ensure alignment with business strategies. The ongoing transformation of our businesses, including the development of new digital platforms, underscores the importance of IT governance and capability leverage in achieving organizational goals. We recognize that the competitive landscape is continually evolving, and our ability to adapt to these changes is essential for sustaining performance and driving growth. The integration of big data analytics and information management practices into our operations is crucial for enhancing decision-making speed and improving market responsiveness. As we navigate these challenges, our focus remains on leveraging technology to create business value and optimize performance outcomes across our segments.

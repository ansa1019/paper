Nike relies significantly on information technology to operate its business, including its supply chain and retail operations, and any failure, inadequacy, or interruption of that technology could harm its ability to effectively operate. The company is heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks across its supply chain, including product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales, and distribution. Information technology systems are critical to many of Nike's operating activities and business processes and may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown. The ability to effectively manage and maintain inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these information technology systems. Nike's ongoing work to integrate, secure, and enhance these systems and related processes in its global operations is a priority, and the company will continue to invest in these efforts. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, including as a result of security breaches, viruses, hackers, malware, natural disasters, vendor business interruptions, or other causes, could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of operations, potentially requiring significant capital investments to remediate the problem and adversely affecting reputation, results of operations, and financial condition. 

Nike's direct-to-consumer (DTC) operations have required substantial investment in information systems, inventory, and personnel. The company has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space, and certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and marketing activities. The company's digital commerce operations are increasingly important, and any failure on its part to provide attractive, effective, reliable, user-friendly digital commerce platforms could place it at a competitive disadvantage, resulting in lost sales and harm to its reputation. Nike's ability to engage in electronic communications globally between employees and third parties, including customers, suppliers, vendors, and consumers, is also reliant on information technology systems. Any interruption in these systems may impede the company's ability to engage in the digital space and result in lost revenues, damage to reputation, and loss of users. 

The company has implemented information technology systems in all geographical regions in which it operates, and its work to integrate these systems is ongoing. Nike's digital transformation strategy emphasizes the importance of leveraging digital technologies to drive growth, enhance consumer connections, and improve operational efficiencies. The company recognizes that the competitive nature of retail, including shifts in consumer shopping behaviors and the rising trend of digital commerce, constitutes a risk factor implicating its DTC and wholesale operations. The ability to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products is critical to maintaining or increasing revenues and profits, and the company must continuously adapt to a rapidly changing media environment, including reliance on social media and digital dissemination of advertising campaigns. 

Nike's commitment to product innovation and quality, along with its investments in design and marketing, is essential for maintaining and enhancing brand image and reputation. The company's strategic management practices include investments in consumer engagement that drive economic returns, infrastructure investments that improve operational efficiency, and investments in key areas of future growth, including its DTC business.

Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including the need to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes efficiently. The growth and expansion of our business place significant strain on our management, operational, and financial resources. We must continue to enhance our IT capabilities to effectively manage future growth and improve our systems, processes, and controls. Failure to manage growth effectively could disrupt existing end-customer relationships and harm our business performance. Our operating results may vary significantly, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. We face intense competition in our market, particularly from larger, well-established companies that may have greater name recognition, larger sales and marketing budgets, and broader distribution networks. Our competitors may leverage their relationships and incorporate functionality into existing products to gain business, which could adversely affect our market positioning. The enterprise security market is characterized by rapidly changing technologies and business plans, necessitating our ability to predict and respond to end-customers' changing needs. Our future success depends on our ability to extend our technology leadership, grow our base of end-customers, and expand deployment of our platform. We rely on our channel partners to sell substantially all of our products, and if these partners fail to perform, our ability to sell and distribute our products will be limited. We must also manage our sales channels effectively to ensure we can meet the demands of larger end-customers, which often require higher levels of support and have more stringent requirements. Our subscription and support revenue, which accounts for a significant portion of our total revenue, is recognized over the term of the relevant service period, and any decline in new or renewed contracts could negatively impact our revenue growth. We expect our operating expenses to increase as we continue to invest in our IT capabilities and expand our sales and marketing organizations. Our research and development expenses are expected to grow as we continue to invest in future products and services, and we anticipate that our overall effective tax rate may be impacted by changes in our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements. We have made significant investments in research and development to maintain our competitive position, and we believe that our ability to innovate and develop new features is essential for meeting the needs of our end-customers. Our reliance on manufacturing partners for our products exposes us to risks related to quality assurance, product costs, and supply chain management. We must also navigate the complexities of compliance with various governmental laws and regulations, which could impose additional costs and impact our operational efficiency. Our ability to attract, integrate, train, and retain qualified personnel is critical to our success, particularly in engineering and sales roles, as competition for skilled personnel is intense. We must also ensure that our internal controls over financial reporting remain effective to maintain investor confidence and comply with regulatory requirements.

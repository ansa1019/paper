We face intense competition as our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, with many competitors in different industries, including retail, e-commerce services, and digital content. Some of our competitors may secure better terms from vendors and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, and marketing. Our expansion into new products, services, and technologies subjects us to additional business and competitive risks, including new technology challenges. Our ability to manage growth effectively is critical, as it could damage our reputation and negatively affect our operating results. We expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we add employees and technology infrastructure, which supports our various product and service offerings. We seek to invest efficiently in technology and content, including AWS, to enhance the customer experience and improve process efficiencies. Our technology and content investment reflects our commitment to leverage technology capabilities to support business needs and operational efficiency. We also rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory and completed orders, which could negatively impact our operating results if we cannot negotiate acceptable terms or if they experience performance problems. Our international operations expose us to risks, including local economic and political conditions, government regulation of e-commerce, and limitations on technology infrastructure. We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, which are critical to our success, and we face risks related to system interruptions and lack of redundancy that could adversely affect our operating results. Our technology infrastructure must continually evolve to support our expanding business and customer demands. We rely on third-party technology and systems for various functions, and failures in these systems could expose us to risks of data loss or security breaches. We are subject to various procurement regulations related to our government contracts, which could impact our operational capabilities. Our ability to optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers is essential, as failure to do so could result in increased costs or harm our business. We have made significant investments in technology infrastructure to support our fulfillment operations and business growth. Our operating expenses reflect the investments we make in technology and content to enhance our offerings and improve operational efficiencies. The complexity of our business operations requires effective management of our technology resources and capabilities to maintain competitive advantage and meet customer expectations. We also face risks related to the integration of acquired businesses and technologies, which may present challenges in achieving anticipated benefits. Our strategic decisions regarding technology deployment and resource allocation are critical to our long-term success and operational effectiveness.

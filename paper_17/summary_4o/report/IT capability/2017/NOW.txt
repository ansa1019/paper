Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk, including the potential for significant losses. Our business could be harmed by various risks, including our ability to accurately predict and respond to rapidly evolving technological and market developments. The markets in which we compete have evolved rapidly, and the pace of innovation will continue to accelerate, as digital technologies increasingly become the basis for customer purchases. To compete effectively, we must identify and innovate in the right emerging technologies, accurately predict our customers' changing business needs, and efficiently integrate with other technologies within our customers' digital environments. Our operations involve the storage, transmission, and processing of our customers' confidential information, and we have security measures in place designed to protect this information. However, these measures may be breached, resulting in unauthorized access to our customers' data, which could harm our business and operating results. Delays in the release of new or updated products may slow the adoption of our technologies, reduce our ability to efficiently provide our services, and adversely impact sales. Our business depends upon the successful implementation of our products by our customers, and we increasingly rely on our network of partners to deliver implementation services. Disruptions or defects in our services could damage our customers' businesses and harm our reputation. We face intense competition in the markets for our enterprise cloud solutions, and our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new opportunities and technologies. Our ability to attract new customers and retain existing ones is critical to our business, and changes in our mix of products and services could impact our performance. We must continue to invest in our capacity to support anticipated growth, which may not result in increased revenues. Our financial results may vary significantly from period to period, and if we fail to meet financial performance expectations, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. We have made substantial investments in data centers and cloud computing infrastructure, which are essential for our operations. Our subscription revenues are primarily derived from fees that give customers access to our ordered subscription service, and we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract term. The adoption of new accounting standards, such as the revenue recognition standard under Topic 606, will impact our financial results and may result in greater variability in revenues. We expect to continue to incur losses due to increased costs, including non-cash charges associated with equity awards and amortization of purchased intangibles from acquisitions. Our success depends on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand, and we may face challenges related to intellectual property rights. Changes in laws and regulations affecting data privacy and the use of the internet may adversely affect our business. Our ability to manage risks associated with foreign markets and our investments in international operations is critical for our growth. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.

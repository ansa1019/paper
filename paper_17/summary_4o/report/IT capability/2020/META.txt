Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our ability to compete effectively is influenced by our capacity to build, maintain, and scale our technical infrastructure, which includes the coordination of our IT capabilities. The covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the shift of commerce from offline to online, increasing consumer demand for purchasing products, which in turn has increased demand for our advertising services. However, we anticipate that future advertising revenue growth will be determined by several factors, including the extent to which we continue to see increasing advertising demand and the impact of changes to the regulatory environment and third-party mobile operating systems and browsers that result in limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools. Our business is highly competitive, and we face significant competition in every aspect, including attracting and retaining users who engage with our products and services. We must continue to adapt our technology capabilities to meet evolving market dynamics and consumer demands. Our investments in technology infrastructure, including data centers and network capacity, are critical to supporting user growth and engagement. We have experienced challenges in operating with mobile operating systems, networks, and technologies that we do not control, which may negatively impact our user growth, engagement, and monetization. The integration of acquisitions requires significant time and resources, and our ability to successfully integrate complex acquisitions is unproven. Our reputation and ability to attract, retain, and serve our users depend upon the reliable performance of our products and our underlying technical infrastructure. We rely on data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control to deliver relevant and effective ads to our users. Any changes in our ability to use such signals will adversely affect our business. We also face risks related to the security of our systems, as our industry is prone to cyber-attacks by third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users' data. Our products and internal systems rely on software and hardware that is highly technical, and any errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities in these systems could adversely affect our business. We are subject to various laws and regulations related to cybersecurity and data protection, and our compliance with these requirements requires significant operational resources and modifications to our business practices. Our ability to effectively manage our growth is challenged by the increasing complexity of our operations and the need to maintain effective information technology systems. Our future income tax rates could be volatile and difficult to predict due to changes in jurisdictional profit split, changes in the amount and recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles. We anticipate that our available funds and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs and fund our share repurchase program for the foreseeable future.

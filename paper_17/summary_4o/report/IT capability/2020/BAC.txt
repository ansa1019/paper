The corporation's operational and security systems infrastructure, including computer systems, emerging technologies, data management, and internal processes, are integral to its performance. The corporation increasingly relies on its information technology infrastructure to operate its businesses remotely due to a work-from-home posture and evolving customer preferences, which includes increased reliance on digital banking and other digital services. Effective management of this posture depends on the security, reliability, and adequacy of such systems. The corporation's ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to third-party systems is limited, and any significant disruptions could adversely affect its business continuity status and result in disruption to its operations. The corporation has established various processes and controls to protect its systems and data from cyber threats, which include a comprehensive information security program designed to enable preventative, detective, and responsive measures to combat information and cybersecurity risks. The board and the enterprise risk committee provide oversight of cybersecurity and information security risks, while the global information security team manages the day-to-day implementation of the information security program. The corporation's risk management framework emphasizes the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities. The management of risk is dependent on the ability to consistently execute all elements of the risk management program and develop a culture of managing risk throughout the organization. The corporation's strategic plan is consistent with its risk appetite, capital plan, and liquidity requirements, specifically addressing strategic risks associated with technology developments and changing customer preferences. The corporation's risk framework includes clear roles, responsibilities, and accountability for the management of risk, which provides a blueprint for how the board establishes risk appetite and associated limits for activities. The management risk committee oversees key risks facing the corporation, including operational and compliance risks, and is responsible for maintaining exposures within established tolerance levels. The corporation's liquidity risk management practices include maintaining liquidity at the parent company and selected subsidiaries, determining appropriate liquidity amounts based on analysis of debt maturities and potential cash outflows, and diversifying funding sources. The corporation has developed and maintains contingency plans designed to prepare for potential adverse economic, financial, or market stress, which include monitoring and assessing liquidity needs. The corporation's credit risk management practices encompass funded and unfunded credit exposures, and it employs statistical techniques to assess and manage credit risk throughout the borrower's credit cycle. The impact of the pandemic has heightened operational, reputational, and compliance risks, necessitating rapid implementation of multiple pandemic relief programs. The corporation's ability to adapt and develop products, services, and technology to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences is critical to its success and competitive positioning. The corporation's investment in technology and digital infrastructure is essential for enhancing operational efficiency and maintaining market responsiveness.

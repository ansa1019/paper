The medical device markets in which we participate are highly competitive, and we encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold from various medical device companies. Digital technologies have and may continue to increase in their applicability and importance to various aspects of our business, operating and competitive environments, R&D pipeline, and product portfolio. We believe we will need to develop new and enhanced digital capabilities and competences in order to remain competitive. Our ability to manufacture our products is highly dependent on our ability to maintain the safety and health of our employees, which is influenced by external factors such as the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has caused disruptions in global supply chains and significant volatility, impacting our operations and financial performance. We have faced increased operational challenges from the need to protect employee health and safety, which include site shutdowns and workplace disruptions. Our operations-related risks include potential payment deferrals or other contract modifications, delays of deliveries, and lower demand for certain products and services. We expect that the longer the period of economic and global supply chain disruption continues, the more material the cumulative adverse impact will be on our business operations and financial performance. The medical device industry is characterized by extensive research and development and rapid technological change, necessitating our continued investment in the development or acquisition of scientifically advanced technologies and products. The ability to effectively support business needs through IT capabilities has become a key factor in transforming a firm into a competitive force. Our IT capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, and business process understanding to further organizational goals. We are also subject to extensive and dynamic medical device regulation, which may impede or hinder the approval or sale of our products. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections, which could delay production and lead to fines or other consequences. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has heightened many of the risks described in this report, including operational, customer-related, and employee-related risks. Our strategic acquisitions, investments, and alliances are intended to further expand our ability to offer customers effective, high-quality medical devices that satisfy their interventional needs. The success of our strategy relating to future acquisitions will depend on our ability to identify suitable opportunities, manage acquisition processes, and successfully integrate acquired businesses. Our restructuring and optimization initiatives are intended to enhance our growth potential and position us for long-term success, but they could yield unintended consequences such as distraction of management and reduced employee productivity. We continue to focus on the health and safety of patients, healthcare providers, and employees while executing our mission of transforming lives through innovative medical solutions.

The company's business, financial condition, and operating results can be affected by numerous factors, including global and regional economic conditions, which could materially adversely affect demand for the company's products and services. The company's ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services, and technologies to the marketplace. The company must make significant investments in research and development to support its IT capabilities and maintain its competitive advantage. The company believes that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to the company's core business strategy. The company's operational flexibility and ability to manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation are essential for maintaining its market position. The company is exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions, which can adversely impact its business by preventing access to online services and interfering with customer transactions. The company relies on third-party software developers, and the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends on developers' perceptions of the relative benefits of developing for the company's products compared to competitors' platforms. The company's reliance on access to third-party digital content may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, which could adversely impact its financial condition and operating results. The company has invested in manufacturing process equipment and has made prepayments to certain suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements, which help ensure the supply of components and finished goods. However, if these outsourcing partners experience severe financial problems or other disruptions, the continued supply can be reduced or terminated. The company's business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personally identifiable information, and it devotes significant resources to network and data security. Nevertheless, these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to confidential information could materially adversely affect the company's reputation, financial condition, and operating results. The company's operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which expose it to potential liabilities, increased costs, and other adverse effects on its business. The company's future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers and the continued availability of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The company believes that its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations. The company's financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies, which could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. The company's stock price is subject to volatility, and its financial condition and operating results depend substantially on its ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages.

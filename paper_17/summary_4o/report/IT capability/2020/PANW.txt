Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including the need to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner. The growth and expansion of our business and product offerings place a significant strain on our management, operational, and financial resources. We must continue to improve and expand our information technology capabilities to effectively manage future growth. Our existing systems, processes, and controls may not prevent or detect all errors, omissions, or fraud, and we may experience difficulties in managing improvements to these systems or in connection with third-party software. The impacts of COVID-19 may disrupt our operations and those of our end-customers and channel partners, which could negatively impact our ability to provide 24x7 worldwide support and/or replacement parts. Our ability to attract and retain new end-customers or sell additional products and subscriptions depends on various factors, including the budgeting cycles and purchasing practices of our end-customers. Our subscription and support revenue, which accounts for a significant portion of our total revenue, is recognized over the term of the relevant service period, and a decline in new or renewed contracts could negatively affect our revenue growth. We continue to invest in innovation and acquire businesses to extend the capabilities of our portfolio, which is essential for meeting the needs of our end-customers and improving our competitive position. Our growth strategy is dependent on increasing sales of our products, services, subscriptions, and offerings to medium and large enterprise end-customers, which involves risks such as competition from established vendors and longer sales cycles. We believe that our portfolio will enable us to benefit from recurring revenues as we continue to grow our installed end-customer base. Our future performance also depends on our ability to effectively manage our sales channels and provide high-quality technical support services, particularly for larger end-customers who have more complex networks. We must also navigate the challenges posed by evolving technological and market developments, including the need to adapt to changes in network infrastructure requirements and the increasing demand for cloud-based solutions. Our investments in research and development are critical to maintaining our competitive position, and we must continue to dedicate resources to these efforts. The success of our new features and products depends on various factors, including market acceptance and our ability to manage the risks associated with new product introductions. Our reliance on manufacturing partners for product assembly exposes us to risks related to quality assurance and supply chain disruptions. We are also subject to various environmental laws and regulations that could impact our operations and product offerings. Our ability to manage our supply chain effectively is crucial for meeting customer demand and maintaining operational efficiency. Overall, our IT capabilities, including our ability to leverage technology resources and manage information effectively, play a vital role in supporting our business strategies and achieving our organizational goals.

Nike relies significantly on information technology to operate its business, including its supply chain and retail operations, and any failure, inadequacy, or interruption of that technology could harm its ability to effectively operate. The company is heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks across its supply chain, including product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales, and distribution, as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes. Information technology systems are critical to many of its operating activities and business processes and may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown. The ability to effectively manage and maintain inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these information technology systems. Nike has implemented information technology systems in all geographical regions where it operates, and its work to integrate, secure, and enhance these systems and related processes in global operations is ongoing, with continued investment in these efforts. However, there is no assurance that the measures taken to secure and enhance these systems will be sufficient to protect against cyber-attacks, system failures, or data loss. The company has experienced cyber-attacks in the past and expects to continue to face such risks. The failure of these systems to operate effectively could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced operational efficiency, requiring significant capital investments to remediate issues, which may not cover all eventualities. Nike's digital platforms must be designed effectively and work well with various technologies, systems, networks, and standards that it does not control. A failure to provide attractive, effective, reliable, user-friendly digital commerce platforms that meet the changing expectations of online shoppers could place Nike at a competitive disadvantage. The company has made significant investments in digital technologies and information systems for its digital operations, and its digital offerings will require continued investment in the development and upgrading of technology platforms. The success of Nike's direct operations depends on the ability to deliver high-quality digital experiences and to adapt its digital platforms to accommodate increased consumer demand. The company has also recognized the need to unify investments in data and analytics, demand sensing, insight gathering, inventory management, and other areas against an end-to-end technology foundation to accelerate its digital transformation. The ongoing evolution of the retail landscape, driven by shifting consumer traffic patterns across digital and physical channels, necessitates that Nike continue to innovate and leverage its technology capabilities to maintain competitive advantage and effectively respond to market dynamics.

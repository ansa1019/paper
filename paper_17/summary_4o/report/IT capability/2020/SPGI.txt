The integration of our existing business with that of IHS Markit will depend significantly on our ability to successfully combine and integrate technology infrastructure, data management systems, and operational efficiencies without disrupting existing relationships with customers, suppliers, and employees. The anticipated benefits of the merger include synergies, cost savings, innovation, and technological opportunities, which are critical for enhancing our IT capabilities to support business needs. We have noted an increase in cyber threats targeted at our remote work environment, which highlights the importance of maintaining robust information technology resources and cybersecurity measures to protect sensitive data and ensure operational efficiency. Our business continuity program has been effective; however, the reliance on a remote working environment may expose us to operational risks and impact our productivity. The ability to provide timely and accurate information to users is essential for maintaining competitive advantage and supporting decision-making processes. The ongoing investment in technology capabilities, including data analytics and IT systems, is crucial for enhancing our market responsiveness and operational flexibility. We are committed to leveraging our IT architecture to improve customer relationships and streamline business processes, which will ultimately contribute to our organizational effectiveness and performance outcomes. The challenges associated with integrating the IT functions of both companies may require significant resources and management attention, potentially diverting focus from other strategic initiatives. Our technology management practices will be critical in navigating the complexities of this integration while ensuring that we continue to meet the evolving demands of our clients. The successful deployment of our technology portfolio will facilitate the optimization of our business operations and enhance our capability to respond to market dynamics. Additionally, the regulatory context surrounding our operations necessitates a robust IT governance framework to manage compliance and mitigate risks associated with data management and information security. The strategic alignment of our IT investments with our business objectives will be essential for achieving long-term performance gains and maintaining our position as a leader in the capital and commodities markets. The integration process will also involve harmonizing corporate cultures and operational practices, which are vital for fostering innovation and enhancing our competitive positioning in the marketplace. As we move forward, the focus will remain on advancing our technology functionalities and ensuring that our IT capabilities are aligned with our strategic goals, thereby driving value creation and enhancing our overall business resilience.

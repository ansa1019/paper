The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have materially affected how we and our customers are operating our businesses, which may impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance. The pandemic has caused strain for certain employees and may adversely impact productivity, including our ability to provide on-site consulting services to our customers, which could delay prospective customers' purchasing decisions. Our competitive position and results of operations could be harmed if we do not compete effectively, as the markets for our products and services are characterized by intense competition, evolving distribution models, and disruptive technology developments. Our future success will depend on our continued ability to enhance and integrate our existing products and services, introduce new products in a timely manner, and meet changing customer expectations. The process of developing and acquiring new technology products and services is complex, costly, and uncertain, and any delay in these efforts could result in customer attrition or impede our ability to attract new customers. We must make long-term investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products and services. Additionally, the expectations and needs of technology consumers are constantly evolving, and our future success depends on our ability to innovate and extend our core technology into new applications. Our digital experience segment is focused on delivering solutions for enterprise customers, which includes managing customer journeys and enabling shoppable experiences. Our offerings are designed to connect our comprehensive set of solutions, which enhances our competitive advantage. We have made significant investments to broaden the scale of our routes to market, and our recent financial results reflect the success of these investments. The integration of our products and services creates an increasingly complex ecosystem that is partly reliant on third parties. If any disruptive technology or competing products achieve widespread acceptance, our operating results could suffer. We rely on data centers managed both by Adobe and third parties to host and deliver our services, and any interruptions or delays in these hosted services could expose us to liability and harm our business. Security breaches in data centers we manage may compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of employee and customer data, which could expose us to liability and adversely affect our reputation. We devote significant resources to address security vulnerabilities, but these cannot be entirely eliminated. Our ability to acquire other businesses or technologies, make strategic investments, or integrate acquired businesses effectively may also be impaired by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and other external factors. The complexity of our sales cycles for enterprise offerings can make our sales cycles unpredictable, and we spend substantial time and expense on our sales efforts without assurance that potential customers will ultimately purchase our solutions. If we cannot continue to develop, acquire, market, and offer new products or enhancements that meet customer requirements, our operating results could suffer. Our reliance on third-party customer service providers presents risks to our business, as we may not be able to influence the quality of support directly. If we encounter problems with these providers, our reputation may be harmed, and we could lose customers and associated revenue.

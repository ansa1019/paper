Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins. Competition in the technology sector involves competitors ranging from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized firms. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and consumers. We derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on PCs, facing significant competition from platforms developed for new devices such as smartphones and tablets. Competing platforms have content and application marketplaces with scale and significant installed bases, making the variety and utility of content and applications available on a platform important to device purchasing decisions. Our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building best-in-class platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with artificial intelligence. We are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies, ensuring our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data. Our increasing focus on cloud-based services presents execution and competitive risks, and our success in cloud-based services depends on our ability to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers. We are making significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the Windows operating system and Microsoft 365. Developing new technologies is complex and can require long development and testing periods, with significant delays adversely affecting our revenue. Our internal IT environment continues to evolve, and we embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking. Security of our information technology is critical, as threats can take various forms, including cyberattacks that may disrupt the security of our systems and business applications. We must continuously engineer more secure products and services and enhance security and reliability features to protect our customers' data. The development of the Internet of Things presents security, privacy, and execution risks, and our handling of IoT data may not satisfy customers or regulatory requirements. We are building AI into many of our offerings, which presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption and our business. Our increasing user traffic and growth in services demand more computing power, requiring substantial investments to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment. Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees, and maintaining our brand and reputation is crucial for recruiting and retaining skilled workers. Our global operations expose us to operational and economic risks, and adverse economic conditions may harm our business. We strive to empower all people and organizations to achieve more, and the accessibility of our products is an important aspect of this goal.

The company is increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology and infrastructure. A significant breakdown, invasion, corruption, destruction or interruption of critical information technology systems or infrastructure could negatively impact operations.

The company monitors its data, information technology and personnel usage of company systems to reduce these risks. The company recognizes that it has an important role to play in helping to improve access to its products around the world, which includes a set of principles that guide the company's worldwide approach to expanding access to health care. The company is committed to making externally sourced programs a greater component of its pipeline strategy, with a renewed focus on supplementing its internal research with a licensing and external alliance strategy. The company also reviews its pipeline to examine candidates which may provide more value through out-licensing. The company is well positioned to compete in the search for technological innovations, emphasizing research and development, and is active in acquiring and marketing products through external alliances. The company believes that its investments in emerging markets will enhance its operational capabilities and competitive positioning.

The company's clinical pipeline includes candidates in multiple disease areas, and it has established investment guidelines for its pension and other postretirement plans to create an asset allocation that is expected to deliver a rate of return sufficient to meet long-term obligations. The company is also subject to a significant number of privacy and data protection laws and regulations globally, and it has adopted a comprehensive global privacy program to manage these evolving risks. The company engages in public policy advocacy with policymakers and continues to work to demonstrate that its medicines provide value to patients and to those who pay for health care, which includes efforts to mitigate the impact of health care cost containment pressures. The company anticipates that pricing pressures and market access challenges will continue in emerging markets, which could affect its ability to realize continued growth.

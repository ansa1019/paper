We have experienced dramatic declines in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products which have adversely affected our business. Our gross margins are dependent upon continuing decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes, including reducing the die size of our existing products. Factors that may limit our ability to reduce costs include strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix, the increasing complexity of manufacturing processes, technological barriers, and changes in process technologies. The semiconductor memory industry is highly competitive, and we face intense competition from a number of companies that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets, invest in technology, and capitalize on growth opportunities. Our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity, improve yields, reduce die size, and minimize mask levels in their product designs.

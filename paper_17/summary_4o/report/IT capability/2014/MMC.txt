The company faces rapid technological changes and must adequately anticipate or respond to these changes or successfully implement strategic initiatives to address them, as failure to do so could adversely affect its business and results of operations. To remain competitive, the company must identify the most current technologies and methodologies and integrate them into its service offerings. The company engages in strategic initiatives involving investments in technology systems and infrastructure to support its growth strategy. This includes deploying new processes and changing the way colleagues perform certain roles to capture efficiencies. The company is subject to extensive regulation under various laws, including those related to data privacy and cybersecurity, which impose significant technology and compliance costs. The improper disclosure of confidential, personal, or proprietary data could result in regulatory scrutiny, legal liability, or reputational harm, and could have a material adverse effect on the business. The company maintains confidential information that is subject to risks of improper disclosure or misuse, either due to human error or cyberattacks. The age of some technology, along with the increased use of mobile devices and online services, contributes to the risk of information misuse. The company is increasingly subject to new or changing laws related to the collection, use, transfer, retention, security, and management of information, which impose significant technology and compliance costs. The company has experienced data incidents involving confidential information, including breaches from human error and unauthorized access, which could disrupt business and damage reputation. The company engages in periodic testing and maintains policies and technical safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of confidential information. However, testing efforts may not discover all system deficiencies, and the company may not be able to fully remediate deficiencies in a timely manner. Significant costs are involved in maintaining safeguards for the technology infrastructure, and failure to efficiently and effectively maintain and upgrade these safeguards could have a material adverse effect on the business. The company also faces challenges related to the integration of acquisitions, which may require substantial increases in costs to comply with laws and regulations. The company’s operations depend on its ability to protect its technology infrastructure against damage from events that could disrupt operations. The ability to effectively support business needs through IT capabilities has become a key factor in transforming the firm into a competitive force. The company’s IT capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible IT resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, and management skills to further organizational goals. The company’s ability to leverage IT capabilities effectively is critical for maintaining competitive advantage and achieving operational efficiency.

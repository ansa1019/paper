We depend heavily on contracts with the U.S. government, with 79% of our consolidated net sales derived from this sector. Our information systems & global solutions (IS&GS) business segment has been impacted by the downturn in federal agencies' information technology budgets and increased re-competition on existing contracts, which have been fragmented into smaller contracts awarded primarily on the basis of price. The competitive environment in information technology and cybersecurity has intensified, particularly from non-traditional competitors outside the aerospace and defense industry. We face increased market pressures in our services businesses, including lower in-theater support and the fragmentation of large contracts. Our strategy includes maintaining strong customer relationships and providing advanced technology solutions to meet mission objectives efficiently and affordably. We continue to invest in technologies to fulfill new mission requirements for our customers and enhance our information technology capabilities. Our IS&GS segment provides integrated information technology solutions and management services across a broad spectrum of applications for civil, defense, intelligence, and other government customers. The ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access is critical to our operational efficiency and effectiveness. We recognize the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to transform our firm into a competitive force. Our IT capabilities have evolved to encompass the coordination of our assets and internal processes, as well as interfirm transactions and relationships. We are engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products, and services. Our investment decisions are influenced by the need to adapt to changing business needs and directions, and we continuously seek to enhance our operational flexibility and market agility through strategic resource allocation. The competitive bidding process for contracts entails substantial costs and managerial time, and we must manage our technology infrastructure effectively to maintain our competitive advantage. We have a diverse range of defense, homeland security, and information technology products and services, which positions us to mitigate the impact of budget reductions on our operating results. Our ability to recover costs related to our defined benefit pension plans through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. government contracts is crucial for our financial performance. We also focus on enhancing our organizational capabilities and strategic alignment to ensure we meet the evolving demands of our customers while navigating the complexities of government procurement policies and market dynamics.

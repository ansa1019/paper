Nike relies significantly on information technology to operate its business, including supply chain and retail operations, and any failure, inadequacy, or interruption of that technology could harm its ability to effectively operate. The company is heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks across its supply chain, including product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales, and distribution, as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes. The ongoing integration and enhancement of these systems and related processes in global operations are critical, as any failure of these systems to operate effectively or problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of operations. Furthermore, the company utilizes information technology systems for digital marketing, digital commerce, and the marketing and use of digital sport products, which are essential for maintaining consumer connections and driving sales. The reliance on advanced information technology capabilities underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources and capabilities to transform the firm into a competitive force. The complexity of Nike's information systems, including those related to demand and supply planning and inventory control, presents challenges that could lead to interruptions in data and information technology systems. Additionally, the company faces risks associated with data security and privacy, as breaches could result in the loss of valuable business data, misappropriation of personal information, and damage to customer relationships and reputation. The effectiveness of Nike's information technology capabilities is also linked to its ability to manage and maintain inventory, ship products to customers on a timely basis, and comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal, and tax requirements. The companyâ€™s commitment to investing in digital capabilities and infrastructure is crucial for supporting current and future growth, as well as enhancing operational efficiency. Challenges in managing these IT capabilities could adversely affect Nike's financial performance and operational flexibility. The strategic management of information technology resources is essential for achieving operational excellence, improving working capital efficiency, and driving long-term revenue growth. The integration of IT capabilities into business processes is vital for maintaining competitive advantage and responding to market dynamics, as well as for facilitating effective communication and collaboration across the organization and with external partners.

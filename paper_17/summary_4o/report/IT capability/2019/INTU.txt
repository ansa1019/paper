Our ability to adapt to technological changes and global trends is critical for future revenue growth, as we operate in industries characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, and frequent new product introductions. We must continue to innovate and develop new products and features to meet changing customer needs and attract and retain talented software developers. The ongoing operation and availability of our platforms and systems, as well as those of our external service providers, is becoming increasingly important as we offer more online services. We are investing significant management attention and resources in our information technology infrastructure and in our privacy and security capabilities. Our investment in security measures is essential to protect our customers against fraud, particularly in our consumer and professional tax offerings. We face significant risks in maintaining adequate service levels during peak periods when we derive a substantial portion of our overall revenue. Any interruptions in our online tax preparation or electronic filing service during critical times could result in significantly decreased revenue, lost customers, and increased operating costs. We rely on various third-party partners, including software and service providers, to deliver our offerings and operate our business. The failure of third parties to provide acceptable and high-quality products, services, and technologies may result in a disruption to our business operations and our customers. Our growth is increasingly dependent on the strength of our business relationships and our ability to continue to develop, manage, and maintain new and existing relationships with third-party partners. We are continually investing resources to update and improve our internal information technology systems and software platforms to meet existing needs and the growing requirements of our business and customers. If we experience prolonged delays or unforeseen difficulties in updating and upgrading our systems and architecture, we may experience outages and may not be able to deliver certain offerings and develop new offerings and enhancements that we need to remain competitive. Our technologies, systems, and networks have been subject to cyberattacks, computer viruses, and other cybersecurity incidents that could result in unauthorized access to sensitive and personal data. We are increasingly incorporating open-source software into our products, which may introduce vulnerabilities that make our offerings susceptible to cyberattacks. We must continue to develop our skills, tools, and capabilities to capitalize on existing and emerging technologies, which requires us to devote significant resources. Our operational risks arise from internal and external events relating to systems, processes, and people, including potential security incidents and privacy concerns. We have devoted significant resources to develop products and services for users of mobile devices, but the versions of our products and services developed for these devices may not be compelling to users. If we are slow to develop products and technologies that are compatible with mobile devices, or if our competitors achieve those results more quickly, we will fail to capture a significant share of an increasingly important portion of the market for online services. Our business depends on our strong reputation and the value of our brands, and any security incident that results in unauthorized disclosure of our customers' sensitive data could cause material reputational harm. We are subject to various legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory inquiries that may arise in the ordinary course of our business, which could divert significant resources and harm our financial results.

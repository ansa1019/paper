In the course of conducting our business operations, we are exposed to a variety of risks, including those related to market dynamics and competition, which may affect our liquidity, competitive position, and overall business performance. Our operational and security systems infrastructure, including our computer systems, emerging technologies, and data management, are integral to our performance and are subject to risks such as cyber attacks, which could disrupt critical business operations and customer services. The corporation's ability to manage, aggregate, interpret, and use data accurately and timely is essential for effective risk reporting and management. We continuously update our systems to support our operations and growth, which entails significant costs and risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones. Our business relies on effective access management and the secure collection, processing, transmission, storage, and retrieval of confidential information in our systems and networks, as well as those of third parties. Additionally, we are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations regarding data management and privacy, which necessitate continuous improvement in our detection and reporting capabilities. Our risk management framework is designed to minimize risk and loss, incorporating strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational, and reputational risks. We employ various models and strategies to assess and control our market risk exposures, which are subject to inherent limitations. The corporation's risk appetite indicates the amount of capital, earnings, or liquidity we are willing to put at risk to achieve our strategic objectives. Our strategic plan is consistent with our risk appetite, capital plan, and liquidity requirements, and specifically addresses strategic risks. The corporation's overall capacity to take risk is limited, necessitating prioritization of risks to maintain a strong financial position. Our risk framework requires strong risk management practices to be integrated into key strategic, capital, and financial planning processes. We utilize various risk mitigation techniques, including the use of credit derivatives to cover funded and unfunded exposures. Our commercial credit risk is evaluated and managed to ensure that concentrations of credit exposure align with our risk appetite. We monitor credit risk in our portfolios and refine our underwriting and credit risk management practices to meet changing economic conditions. The allowance for loan and lease losses is established based on historical loss experience, internal risk ratings, and current economic conditions. We also assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses based on total credit exposure, which includes loans, leases, and unfunded lending commitments. Our liquidity risk management objective is to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral needs while supporting our businesses under various economic conditions. We maintain a diversified funding profile and utilize various funding sources to support our lending activities. Our liquidity position is monitored regularly to ensure compliance with established risk tolerance levels. The corporation's IT capabilities have evolved to encompass the coordination of assets and internal processes, enhancing our ability to respond to changing business needs and directions.

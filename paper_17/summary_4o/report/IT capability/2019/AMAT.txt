The industries that Applied serves can be volatile and difficult to predict, and demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on several factors, including the nature and timing of technology inflections and advances in fabrication processes. To meet rapidly changing demand, Applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity across its businesses. Applied is exposed to risks associated with operating a global business, including the need to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations around the world. The company must effectively manage a diverse workforce and maintain appropriate business processes, procedures, and internal controls. Applied's ability to successfully expand into new and related markets and industries may be adversely affected by the complexity of managing multiple businesses with variations in production planning, execution, supply chain management, and logistics. The development, introduction, and support of a broadening set of products in a geographically diverse and competitive environment have grown more complex and expensive over time. To compete successfully, Applied must identify and address technology inflections, market changes, competitor innovations, new applications, customer requirements, and end-use demand in a timely and effective manner. Applied's future operating results depend to a considerable extent on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the equipment and service products it provides. The company must enhance its worldwide operations across its businesses to reduce cycle time, enable continuous quality improvement, reduce costs, and enhance design for manufacturability and serviceability. Applied's significant investments in research, development, and engineering are critical to delivering new products and technologies that meet current and projected requirements. The company must accurately forecast demand, work with suppliers, and meet production schedules for its products, which is essential for maintaining operational efficiency and achieving performance gains. Applied is exposed to risks associated with business combinations, acquisitions, strategic investments, and divestitures, which involve numerous risks to its business, financial condition, and operating results. The failure to effectively manage a diverse workforce and the increasing need for a mobile workforce to work in or travel to different regions may also impact the company's operational flexibility. Additionally, Applied must continue to invest in research and development to support its customers and capitalize on opportunities, which can have a negative impact on its operating margins and earnings. The company is also exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and incidents, as it collects, uses, transmits, and stores data on information technology systems. Compliance with laws and regulations concerning privacy and information security could result in significant expense, and any failure to comply could result in proceedings against Applied by regulatory authorities. The failure to successfully implement enterprise resource planning and other information systems changes could adversely impact Applied's business and results of operations, highlighting the importance of effective information management capability in supporting business strategies and work processes.

Nike is heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks, including the internet and third-party services, across its supply chain, including product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales and distribution, as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes. The company's ability to effectively manage and maintain its inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these information technology systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, including as a result of security breaches, viruses, hackers, malware, natural disasters, vendor business interruptions or other causes, could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of operations, which may have an adverse effect on reputation, results of operations, and financial condition. Nike's commitment to investments in data and analytics capabilities, digital commerce platforms, and an initial investment in a new enterprise resource planning tool is aimed at accelerating its end-to-end digital transformation. The company has implemented information technology systems in all geographical regions where it operates, and its ongoing work to integrate, secure, and enhance these systems and related processes is critical to its operational capabilities. Additionally, Nike's digital commerce operations have required substantial investment in information systems and personnel, reflecting the importance of technology in supporting its business strategy. The company recognizes that any failure, inadequacy, or interruption of its technology could harm its ability to effectively operate its business. The competitive nature of retail, including shifts in consumer behavior towards digital commerce, constitutes a risk factor implicating Nike's operations. The company also faces challenges related to consumer data security, as it handles sensitive and proprietary business information, as well as personal information about its customers. The increasing sophistication of hackers and data thieves poses a significant risk to Nike's information security. Furthermore, compliance with complex regulatory standards regarding data protection, such as the General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, adds to the operational challenges. Nike's reliance on information technology extends to its digital marketing, consumer engagement, and the marketing and use of its digital products and services. Any interruption in information technology systems may impede the company's ability to engage in the digital space and result in lost revenues, damage to reputation, and loss of users. The company continues to invest in its technology capabilities to enhance operational efficiency and maintain competitive advantage in the rapidly evolving market landscape. The integration of technology into its business processes is essential for achieving long-term revenue growth and profitability, as well as for building deep personal consumer connections with its brands.

Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk, particularly related to our ability to grow our business in intensely competitive markets. The markets for our enterprise cloud solutions are rapidly evolving and highly competitive, with relatively low barriers to entry. As the market for digital workflow products matures and new technologies and competitors enter the market, we expect competition to intensify. Our current competitors include large, well-established enterprise application software vendors and new entrants developing technologies to solve similar problems. Many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current enterprise software, which may make them reluctant to migrate to our solutions. Competitors may respond more quickly and effectively to new or changing opportunities, technologies, and customer requirements, potentially utilizing acquisitions or integrations to offer enhanced functionality or other advantages. We must identify and innovate in the right emerging technologies, accurately predict our customers' changing business needs, and invest in our technology platform to meet high performance expectations. Our ability to deliver new, scalable platform technologies and efficiently integrate with other technologies within our customers' digital environments is critical. If we fail to meet these requirements, our competitive position may be harmed. Privacy laws and concerns, evolving regulation of cloud computing, and data transfer restrictions may adversely affect our business, limiting our ability to develop products and services to maximize their utility. Changing laws and regulations could impact our ability to store, process, and share data with our customers, potentially restricting our ability to offer services in certain locations. Our success depends on the implementation of our products by our customers, and we rely on our network of partners to deliver these services. However, there may not be enough qualified implementation partners available to meet customer demand, and delays or errors in implementations could result in significant costs and reputational harm. We face risks related to cybersecurity, as our operations involve the storage and processing of sensitive data. A security breach could disrupt our services, lead to litigation, and result in significant liabilities. Our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel is essential for our success, particularly in a competitive labor market for technology professionals. Additionally, we are subject to various regulatory requirements, especially in heavily regulated industries, which may limit our ability to continue or expand our business. Our financial performance may vary significantly from period to period, influenced by factors such as customer demand, competitive actions, and changes in market conditions. We must manage our investments in technology and infrastructure effectively to support our growth and maintain operational efficiency. Our reliance on a network of partners for revenue generation and service delivery introduces additional risks, as their performance directly impacts our ability to sell and distribute our products. As we expand internationally, we face different regulatory, political, and economic risks that could adversely affect our business. Our future performance is contingent upon our ability to navigate these challenges while continuing to innovate and enhance our technology capabilities.

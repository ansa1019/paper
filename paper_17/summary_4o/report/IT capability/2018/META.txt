Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including the ability to retain existing users or add new users, which is critical to our success. Our financial performance has been significantly determined by our success in adding, retaining, and engaging active users of our products. If users do not perceive our products to be useful, reliable, and trustworthy, we may not be able to attract or retain users or maintain or increase their engagement. Changes in user behavior, including decreases in the quality and frequency of content shared, could negatively affect user retention and engagement. We face significant competition from companies that provide social media and communication products, which may have greater resources or stronger competitive positions. Our ability to compete effectively depends on factors such as the popularity, usefulness, performance, and reliability of our products compared to competitors. Our advertising revenue, which is substantially generated from third parties, could be adversely affected by decreases in user engagement or by our inability to maintain or grow usage of our applications. The substantial majority of our revenue is generated from advertising on mobile devices, and we are dependent on the interoperability of our products with popular mobile operating systems and networks that we do not control. Any changes, bugs, or technical issues in these systems could adversely affect the usage of our products. Our business is highly competitive, and we compete with companies that replicate our capabilities and may undertake more successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns. Our ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees, particularly in technology roles, is critical to our success. We are investing in our technical infrastructure, including data centers and network capacity, to support user growth and engagement. Our investments in safety, security, and content review are aimed at combating misuse of our services and user data. We continuously evaluate our user metrics, including daily and monthly active users, which are critical to understanding our performance and guiding our strategic decisions. Our research and development expenses are primarily driven by the growth in employee headcount in engineering and technical functions, which is essential for building and improving our products. We anticipate that our investments in technology initiatives, including artificial intelligence and virtual reality, will further our mission and enhance our competitive positioning. Our financial results are influenced by various factors, including changes in advertising demand, user engagement, and the effectiveness of our ad products. The complexity of our operations, including international expansion and compliance with diverse regulatory environments, presents ongoing challenges that could impact our financial performance and operational efficiency.

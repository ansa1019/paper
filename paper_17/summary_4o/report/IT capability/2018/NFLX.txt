Our ability to provide our members with compelling content choices, as well as a quality experience for selecting and viewing TV series and movies, is critical to our business strategy and operational effectiveness. We continually face competition from various entertainment video providers, which necessitates a strong IT capability to support our business needs and enhance our market positioning. The market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change, requiring us to adapt our technology resources and capabilities to maintain operational flexibility and responsiveness to market dynamics. We are expanding our operations internationally and scaling our streaming service to effectively manage anticipated growth in both members and features related to our service. This includes developing technology and utilizing third-party cloud computing services, which are integral to our IT infrastructure and operational efficiency. Our reliance on Amazon Web Services for cloud computing highlights the importance of robust IT systems in delivering our streaming content efficiently. The integration of proprietary and third-party technology is essential for our operations, including the recommendation and merchandising technology that enables us to predict and recommend titles to our members. Any disruption in these systems could adversely impact our ability to attract and retain members, thus affecting our overall business performance. We also face risks related to cybersecurity threats, which could result in unauthorized access to our systems and data, potentially harming our reputation and operational integrity. Our investment in technology and development reflects our commitment to enhancing our IT capabilities, which includes improvements to our user interface and streaming delivery technology. The increase in technology and development expenses is primarily due to personnel-related costs and third-party expenses associated with cloud computing. As we continue to invest in original content, we are also building out expertise in various disciplines, including technology management and operational practices, to support our growth and transformation initiatives. Our marketing strategies leverage technology to promote our content and drive viewing by our members, underscoring the role of IT in our business process management. The contractual obligations related to streaming content obligations and the long-term nature of our commitments necessitate a strategic approach to resource allocation and investment decisions, ensuring that we can adapt to changes in our business environment. Our ability to manage change and growth effectively is contingent upon our IT capabilities, which must evolve to meet the demands of a dynamic market and enhance our competitive advantage. The complexities of our international operations require us to navigate various regulatory environments and consumer preferences, further emphasizing the need for strong IT governance and strategic alignment with our business objectives. As we face challenges in maintaining our competitive positioning, our IT capabilities will play a crucial role in enabling us to respond to external influences and optimize our operational processes.

Our operating results may fluctuate in future periods, which may adversely affect our stock price. These fluctuations are subject to numerous factors, including changes in demand for our products and services, particularly in service providers and internet businesses, due to changes in the global economic environment. The introduction and market acceptance of new technologies and products, as well as our success in new and evolving markets, are critical to our IT capabilities. We have been investing and expect to continue to invest in key priority and growth areas, including security and applications, while maintaining leadership in infrastructure platforms and services. However, the return on these investments may be lower or develop more slowly than expected. Our ability to achieve targeted cost reductions and the benefits anticipated from our investments in engineering, sales, service, and marketing are essential for enhancing our IT capabilities. We face challenges in the communications and networking industries, including price competition and the need for operational flexibility in response to market dynamics. The transformation of our business to deliver more software and subscription offerings is part of our strategy to enhance our IT capabilities and maintain competitive advantage. Our revenue may grow at a slower rate than in past periods or decline, particularly in the service provider market, where we have experienced significant weakness. The timing, size, and mix of customer orders can significantly affect our business and operating results, particularly in emerging markets. Our strategic initiatives and investments are designed to enable the increased use of the network as a platform for automating, orchestrating, integrating, and delivering IT-based products and services. We must commit significant resources to develop new technology and respond to emerging technological trends and customers' changing needs. Our strategy is to lead our customers in their digital transition with solutions that deliver greater agility, productivity, security, and other advanced network capabilities. The growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market, increasing the competitive landscape. We also rely on our channel partners globally to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, as any failure could adversely affect our business. Our ability to manage distribution effectively is critical to maintaining our sales and margins. The markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change, converging technologies, and a migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages. Our IT capabilities are essential in navigating these competitive forces and in achieving our organizational goals. We continue to assess the sustainability of improvements in emerging markets, and our future results could be materially adversely affected by various political, economic, or other factors. The inherent nature of networking requires interoperability, necessitating effective management of complicated relationships with customers, suppliers, and strategic alliance partners. Our investments in IT capabilities and strategic resources are aimed at enhancing our organizational effectiveness and ensuring we meet the evolving needs of our customers.

We rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations, including for administrative functions, point-of-sale processing and payment in our stores and online, management of our supply chain, and various other processes and transactions. Our ability to effectively manage our business, launch digital and other initiatives, and coordinate the production, distribution, administration, and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability, integrity, and capacity of these systems. We continue to make significant investments in technology, third-party services, and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and to prevent or minimize breaches of our information technology systems or data loss. Many of our information technology systems contain personal, financial, or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and employees, and the unauthorized access, use, theft, or destruction of this information could impact our reputation and brand and expose us to potential liability and loss of revenues. Our success depends substantially on the value of our brands, and failure to preserve their value could negatively impact our financial results. Additionally, we believe that our strategic initiatives, including driving convenience, brand engagement, and digital relationships through our mobile, loyalty, delivery, and digital capabilities, are crucial for future growth. The success of these initiatives is highly dependent on our technology systems. We are consistently subject to attempts to compromise our information technology systems, and to the extent we experience a material breach, it could result in a material loss of revenues and adversely impact our reputation and brand. Our operational flexibility and ability to respond to market dynamics are influenced by our IT capabilities, which have evolved to encompass the coordination of our assets and internal processes. Furthermore, we face challenges in attracting and retaining qualified technology systems developers necessary to implement new technologies for our growth initiatives, including increasing our digital relationships with customers. The effectiveness of our IT governance and the management of our technology resources are critical for achieving our organizational goals and maintaining operational efficiency. Our strategic resource allocation, including investments in technology infrastructure and digital transformation, is essential for enhancing our business processes and overall performance. The integration of our IT capabilities with our business strategies is vital for maintaining competitive advantage and achieving market responsiveness. As we continue to expand our global operations, the ability to leverage our IT capabilities will be instrumental in navigating the complexities of international markets and ensuring compliance with evolving regulatory contexts. The interplay between our technology capabilities and organizational effectiveness will ultimately shape our capacity for innovation and long-term success in a rapidly changing business environment.

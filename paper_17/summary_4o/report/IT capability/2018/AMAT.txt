The industries that Applied serves can be volatile and difficult to predict, with demand for manufacturing equipment and services changing depending on technology inflections and advances in fabrication processes. Applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity across its businesses, which may incur unexpected costs to align its operations. During periods of increasing demand, Applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand and effectively manage its supply chain, while during decreasing demand, it must reduce costs and align its cost structure with market conditions. Applied's business performance and results may be adversely impacted if it does not effectively manage these challenges. The company is exposed to risks associated with an uncertain global economy, which can affect customer spending and investment in manufacturing equipment. Economic uncertainty may lead to customers scaling back operations or exiting businesses, which could adversely impact Applied's revenues and financial condition. Applied's ability to compete effectively is challenged by uncertain economic and industry conditions, which complicate its ability to forecast operating results and make strategic decisions. The company must continue to invest in research and development to support its customers and compete effectively, even during periods of economic uncertainty. Applied's operations are distributed globally, and its performance may be adversely affected by various factors, including political and social attitudes, trade policies, and supply chain interruptions. The company must maintain appropriate business processes and internal controls across its diverse operations to comply with regulatory requirements. Applied's success depends significantly on its ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees with key skills and experience, which is vital for executing its global strategies and maintaining a culture of innovation. The company is also exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats, as it collects and stores data on its information technology systems. Any disruption or breach of these systems could result in business disruption, reputational damage, and increased costs. Applied periodically implements new enterprise resource planning and information systems to better manage its operations, and any failure to successfully implement these systems could adversely impact its business. The company recognizes the importance of mobilizing and deploying IT-based resources in combination with leveraging other resources and capabilities to transform into a competitive force. Applied's IT capabilities must evolve to encompass the coordination of its assets and internal processes, as well as interfirm transactions and relationships, to enhance its business strategies and work processes. The companyâ€™s investments in technology and innovation are critical for maintaining its competitive advantage and addressing the complexities of the semiconductor and display industries.

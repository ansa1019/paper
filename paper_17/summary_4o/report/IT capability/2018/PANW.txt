Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including the need to effectively manage future growth and improve our information technology and financial infrastructure, operational and administrative systems, and controls. The growth and expansion of our business place significant strain on our management, operational, and financial resources, necessitating improvements to our systems and processes. We may not be able to successfully implement or scale improvements to our systems, processes, and controls in an efficient or timely manner. Additionally, our existing systems may not prevent or detect all errors, omissions, or fraud, which could disrupt our existing end-customer relationships and harm our business performance. Our revenue growth rate may not be indicative of future performance, as we have experienced significant fluctuations in our financial results due to various factors, including our ability to attract and retain end-customers and changes in market needs. We face intense competition in our market, particularly from larger, well-established companies that may have greater resources and broader product offerings, which could impact our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position. Our future success depends on our ability to expand the deployment of our platform with existing end-customers and to effectively manage improvements to our systems and processes. We rely on our channel partners to sell substantially all of our products, and any failure by these partners to perform could limit our ability to sell and distribute our products and subscriptions. Our ability to manage production and manufacturing-related costs, as well as our global customer service organization costs, is critical to our operational efficiency. We must continue to invest in research and development to enhance our technology capabilities and meet the evolving needs of our end-customers. Our growth strategy is dependent on increasing sales of our products to medium and large enterprise end-customers, which involves risks such as competition from larger competitors and longer sales cycles. We must also navigate challenges related to our supply chain and manufacturing partners, as disruptions could adversely affect our ability to fulfill customer orders and maintain operational efficiency. Our investments in innovation and technology deployment are essential for sustaining growth and improving our competitive position. We believe that our ability to effectively manage our information technology resources and capabilities will be crucial in transforming our firm into a competitive force. The architecture of our platform is designed to provide superior performance and reduce the total cost of ownership for organizations by simplifying security operations and infrastructure. We continue to monitor our deferred revenue balance, which represents a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods, as it is primarily derived from subscription and support offerings. Our strategic resource allocation and operational flexibility will be key in addressing the challenges we face and in achieving our organizational goals.

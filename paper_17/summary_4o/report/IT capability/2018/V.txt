As a global payments technology company, we are subject to complex and evolving regulations that govern our operations, which could limit our ability to enforce our payments system rules and require us to adopt new rules or change existing rules. The evolving regulatory focus on the payments industry could negatively impact our ability to use our intellectual property to differentiate our products and services and the quality and types of products and services we offer. Innovations in payment technology have enabled us to expand into new products and services, which have also expanded the potential scope of regulatory influence. Our compliance programs are designed to support our compliance with a wide array of regulations and laws, including those related to privacy and data protection, which are critical to our information management capability. The ability to provide data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access is essential for meeting changing business needs and directions. Our IT capabilities represent the application of technology, knowledge, practices, and management skills to further organizational goals. We face intense competition in our industry, where technology evolves rapidly, and new competitors or methods of payment emerge. Our products compete with various payment methods, and we must adapt to technological changes and the proliferation of alternative types of payment services. The competitive landscape is shifting, and we may be asked to adjust our local rules and practices or develop new payment services to remain competitive. Our relationships with financial institutions, acquirers, processors, merchants, and other third parties are complex and require us to balance the interests of multiple stakeholders. We depend significantly on these relationships to support our programs and services and compete effectively in the marketplace. Our ability to sustain and grow these relationships is crucial for our success. The global payments industry is undergoing significant technological change, including mobile and other proximity payment technologies, tokenization, and new authentication technologies. We expect new services and technologies to continue to emerge and evolve, and our ability to keep pace with these changes is critical for our future growth. A disruption, failure, or breach of our networks or systems, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could harm our business and impact future growth. Our cybersecurity and processing systems may experience errors or interruptions from various causes, which could significantly disrupt our operations and damage our reputation. We continually enhance our compliance programs as regulations evolve, but we cannot guarantee that our practices will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities. The risks created by new laws or regulations in one jurisdiction may negatively affect our business in another jurisdiction or in other product offerings. Our financial results are dependent on our client and merchant base, which may be costly to win, retain, and maintain. We may need to adjust our pricing or offer incentives to our clients to increase payments volume and adapt to regulatory changes. Our ongoing investments in technology, infrastructure, and growth initiatives are essential to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives, ensuring that we remain competitive in a rapidly evolving market.

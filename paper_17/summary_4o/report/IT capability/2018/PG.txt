The company relies extensively on IT/OT systems, networks, and services, including internet and intranet sites, data hosting and processing facilities, and technologies to assist in conducting business. These systems are utilized for ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, shipping products to customers, marketing and selling products to consumers, and collecting, transferring, storing, and processing customer and stakeholder information. The company maintains an IT/OT risk management program supervised by information technology management, which includes analyses of emerging cybersecurity threats and strategies to address them. Despite policies and programs, the company may not effectively identify and mitigate every risk, and reliance on IT/OT systems exposes the company to various cybersecurity threats, including advanced persistent threats and unauthorized access attempts. The company has seen no material impact from these attacks to date but cannot guarantee future security efforts will prevent material breaches. Upgrading IT/OT systems or adopting new technologies could expose the company to increased cybersecurity breaches and operational issues if not properly managed. The company has undertaken a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in various areas, including supply chain and marketing, which are critical for achieving business objectives. The ability to meet growth targets depends on successful product, marketing, and operations innovation, which relies on technology advancements that lead to product improvements and enhanced marketing programs. The company’s strategic focus includes delivering superior value to consumers through innovation, which requires consumer insights and technology advancements. The company’s financial condition is supported by its ability to generate substantial cash from operations and access capital markets at competitive rates, which is essential for funding operating needs and capital expenditures. The company’s organizational structure includes global business units responsible for developing brand strategy, new product innovations, and marketing plans, emphasizing the importance of IT capabilities in supporting these functions. The company’s ongoing productivity improvements and cost-saving initiatives are designed to enhance operational effectiveness and organizational culture, which are vital for sustaining competitive advantage in a dynamic market environment. The company faces numerous risks, including those related to political volatility, economic uncertainty, and changes in government policies, which could adversely impact its business operations and financial performance. The company’s reliance on third-party relationships for various functions creates additional risks, necessitating effective management of these relationships to mitigate potential impacts on financial results. The company's ability to manage compliance with laws and regulations is critical, as failure to do so could negatively affect its reputation and business outcomes. Overall, the integration of IT capabilities into the company’s operations is essential for enhancing efficiency, supporting innovation, and maintaining competitive positioning in the market.

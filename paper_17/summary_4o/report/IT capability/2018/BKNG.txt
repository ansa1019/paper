The markets for the services we offer are intensely competitive, constantly evolving, and subject to rapid change, with current and new competitors able to launch new services at relatively low cost. Some of our current and potential competitors, such as Google, Apple, Alibaba, Tencent, Amazon, and Facebook, have significantly more customers or users, consumer data, and financial and other resources than we do, enabling them to leverage other aspects of their businesses to compete more effectively. Our strategy involves continued expansion throughout the world, and we are subject to associated risks typical of international businesses, including compliance with legal, regulatory, or tax requirements in multiple jurisdictions. We believe that providing an extensive collection of properties, excellent customer service, and an intuitive, easy-to-use consumer experience are important factors influencing a consumer's decision to make a reservation. As a result, it is increasingly important to offer travel services at competitive prices, whether through discounts, coupons, or loyalty programs. We rely on performance marketing channels to generate a significant amount of traffic to our websites, and our performance marketing efficiency is impacted by various factors including ad rates, cancellation rates, and our ability to convert paid traffic to booking customers. Our business is driven primarily by international results, which consist of the results of our international brands, and we expect our operating results and other financial metrics to continue to be largely driven by international performance. We have invested considerable resources in the establishment and maintenance of our brands, and we will continue to invest resources in brand marketing and other brand-building efforts to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of our brands. Our online performance marketing efficiency is impacted by numerous factors that are subject to variability, including competition for desired rankings in search results and changes in how search engines present travel search results. We have experienced a significant shift of both direct and indirect business to mobile platforms, and our advertising partners are also seeing a rapid shift of traffic to mobile platforms. As consumers increasingly turn to mobile devices, we become dependent on maintaining connectivity and the ability to effectively offer our services on mobile devices through mobile apps and mobile-optimized websites. Our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies and to continually innovate and improve the performance, features, and reliability of our services and online platforms in response to competitive service offerings and the evolving demands of the marketplace. We also rely on third-party distribution channels to distribute accommodation, rental car, and airline ticket reservations, and any deterioration in these channels could negatively affect our business. Our international businesses include various accommodation reservation services, and we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from these services. We are committed to investing in technology and personnel to support our business initiatives, including expanding our technology infrastructure and enhancing our information technology capabilities to improve operational efficiency and customer experience.

Our ability to respond to and keep up with the rapid pace of technological and market changes is critical for maintaining competitiveness. We rely on sophisticated software applications and computing infrastructure for the operation of our business, and any failures in these IT systems could adversely affect our results of operations. The implementation of new information technology, payment, enterprise resource planning, or other systems is disruptive and costly and may not be successful, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We are conducting a multi-year phased migration to integrate and upgrade certain systems and processes, and any failure to implement or adapt to new technologies in a timely manner could adversely affect our ability to compete. Our marketing efficiency is impacted by various factors, including our ability to convert paid traffic to booking customers and the timing and effectiveness of our brand marketing campaigns, which are closely tied to our IT capabilities. We face risks related to data privacy obligations and cybersecurity, as our processing, storage, use, and disclosure of personal data expose us to risks of data breaches. Cyberattacks are increasing in frequency and sophistication, and we may not be able to defend against these threats effectively. Our IT governance practices must keep pace with continuous innovation, and vulnerabilities in our consumer and partner account security could result in unauthorized access to personal and confidential data. We are also dependent on third-party service providers and their systems, and any damage to or interruption in these services could prevent us from booking related reservations and have a material adverse effect on our business. Our investments in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business and present risks, including the integration of acquired businesses, which requires significant time and resources. We are subject to various competition and consumer protection laws and regulations that could impact our IT operations, particularly as we expand our business into new areas. The digital markets act and digital services act impose new rules and requirements on platforms designated as "gatekeepers," which could increase compliance costs and require changes to our products or business practices. We are also focused on enhancing our payments capabilities, including offering alternative payment solutions to consumers, which necessitates robust IT infrastructure and compliance with evolving regulations. Our marketing expenses are significantly variable and are impacted by our IT capabilities, as we rely on marketing channels to generate traffic to our websites. The competitive landscape necessitates that we continually innovate and enhance our IT capabilities to provide a best-in-class user experience. Our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, particularly in technology roles, is critical for maintaining our IT capabilities and overall business performance. We face challenges in retaining key employees and hiring well-qualified personnel, which could adversely affect our business and competitive position. The reliance on mobile devices and the shift in consumer behavior toward mobile platforms further emphasizes the need for a robust IT infrastructure to support our operations and enhance customer engagement. Overall, our IT capabilities are integral to our strategic objectives, operational efficiency, and ability to respond to market dynamics.

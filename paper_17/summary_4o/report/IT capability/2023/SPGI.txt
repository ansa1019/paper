The company’s operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential, sensitive, and other types of data and information in its information systems and networks. Cybersecurity, technology, and innovation risks are heightened due to the size, scale, and role of the company in global markets, increasing exposure to cyber attacks and other cybersecurity risks. The company devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly update its systems and processes designed to protect the security of its information systems, software, networks, and technology assets. However, these measures may be circumvented or become obsolete, and additional measures may be expensive or ineffective. The rapid change of technology is a key feature of all markets in which the company operates, necessitating the deployment of improved processes and technology to innovate, design, develop, assemble, test, market, and support new products and enhancements in a timely and cost-effective manner. The company is transitioning its technology to a cloud-based infrastructure, which is complex and time-consuming, involving substantial expenditures and inherent risks, including potential disruptions to normal operations. Enhancing existing products and developing new products require effective collaboration across various divisions, functions, and business lines, as ineffective collaboration may decrease the ability to expand geographically and innovate. The company faces challenges in maintaining competitive positioning due to the increasing availability of free or inexpensive information sources, which may reduce demand for its products. The company has established a company-wide AI strategy to drive its approach to data protection, licensing, and AI integration in its processes, products, and services, making significant investments in various AI initiatives. However, the rapidly evolving AI landscape presents complexities, including new laws and regulations, competition, and ethical concerns that could adversely impact the company’s ability to protect its data and intellectual property. The company’s reliance on network systems and the internet means that any failures or disruptions may adversely affect its ability to serve customers. The company’s ability to deliver products and services electronically may be impaired due to various factors, including infrastructure failures, malicious software, human error, and natural disasters. The company’s operations and infrastructure may malfunction or fail, which could have a material adverse effect on its business. The company’s strategy includes strengthening data management capabilities for cross-enterprise value creation and adopting efficient modern native cloud technologies and data services. The company’s investment choices in information technology data centers and other technology initiatives are critical, as it cannot provide assurances that such investments will result in increased revenues. The company’s competitive landscape is characterized by intense competition, requiring continuous innovation and adaptation to maintain market share. The company’s focus on enhancing customer support and seamless user experience is essential for retaining and attracting customers in a rapidly changing environment.

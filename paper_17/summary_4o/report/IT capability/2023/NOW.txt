Investing in our securities involves risks, including our ability to grow our business, which may be restricted by laws, regulations, and customer expectations regarding the use, storage, and movement of data. We participate in intensely competitive markets, and if we do not compete effectively, our business and operating results will be harmed. If we fail to innovate in response to rapidly evolving technological and market developments and customer needs, our competitive position and business prospects may be harmed. Our reliance on a network of partners for an increasing portion of our revenues means that if these partners fail to perform, our ability to sell and distribute our products may be impacted. Actual or perceived cybersecurity events may create the perception that our platform is not secure, potentially resulting in lost customers or significant liabilities. Delays in improving our information systems and processes could interfere with our ability to support our existing and growing customer and employee base. We must successfully continue to release new products and updates to existing products, as delays or defects may slow the adoption of our latest technologies, reduce our ability to efficiently provide services, and decrease customer satisfaction. Our business depends on our platform being available without disruption, and disruptions or defects could damage our customers' businesses and harm our reputation. We have made and will continue to make substantial investments in data centers, geographic-specific service delivery models, and cloud computing infrastructure to support our growth. The pace of innovation will continue to accelerate as customers recognize the advantages of acquiring leading digital technologies and adopting modern cloud-based infrastructure. To compete effectively, we must identify and innovate in the right technologies, keep pace with rapidly changing technological developments, and accurately predict our customers' changing digital transformation needs. Our ability to manage these risks is crucial for our operational flexibility and overall business performance. We expect our revenue growth rate to decline over the long term due to increasing competition, and we continue to invest in our strategic priorities, which may not result in increased revenues. Our subscription revenues are primarily derived from fees that give customers access to our ordered subscription service, and we recognize revenues ratably over the subscription term. We have experienced a renewal rate of 98% for the past three years, indicating strong customer retention. Our success depends significantly on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, particularly in technology roles critical to our growth. We also face challenges related to compliance with complex regulations and contracting provisions in various jurisdictions, which can consume significant management resources and impact our ability to win business. As we continue to expand our business internationally, we will inevitably do more business with large private enterprises and the public sector in countries outside of the U.S., which subjects us to increased scrutiny and potential liability. Our intellectual property protections may not provide us with a competitive advantage, and defending our intellectual property may result in substantial expenses that harm our operating results. The incorporation of open-source software into our products may expose us to additional risks and obligations. Overall, our ability to leverage IT capabilities effectively in support of our business strategies and operational processes is essential for maintaining competitive advantage and achieving long-term growth.

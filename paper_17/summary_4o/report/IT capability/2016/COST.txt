Our investment in modernizing our information systems is ongoing and expected to continue to negatively impact selling, general and administrative expenses. Higher central operating costs, predominantly due to costs associated with our information systems modernization, including increased depreciation for projects placed in service, incurred by our U.S. operations, have contributed to the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales. The negative impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales has also influenced our operational efficiency and overall financial performance. We believe that our ability to control costs is heavily reliant on our information management capability, which includes providing data and information to users with appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access, tailored to changing business needs and directions. Our operational model is generally the same across our U.S., Canada, and other international operating segments, and our financial performance depends on our ability to adapt to changes in competition and economic conditions. The modernization of our information systems is part of our strategy to enhance our operational flexibility and improve our capability to respond to market dynamics. As we continue to expand our warehouse operations and online business, we recognize the importance of leveraging technology resources to support our business strategies and work processes. The integration of our information systems is expected to facilitate better data management and improve our decision-making speed, ultimately contributing to our competitive advantage. Our ongoing investments in technology infrastructure are aimed at enhancing our organizational capabilities, ensuring that we can effectively mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with other strategic resources. The impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar has been a significant factor affecting our financial results, and we have historically adapted our business model to mitigate these external influences. Our focus on maintaining a perception of "pricing authority" among our members is supported by our ability to provide quality goods and services at competitive prices, which is further enhanced by our information technology capabilities. We believe that our IT capabilities, which encompass the coordination of our assets and internal processes, are crucial in transforming our firm into a competitive force within the market. The ability to effectively support business needs through IT resources is essential for achieving our organizational goals and enhancing overall firm performance.

The efficient operation of our business processes and information systems is critical to our business, and modifications or interruptions of such systems may disrupt our business, processes, and internal controls. Our information technology systems must be sufficiently scalable to support business growth and may require modifications or upgrades that expose us to operational risks. We continuously work on simplifying our information systems and applications through consolidation and standardization efforts. Our information technology environment is evolving, embracing new methods of communication and data sharing that promote business efficiency, but these practices can also result in a more distributed IT environment, complicating visibility and control over internal and external users. If our security controls cannot keep pace with these changes, or if we fail to meet regulatory and compliance requirements, our business could be materially adversely affected. Data breaches and cyber-attacks could compromise our intellectual property or sensitive information, resulting in significant costs and reputational harm. We maintain sensitive data on our networks, including intellectual property and proprietary business information, which must be securely maintained. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our business and reputation, and we face increasing threats from cyber-attacks that are becoming more sophisticated and harder to detect. Our reliance on third-party providers for certain IT services introduces additional risks, as we cannot guarantee that these providers will fulfill their responsibilities in a timely manner. We also depend on third-party companies for the design, manufacture, and supply of components that support our microprocessor and GPU offerings. If these third parties reduce their support or fail to deliver, our ability to sell our products could be materially adversely affected. The success of our business is dependent upon our ability to introduce products on a timely basis with features and performance levels that provide value to our customers while supporting significant industry transitions. Our ability to develop, qualify, and distribute new products and related technologies to meet evolving industry requirements is a significant factor in determining our competitiveness. We also rely on third-party intellectual property for the design and development of new products, and if this intellectual property becomes unavailable or fails to meet our needs, our business could be materially adversely affected. Our investments in new products and technologies involve risks and uncertainties that could disrupt our ongoing business and may not generate sufficient revenue. The introduction of new products and enhancements is necessary to maintain our competitive position, and if we fail to predict consumer preferences or adjust our business accordingly, we may lose market share. Our IT capabilities have evolved to encompass the coordination of our assets and internal processes, and our ability to mobilize and deploy IT-based resources in combination with leveraging the value of other resources is essential for transforming our firm into a competitive force. The integration of our IT systems with business processes is vital for operational efficiency and organizational effectiveness, and any disruption in these systems could materially affect our business performance.

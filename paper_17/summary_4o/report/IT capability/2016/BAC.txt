In the course of conducting our business operations, we are exposed to a variety of risks, including those related to the evolving landscape of information technology capabilities, which have become integral in coordinating a firmâ€™s assets and internal processes. Our operational and security systems, including our computer systems and data management, are essential to our performance and are continuously updated to support our operations and growth. We rely on our employees and third parties in our day-to-day operations, which exposes us to operational risks that could disrupt our businesses. The potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout our organization, and we have implemented backup systems and safeguards to support our operations. However, significant disruptions to our systems or those of third parties could adversely affect our ability to process transactions or provide services. Cybersecurity risks have significantly increased, necessitating the enhancement of our controls and processes to protect our systems and data from attacks. Our businesses are highly dependent on the security and efficacy of our infrastructure, and we continuously monitor and improve our cybersecurity measures. The management of technology resources is critical for maintaining operational efficiency and supporting business needs. We have established a comprehensive risk management framework that integrates technology management within our strategic planning processes. This framework includes a defined risk appetite statement approved by the board, which guides our decision-making regarding technology investments and resource allocation. In addition, our risk management practices encompass the identification, measurement, monitoring, and control of key risks, including those associated with technology deployment and IT governance. We utilize various models and strategies to assess and control our market risk exposures, which are subject to inherent limitations. Our ability to manage data effectively is crucial for producing accurate financial, regulatory, and operational reporting. The accuracy of our information systems capability is vital for supporting our operational flexibility and strategic resource allocation. We continuously evaluate our technology capabilities to ensure alignment with our organizational goals and market dynamics. Our investment in digital technologies and infrastructure is aimed at enhancing our competitive advantage and improving our market responsiveness. The evolving regulatory context also influences our technology management practices, as compliance with applicable laws and regulations is essential for mitigating operational and reputational risks. Our strategic decisions regarding technology integration and resource management are driven by the need to adapt to changing business environments and consumer demands. The effectiveness of our IT systems plays a significant role in our overall firm performance and operational efficiency, allowing us to respond to market changes and maintain strong customer relationships.

Our business and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties, including adverse changes in market conditions for travel services, competition, and our ability to successfully manage growth and expand globally. The adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business has highlighted the importance of operational flexibility and adaptability in response to unexpected situations. We have experienced volatility in transaction growth rates and increased cancellation rates during periods of economic and political uncertainty, which underscores the need for effective risk management and resilience strategies. The uncertainty of macroeconomic factors complicates our ability to forecast industry and consumer trends, which could adversely affect our operational continuity and performance. Events beyond our control, such as terrorist attacks and extreme weather, may disrupt travel and limit consumer willingness to travel, impacting our business and results of operations. Our competitive landscape is characterized by intense competition, requiring us to adapt to changes in consumer purchasing behavior and market dynamics. The ongoing evolution of technology and consumer preferences necessitates continuous innovation and the ability to reconfigure our services to meet customer needs effectively. We rely on a diverse range of travel service providers, and any significant reduction in their participation could materially affect our market share and operational capabilities. The COVID-19 pandemic has also prompted a shift towards domestic travel and alternative accommodations, requiring us to reassess our strategic initiatives and resource allocation. Our long-term strategy involves expanding our global presence while managing the associated risks typical of international businesses. We are committed to enhancing our service offerings, which may involve significant investments that could impact our profit margins in the short term. As we pursue our connected trip vision, we recognize the complexity of integrating and upgrading our systems to support growth and improve customer experience. Our reliance on marketing channels to generate traffic to our platforms is critical, and we must navigate the challenges posed by changes in online search algorithms and competitive pressures. The performance of our highly skilled employees is essential for our success, and we face intense competition for talent, which could adversely affect our organizational effectiveness. Our ability to maintain consumer trust and confidence in our services is paramount, particularly in light of increasing cybersecurity threats and data privacy regulations. We are also subject to evolving legal and regulatory frameworks that could impose additional compliance costs and operational constraints. The successful execution of our strategic objectives will depend on our ability to anticipate and manage these risks while fostering a culture of resilience and adaptability within our organization.

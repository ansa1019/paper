Our operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition, including risks related to our global operations, which expose us to social, political, and economic challenges. We face difficulties and costs in managing international operations, which may include compliance with differing employment practices and labor issues, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, and political instability. Disruptions in the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, impacting our ability to make principal and interest payments or refinance outstanding debt. The depreciation in the value of foreign currencies where we have significant investments may also adversely affect our financial position. We are subject to foreign currency risk and attempt to mitigate this risk through hedging strategies, although there can be no assurance of their effectiveness. Our investments are concentrated in the logistics sector, which may expose us to economic downturns in that sector. We seek to minimize risks through geographic diversification and market research, but these risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Our operating performance is impacted by economic conditions in the local, regional, national, and international markets where we own properties. A downturn in any of these markets could adversely affect our business. We also face risks associated with our customers' ability to meet lease obligations, which could result in delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlords. The ability to lease properties at favorable rates is crucial, and competition may pressure us to reduce rental rates. Our real estate development and redevelopment strategies may not be successful, and we may not be able to obtain financing for development projects on favorable terms. We are exposed to various environmental risks that could result in unanticipated losses affecting our business. Our insurance coverage does not cover all potential losses, and certain losses may not be fully insured. We are also exposed to potential physical risks from climate change, which may require us to implement new regulations. Our ability to generate cash from operating activities and access to external sources of capital is essential for meeting our anticipated future development and operational needs. We expect to be cautious in evaluating capital deployment activities due to the uncertain macro environment and its impact on real estate valuations. Our liquidity and capital resources are influenced by our ability to generate cash flow from property operations, fees earned from co-investment ventures, and proceeds from property contributions and dispositions. We maintain sufficient influence over our co-investment ventures to achieve our business objectives, although there can be no assurance of continued success. Our organizational resilience is reflected in our capacity to adapt to changing market conditions, manage risks effectively, and maintain operational continuity amidst external pressures and disruptions.

This report contains statements that are not historical facts and are considered "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations. Significant shortages, price increases, or unavailability of third-party services could increase our operating costs, require significant capital expenditures, or adversely impact the competitive position of our products. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, inflationary increases in manufacturing costs and operating expenses, as well as negative impacts from weakening exchange rates against the United States dollar, which could have a material adverse impact on our profitability and results of operations. The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine may adversely affect our business and results of operations, leading to increased inflation rates and supply chain challenges. We are subject to risks associated with our extensive global operations, including changes in reimbursement, regulatory requirements, and political and economic instability, which could adversely impact our ability to manage these risks in an increasingly volatile environment. The COVID-19 pandemic has materially adversely affected our operations, supply chain, manufacturing, product distribution, and other business activities, leading to delays and shortages in the supply of components or materials. We have experienced a significant and unpredictable need to adjust our operations as market demand for certain of our products has shifted, particularly due to the suspension of elective medical procedures. Our ability to maintain close working relationships with respected physicians and medical personnel is crucial for product research and development, and any inability to do so could adversely affect our ability to develop, market, and sell new and improved products. We rely on indirect distribution channels to market, distribute, and sell our products, and our ability to continue to market and sell our products may be at risk if these channels become insolvent or choose to sell competitive products. We are in the process of implementing a new commercial global ERP system, and any disruptions or deficiencies in this implementation could adversely affect our ability to operate our business. Our sales, technical, and other key personnel play an integral role in our business, and if we are unable to recruit and retain a talented workforce, we may not meet our strategic business objectives. We have observed an overall tightening and increasingly competitive labor market due to labor shortages caused in part by the COVID-19 pandemic. The physical effects of climate change could adversely affect our operations and operating results, as increased frequency and severity of adverse weather conditions may cause significant business interruptions. We are subject to extensive governmental regulation, and failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in sanctions that could adversely affect our operations. Our insurance program may not be adequate to cover future losses, and the ultimate cost to resolve product liability claims could materially affect our financial position. We are involved in various ongoing legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, and the outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time.

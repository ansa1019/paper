Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those related to the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, which could harm our business and results of operations. We have taken measures intended to mitigate the spread of the virus and minimize the risk to our employees, channel partners, end-customers, and the communities in which we operate. The pandemic has caused significant disruptions and may continue to affect our workforce and operations, leading to challenges in meeting customer needs and managing supply chain complexities. Our business and operations have experienced growth, and if we do not effectively manage future growth or improve our systems, processes, and controls, our operating results could be adversely affected. We must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, as well as our operational and administrative systems, to manage headcount, capital, and processes efficiently. The variability of our operating results may cause fluctuations in our financial performance, which could adversely impact our business. Our ability to navigate these challenges effectively is critical to maintaining operational flexibility and ensuring business continuity. 

We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and geopolitical conditions, which could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results. Our reliance on channel partners to sell our products and subscriptions means that if these partners fail to perform, our ability to distribute our offerings will be limited. The competitive landscape is intense, and we may lack sufficient resources to maintain or improve our competitive position. Our ability to sell our products and subscriptions is dependent on the quality of our technical support services, and any failure to provide high-quality support could adversely affect customer satisfaction and our sales. 

The ongoing impact of COVID-19 has caused increased economic uncertainty, which may lead to changes in spending patterns among our end-customers. We have seen supply chain challenges increase, including chip and component shortages, which have delayed product deliveries and increased costs. Our ability to forecast operating results has been complicated by these disruptions. We continue to invest in innovation to enhance our portfolio, which is essential for meeting the needs of our end-customers and improving our competitive position. 

As we grow, we face the challenge of maintaining our corporate culture, which fosters innovation and teamwork. The loss of key employees or ineffective management of leadership transitions could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our strategic objectives. We must also manage the complexities of our supply chain effectively to avoid disruptions that could adversely affect our business performance. Our future performance depends on our ability to adapt to changing market conditions, manage operational resources efficiently, and maintain a focus on customer needs while navigating the uncertainties presented by external pressures.

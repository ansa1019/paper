Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins. The ability to remain competitive depends on success in making innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and consumers. We face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms, and the competitive pressures may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and increased operating costs, leading to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income. Our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building best-in-class platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with artificial intelligence. We embrace cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation, which is essential for maintaining operational flexibility and adapting to changing market conditions. Our success in the Internet of Things will depend on the level of adoption of our offerings, and we must continue to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers while ensuring our cloud-based services meet reliability expectations. We are committed to developing and deploying defensive measures to defend against security threats to our internal IT systems, cloud-based services, and customers' systems, which is critical for maintaining system integrity and operational continuity. Cybersecurity threats are constantly evolving, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them, which could disrupt our ability to provide services to our customers and protect their data. Our increasing focus on cloud-based services presents execution and competitive risks, and we must ensure our strategies will attract users or generate the revenue required to succeed. The development and deployment of new technologies are complex and can require long periods, and significant delays or problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue. We expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy, which involves significant challenges and risks. The success of these transactions will depend on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones. We strive to empower all people and organizations to achieve more, and accessibility of our products is an important aspect of this goal. The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the IT industry are unclear, and environmental regulations may affect the availability or cost of goods and services necessary to run our business. Our global operations expose us to operational and economic risks, and geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions that impact our ability to do business in some markets. We must continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and technology while ensuring effective succession planning to maintain organizational resilience.

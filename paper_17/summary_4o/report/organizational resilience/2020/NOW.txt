Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created significant global economic uncertainty, adversely impacting the business of our customers, partners, and vendors. The pandemic disrupted the flow of the economy and put unprecedented strains on businesses and individuals around the world. We experienced curtailed customer demand, reduced customer spend or contract duration, and delayed collections, which could materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations, and overall financial performance in future periods. In response to the pandemic, we focused on maintaining business continuity, helping our employees, customers, and communities, and preparing for the future and the long-term success of our business. We temporarily closed most of our offices, encouraged our employees to work remotely, and implemented travel restrictions, which may pose operational and workplace culture challenges. We expect that the pandemic will have a long-term effect on the nature of our office environment and how we innovate, potentially leading to operational flexibility challenges and talent retention issues. The extent and continued impact of the pandemic on our business will depend on various uncertain developments, including government responses and the effectiveness of those actions. 

We operate in intensely competitive markets, and if we do not compete effectively, our business and operating results will be harmed. The markets for our enterprise cloud solutions are rapidly evolving and highly competitive, with relatively low barriers to entry. Our ability to adapt to rapidly evolving technological, market, and customer developments is critical for maintaining our competitive position. We must identify and innovate in the right emerging technologies and accurately predict our customers' changing business needs, priorities, and adoption practices. 

Our operations involve the storage, transmission, and processing of our customers' confidential data, and while we have security measures in place, cyber-security threats continue to evolve, necessitating significant investments to protect data and infrastructure. A security breach could result in disruptions to our service, litigation, regulatory investigations, and reputational damage. 

Natural disasters and other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, potentially impacting our ability to deliver services and increasing operational expenses. We maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, but such events could make it difficult to sustain operations. Our business operations are subject to interruption by various external pressures, including pandemics, geopolitical instability, and environmental disruptions. 

We rely on our network of partners for an increasing portion of our revenues, and if these partners fail to perform, our ability to sell and distribute our products may be limited. Additionally, we face risks related to compliance with various laws and regulations, particularly as we expand internationally. Our ability to manage these risks and maintain operational continuity is essential for our organizational resilience and long-term success.

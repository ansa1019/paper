The business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects of nee and fpl are subject to a variety of risks, many of which are beyond their control. These risks may materially adversely affect their business and could cause actual results to differ substantially from expectations. In their business planning and management of operations, nee and fpl must address the effects of regulation, and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on their business. The operations of nee and fpl are subject to extensive regulation, which may limit or adversely impact their earnings. Regulatory decisions may require fpl to cancel or delay planned development activities or incur costs that may not be recoverable through rates. The inability to recover costs in a timely manner could materially adversely affect their financial condition. The local and national political, regulatory, and economic environment may have an adverse effect on regulatory decisions, impacting fpl's earnings. The regulatory process does not provide assurance of achieving authorized earnings levels. The business could be negatively affected by federal or state laws mandating new limits on greenhouse gas emissions, which could create substantial additional costs and require significant capital investment. The extensive federal regulation of operations exposes nee and fpl to significant compliance costs and potential penalties for compliance failures. The operations are also subject to various environmental laws and regulations that may result in increased operating costs and liabilities. The potential effects of greenhouse gas emission limits are subject to significant uncertainties. The business could suffer if nee and fpl do not proceed with projects under development or are unable to complete construction on schedule or within budget. Operational risks could result in lost revenues due to prolonged outages or increased expenses due to compliance failures. Severe weather and natural disasters could disrupt operations and lead to significant costs for restoration and repair. The ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions is critical for maintaining operational continuity. Threats of terrorism and cyberattacks could materially adversely affect their business, limiting their ability to generate or transmit power. The ability to obtain insurance and the terms of coverage could be adversely affected by various events, and the lack of adequate insurance could have a material adverse effect on their financial condition. The ability to access capital and credit markets is essential for funding operations and growth, and disruptions in these markets could negatively affect their liquidity and financial condition. The companies are closely monitoring the global outbreak of COVID-19 and taking steps to mitigate potential risks. The ultimate impact of public health crises on their business cannot be predicted, but they are prepared to adapt to changing conditions. The financial results may vary significantly due to factors such as commodity price volatility, credit risk, and operational challenges. The management of these risks is integral to maintaining organizational resilience and ensuring the ability to respond to unexpected situations effectively.

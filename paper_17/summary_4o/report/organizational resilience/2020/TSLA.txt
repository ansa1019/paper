The risks described could materially affect our business, financial condition, and future results, particularly related to our ability to grow amidst macroeconomic conditions resulting from the global COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has caused a worldwide impact, leading to temporary suspensions of operations at our manufacturing facilities and challenges in supply chains, which have resulted in delays and increased costs. We continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business as appropriate. Sustaining our production trajectory requires the readiness and solvency of our suppliers and vendors, a stable production workforce, and ongoing government cooperation. If current global market conditions worsen or if we cannot maintain operations at a scope commensurate with such conditions, our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results may be harmed. We have previously experienced and may in the future experience delays in launching and ramping the production of our products due to unexpected supplier issues and challenges with ramping automation for manufacturing processes. Our future business depends on increasing the production of mass-market vehicles, which necessitates efficient and cost-effective manufacturing capabilities and processes. We must address bottlenecks and unexpected challenges promptly while continuing to improve manufacturing processes and reducing costs. Our success will depend on our ability to expand sales capabilities and accurately project demand in various markets. We face difficulties with deliveries at increasing volumes, particularly in international markets, and must ensure our servicing capabilities keep pace with our growing fleet. We are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, political uncertainty, and economic conditions in numerous jurisdictions, which may increase our costs and impact our ability to sell our products. Our business may suffer if our products contain defects or fail to perform as expected, which could result in delivery delays and significant warranty expenses. We must maintain public credibility and confidence in our long-term business prospects, which may be challenging due to our limited operating history and competition. Our future growth and success are dependent upon consumer demand for electric vehicles in a competitive and volatile automotive industry. We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and may face regulatory challenges that could limit our ability to sell vehicles directly. Our operations could be adversely affected by events outside of our control, such as natural disasters and health epidemics. We must manage ongoing obligations under agreements related to our Gigafactory New York and ensure compliance with various regulatory requirements. Our ability to attract, hire, and retain key employees is critical to our success, and we face competition for skilled personnel. We must also manage risks related to our information technology systems and the threat of cyber-attacks. We are subject to evolving laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs or unfavorable changes upon our operations or products.

The COVID-19 pandemic has substantially burdened healthcare systems worldwide, impacting discovery, research, development, manufacturing, and sales of medicines, which could adversely affect the company's ability to commercialize assets in its product pipeline. The pandemic has resulted in changes in buying patterns throughout the supply chain, impacting demand for products and negatively affecting consolidated operating results. The company temporarily halted in-person interactions with healthcare providers and increased virtual interactions, demonstrating operational flexibility in response to external pressures. While in-person interactions have resumed in many locations, the company may decide to halt such activity in the future, reflecting adaptability to changing conditions. The pandemic has intensified other risks inherent in the business, including risks related to drug pricing and access, workplace safety, and productivity.

The company has taken steps to ensure operational continuity and maintain a reliable supply of medicines while supporting communities and ensuring access to medicines. The conditions created by the pandemic could impact manufacturing operations, global supply chains, and distribution systems, which are critical for producing and distributing products. The company faces unique risks related to the development and uptake of potential treatments for COVID-19, including supply chain disruptions and higher manufacturing costs. The introduction of new products and business development activities are essential for maintaining a continuous flow of successful products to cover substantial research and development costs. The company’s long-term success depends on its ability to discover, acquire, develop, and commercialize innovative new medicines, which requires effective resource allocation and strategic initiatives. The reliance on third-party relationships and outsourcing arrangements poses risks that could adversely affect the business, emphasizing the importance of inter-organizational collaboration. The company must navigate intense competition from multinational pharmaceutical companies and generic manufacturers, which could materially affect revenues.

We face significant risks related to the spread of the COVID-19 virus, which has had, and will continue to have, significant effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. The pandemic has subjected our business, operations, financial performance, cash flows, and financial condition to a number of risks, including increased operational challenges from the need to protect employee health and safety. These challenges have included production site shutdowns and workplace disruptions. We cannot predict whether further production disruptions could be required or what the ongoing impact of COVID-19-related operating restrictions will be. We continue to monitor health authorities for new guidance and may be required to impose additional operational restrictions. Any prolonged suspension of operations or delayed recovery would result in further challenges to our business, leading to a material adverse effect on our financial condition. The COVID-19 pandemic has also had a significant impact on our liquidity and overall debt levels. We expect negative operating cash flows in future quarters until deliveries return to historical levels, and if the pace and scope of recovery are worse than anticipated, we may need to obtain additional financing. Factors that could limit our access to additional liquidity include further disruptions in global capital markets and declines in our financial performance. The magnitude and duration of the pandemic's impact are uncertain and continue to adversely affect our business and operating results. We are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties related to the 737 MAX, including uncertainties regarding regulatory approvals and potential outcomes of legal proceedings. The grounding has reduced revenues, operating margins, and cash flows, and will continue to do so until production rates return to pre-grounding levels. We developed software updates for the 737 MAX and continue to work with civil aviation authorities to complete remaining steps toward certification. Any delays in certification or ramp-up of deliveries could materially adversely affect our financial position. We must minimize disruption caused by production changes and achieve productivity improvements to meet customer demand and maintain profitability. The commercial aircraft market is predominantly driven by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic, influenced by airline profitability and economic growth. The industry has been cyclical and competitive, with significant profit swings and challenges to be more cost-competitive. Significant deterioration in the global economic environment or financial stability of major customers could result in fewer new orders or cause customers to postpone or cancel orders. We are focused on improving our products and services and continuing our business transformation efforts, which enhance our ability to compete and position us for market recovery. We are also taking actions to ensure that we are not harmed by unfair subsidization of competitors. The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant uncertainty around the timing of deliveries and production rates. We expect to incur abnormal production costs due to low production rates and must continue to reassess our operational strategies to adapt to these challenges. Our ability to deliver products and services that satisfy customer requirements is heavily dependent on the performance and financial stability of our subcontractors and suppliers. If one or more of our suppliers experiences performance problems, we may be unable to meet commitments to our customers or incur additional costs. The ongoing impacts of COVID-19 on market demand have created significant uncertainty around our operations and financial performance, necessitating a focus on operational flexibility and resilience strategies to navigate these challenges effectively.

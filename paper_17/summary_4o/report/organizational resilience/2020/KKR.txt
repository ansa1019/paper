Investing in our securities involves risk, and our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by difficult market and economic conditions, which can reduce the value or performance of the investments we manage or the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital. The global outbreak of COVID-19 caused severe economic contractions and continues to impact the United States and other countries, leading to disruptions in our business and financial results. Our businesses and the companies in which we invest are materially affected by financial markets and economic conditions or events throughout the world, such as interest rates, availability of credit, inflation rates, and economic uncertainty. We attempt to mitigate known risks, but we can provide no assurance that our mitigation efforts will be successful. Unfavorable market conditions may reduce opportunities for our funds to make, exit, and realize value from their investments, and challenging conditions may make it difficult to find suitable investments or secure financing on attractive terms. Our profitability may also be adversely affected by fixed costs and the possibility that we would be unable to scale back other costs within a time frame sufficient to match decreases in net income. During periods of difficult market or economic conditions, companies or assets in which we have invested may experience decreased revenues, financial losses, and increased funding costs. Negative financial results in our funds' portfolio companies may result in lower investment returns, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and cash flow. The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the potential adverse effects on our business, financial performance, and operating results, which may be material and affect us in unforeseen ways. We have implemented various initiatives intended to reduce the impact of COVID-19, such as employees working remotely from home, while also seeking to maintain business continuity. The scale and scope of the pandemic may exacerbate the potential adverse effects on our financial performance and operating results. We have contingency plans in place for key employees who may become sick or unable to perform their duties, but such plans cannot anticipate all scenarios. The ongoing nature of the outbreak makes it difficult to predict the magnitude of the ultimate impact on our business. Our liquidity requirements are significant and may be adversely affected by adverse market and economic conditions. We expect our primary liquidity needs to consist of cash required to support and grow our businesses, including funding capital commitments made to existing and future funds and servicing debt obligations. Our ability to raise additional or successor funds could be materially adversely impacted by poor performance by existing funds. The investment management business is intensely competitive, and we may face increased scrutiny and criticism regarding our business practices, which could harm our reputation and ability to attract and retain fund investors. The evolving preferences of our fund investors may necessitate that alternatives to the traditional investment fund structure become a larger part of our business. We may also face challenges in maintaining our organizational culture and operational flexibility, which could impair our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives. Our growth strategy includes expanding into new investment strategies and geographic markets, which may result in additional risks and uncertainties. We rely heavily on our financial, accounting, and other data processing systems, and any disruption in these systems could materially adversely affect our business. Cybersecurity failures and data security breaches may also disrupt our operations and have a material adverse impact on our businesses. The risks associated with our portfolio companies and the broader economic environment may affect our ability to achieve our major objectives and maintain organizational health.

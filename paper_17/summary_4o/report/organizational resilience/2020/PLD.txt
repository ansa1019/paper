Our operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition, including risks related to our global operations, which expose us to social, political, and economic factors. We conduct a significant portion of our business outside the U.S., and disruptions in international operations could negatively affect us, including difficulties in staffing and managing operations in different geographies, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, and political instability. Disruptions in the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, potentially impacting the value of our properties and our ability to make principal and interest payments. Our investments are concentrated in the logistics sector, and any economic downturn in that sector could adversely affect our business. We seek to minimize risks through geographic diversification and market research, but these risks cannot be eliminated. Our ability to recover investments in real estate assets may be impacted by current market conditions, and we may face challenges in leasing properties or renewing leases on favorable terms. We depend on the deep industry knowledge and efforts of our executive officers and other key employees, and the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business. Our business continuity, communication plans, and technology have allowed us to maintain operations during the COVID-19 pandemic, and we have not had any layoffs, extending financial assistance to employees in need. We have continued to assist our customers in navigating the new environment while ensuring safety measures are followed. Our organizational practices and strategic initiatives are designed to adapt to changing market conditions and customer needs, and we have implemented mechanisms for recovery and resilience in response to the pandemic. Our capital deployment activities have continued, and we expect the volume of these activities to accelerate. The high quality and location of our real estate portfolio, along with favorable market fundamentals in the logistics sector, have contributed to our resilience during challenging times. We have maintained operational flexibility, allowing us to respond effectively to environmental disruptions. Our ability to access capital markets and manage debt maturities is critical for sustaining our operations and achieving our strategic objectives. We are exposed to various environmental risks, including potential liabilities related to hazardous substances, which could affect our business and financial condition. Our insurance coverage may not cover all potential losses, and significant losses could adversely affect our capital and future revenues. We continuously evaluate our insurance coverage and risk management strategies to ensure we are prepared for potential hazards. Our organizational resilience is reflected in our strategic response to external pressures, emphasizing adaptability and the importance of maintaining operational continuity in the face of adversity.

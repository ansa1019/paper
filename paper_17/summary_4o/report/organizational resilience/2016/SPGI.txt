We operate in the capital, commodities, and commercial markets, which include various segments that face significant risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations is critical. We continuously review the latest information available and assess our ability to predict the outcomes of legal proceedings and their effects on our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, and competitive position. Legal proceedings impose additional expenses and require the attention of senior management, potentially reducing their ability to address other business issues. We have made strategic acquisitions to strengthen our business and grow our company, which presents significant challenges and risks, including the integration of acquired businesses and the retention of key personnel. The anticipated benefits from acquisitions may not be fully realized, and various factors could adversely affect these benefits. We regularly assess and improve our business continuity plans and key management succession to mitigate risks associated with operational challenges, including disasters or other business continuity problems. Our ability to continue operations during such events depends on the availability of personnel, office facilities, and the proper functioning of our computer and telecommunication systems. We are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity, which could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of material information, damaging our reputation and customer confidence. Our operations rely on secure processing, storage, and transmission of sensitive data, and breaches could lead to significant financial losses and regulatory actions. We depend on the knowledge, experience, and ability of our highly skilled employees, and our success in attracting and retaining talent is vital for achieving strategic goals. The consolidation of customers and staffing levels across our customer base could impact our available markets and revenue growth. Our businesses are subject to increasing regulation, which could increase costs and affect our ability to compete. We have implemented internal controls and compliance programs to mitigate risks associated with legal and regulatory matters. Our financial services industry is rapidly evolving, and we must continue to invest in new offerings and adapt to changing customer needs to maintain a competitive position. We believe we have appropriate policies and processes to ensure the stability of our information technology environment, but unanticipated system failures could significantly disrupt our business operations. Our ability to deliver products and services electronically may be impaired due to various factors, including infrastructure failures and service outages. We also face competition from traditional and non-traditional providers, which may impact our market share and revenue. Our strategic initiatives focus on growth and operational excellence, and we strive to deliver strong financial performance and long-term value to our shareholders. We are committed to enhancing leadership and accountability within our organization to foster resilience and adaptability in the face of challenges.

An investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties, and our actual results and future trends may differ materially from our past or projected future performance. Our commercial airplanes business depends heavily on commercial airlines and is subject to unique risks. Market conditions significantly impact demand for our commercial aircraft, which is influenced by airline profitability, availability of aircraft financing, and various external pressures. The commercial aircraft market is predominantly driven by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic, which are affected by sustained economic growth and political stability. Our ability to maintain a healthy production system, achieve planned production rate targets, and meet stringent performance and reliability standards is critical for operational continuity. We must minimize disruption caused by production changes and achieve productivity improvements to meet customer demand and maintain profitability. Operational challenges impacting the production system could result in delays or failure to meet customer demand for new aircraft, negatively affecting revenues and operating margins. The complexity of our commercial aircraft production system requires extensive coordination and integration with suppliers, skilled labor, and adherence to regulatory requirements. Our strategy focuses on leveraging core businesses to capture key next-generation programs while expanding our presence in adjacent and international markets, emphasizing growth and productivity. We continue to seek opportunities to reduce costs, including working with suppliers to optimize operations and manage inventory effectively. The introduction of new aircraft programs involves increased risks associated with meeting development, testing, production, and certification schedules. Our ability to deliver aircraft on time and satisfy performance requirements is subject to significant risks, including potential reach-forward losses if we cannot efficiently incorporate design changes. We are also subject to risks related to government contracts, which are impacted by budgetary constraints and changes in defense spending priorities. The uncertainty surrounding program-level appropriations and the potential for budget cuts could materially affect our operations and financial position. Our business may be impacted by disruptions, including threats to physical security, cyber-attacks, and public health crises, which could affect our internal operations or our ability to deliver products and services. We rely on subcontractors and suppliers for raw materials and components, and any disruptions in their operations could adversely affect our commitments to customers. Our operations expose us to environmental liabilities, and we must comply with various regulations related to environmental protection. We maintain insurance for certain risks, but coverage may not be sufficient to cover all claims or liabilities. Our pension and postretirement benefit obligations significantly impact our earnings and cash flows, and changes in market conditions could affect our future contributions. The complexity of our operations and the need for effective risk management strategies are essential for maintaining organizational resilience in the face of external pressures and uncertainties.

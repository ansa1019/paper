The company is subject to significant uninsured exposures arising from errors and omissions, breach of fiduciary duty and similar claims, which may divert personnel and management resources. Given the unpredictability of errors and omissions claims and the litigation that can flow from them, it is possible that an adverse outcome in a particular matter could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations, or financial condition. The company regularly assesses and takes steps to improve its existing business continuity plans and key management succession. If a business continuity event occurs, the company could lose client or company data or experience interruptions to its operations or delivery of services to clients, which could have a material adverse effect. The risk of business disruption is more pronounced in certain geographic areas where the company has concentrations of customers and employees or significant operations. The company's operations depend on its ability to protect its technology infrastructure against damage. An extended outage could result in the loss of clients and a decline in revenues. The company has a history of making acquisitions and investments, and the process of integrating the information systems of the businesses acquired is complex and exposes the company to additional risk. The company may not adequately identify weaknesses in the target's information systems, which could affect the value derived from the acquisition or make its own systems more vulnerable to a cyber-attack. The company relies on a large number of vendors and other third parties to perform key functions of its business operations, and any significant failures by them could cause harm to its reputation or expose it to liability. The geographic breadth of the company's activities subjects it to significant legal, economic, operational, market, compliance, and reputational risks. The company faces intense, sustained competition in each of its operating segments, and its ability to compete successfully depends on various factors, including the quality and expertise of its colleagues and its ability to respond to changes in client demand and industry conditions. The company is also subject to numerous claims, lawsuits, and proceedings, including claims for errors and omissions, which require significant management judgment to estimate potential losses. The company maintains defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans for its employees, and the determination of net periodic pension cost is based on several assumptions, including expected long-term rates of return on plan assets and discount rates. Changes in these assumptions can significantly impact the company's financial condition. The company’s significant non-U.S. operations expose it to exchange rate fluctuations and various risks that could impact its business. The company expects to continue its practice of repatriating foreign funds from its non-U.S. operating subsidiaries, which could result in higher effective tax rates in the future. The company regularly assesses its risk management strategies and operational flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions and external pressures. The company’s ability to maintain its integrity and performance while under internal or external variations and disturbances is critical to its organizational resilience.

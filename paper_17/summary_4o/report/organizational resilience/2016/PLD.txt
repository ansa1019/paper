Our operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition, including social, political, and economic risks of doing business in many countries, which require effective risk management and adaptability. We depend on the deep industry knowledge and the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees, highlighting the importance of internal knowledge and human capital in maintaining organizational resilience. Our business and operations could suffer in the event of system failures or cyber security attacks, emphasizing the need for robust emergency management and crisis response strategies. We may be impacted by the ability of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to dividend or otherwise transfer cash among our subsidiaries, which relates to our resource allocation and operational flexibility under external pressures. Disruptions in the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, indicating the necessity for strategic initiatives to mitigate risks associated with financial resources. Our investments are concentrated in the logistics sector, and we are exposed to general economic conditions and other events that affect the markets in which we own properties, necessitating a systemic perspective on organizational health and performance under pressure. The ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform ourselves to emerge stronger from challenging situations is critical for organizational survival. We evaluate our business operations based on net operating income, which helps us understand the core operations of our business and maintain performance despite external disturbances. Our organizational practices include maintaining control of well-positioned land for development, which supports our resilience strategies and future planning. We believe that the quality and scale of our global operating portfolio, combined with the expertise of our team, provide us with unique competitive advantages that enhance our organizational capabilities. Our ability to generate cash from operating activities, distributions from our co-investment ventures, and dispositions of properties is crucial for meeting our anticipated future development and acquisition needs, reflecting our strategic management and resource generation efforts. We also face risks associated with our dependence on key personnel, as the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business. Our organizational response to economic downturns and market volatility is supported by our strategic adaptation and operational management practices. We are committed to maintaining sufficient influence over our co-investment ventures to achieve our business objectives, which requires effective inter-organizational collaboration and stakeholder engagement. The presence of environmental risks, including climate change impacts, necessitates proactive measures to ensure our organizational resilience. Our insurance coverage does not include all potential losses, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain adequate coverage, which poses a risk to our operational continuity. Our strategic planning involves assessing the carrying values of our real estate assets and ensuring that we can respond to changes in market conditions, which is essential for sustaining our organizational effectiveness and adaptability.

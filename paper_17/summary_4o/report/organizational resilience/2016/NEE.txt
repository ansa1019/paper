The business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects of nee and fpl are subject to a variety of risks, many of which are beyond their control. These risks may materially adversely affect their ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions. The operations of nee and fpl are subject to complex and comprehensive federal, state, and other regulations that could impact their business continuity. In their business planning and management of operations, they must address the effects of regulation, and any inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on their organizational health. The business could be adversely affected if they are unable to recover costs in a timely manner, which could impede their operational flexibility. Regulatory decisions may be materially affected by political, regulatory, and economic factors, which could require fpl to cancel or delay planned development activities, thereby impacting their adaptability to external pressures. The regulatory process does not guarantee the achievement of authorized earnings levels, which can affect their competitive advantage. 

The ability to proceed with projects under development may be adversely affected by escalating costs, regulatory compliance, and the inability to obtain necessary licenses or permits. Any failure to complete construction projects on schedule or within budget could materially affect their performance. The business could suffer from operational risks associated with facility start-up operations, adverse weather conditions, and natural disasters. Severe weather events can disrupt operations and lead to a loss of revenue, thereby impacting their resilience strategies. The potential for significant volatility in market prices for fuel and electricity may restrict their ability to manage operational risks effectively. 

The reliance on sensitive and complex information technology systems exposes nee and fpl to risks that could materially affect their business continuity. Any failure or breach of these systems could compromise their ability to fulfill critical business functions. The companies are also exposed to credit and performance risks from customers and vendors, which could lead to financial losses if counterparties fail to fulfill contractual obligations. 

In addition, the companies face risks related to project financing, construction, and governmental approvals that may impede their operational activities. The ability to maintain and negotiate franchise agreements on acceptable terms is crucial for fpl, as these agreements represent a substantial portion of its revenues. Employee strikes or work stoppages could disrupt operations and lead to a loss of revenue, further affecting their organizational resilience. 

The ability to access capital and credit markets is vital for supporting their liquidity and capital needs. Disruptions or volatility in these markets could increase their cost of capital and adversely affect their ability to grow their business. The companies must also manage their exposure to changes in interest rates and commodity prices, which could impact their financial performance. The ongoing evaluation of their operational resources and strategic initiatives is essential for maintaining resilience in the face of environmental disruptions and market volatility.

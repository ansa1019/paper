In evaluating our business, we recognize that a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales of products to treat HIV and HCV, and any unexpected and adverse changes to market dynamics may adversely impact our product revenues. We note that fluctuations in purchasing patterns of our non-retail customers can result in variations in our product sales, revenues, and earnings. Our operations depend on compliance with complex FDA and international regulations, and failure to maintain compliance could delay or halt commercialization of our products, adversely affecting our results of operations. We face significant competition from global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, which may impact our ability to sustain or increase sales of our products. Additionally, our results of operations may be adversely affected by current and potential future healthcare legislative and regulatory actions, including efforts to control prescription drug prices. The successful commercialization of our products depends on the availability of governmental and third-party payer reimbursement, and pricing pressures may reduce profitability. Our research and development efforts are critical for maintaining our competitive advantage, and we continually review our R&D pipeline to allocate resources effectively. We face risks in our clinical trials, including the potential for unfavorable results, delays, and disruptions, which could adversely affect our prospects for future revenue growth. Our reliance on third-party manufacturers and corporate partners introduces operational risks that could impair our ability to deliver products on a timely basis. We also depend on relationships with third parties for sales and marketing performance, and failure to maintain these relationships could negatively impact our business. The complexity of our operations, including the need for effective inventory management and the management of external pressures, highlights the importance of organizational resilience in navigating challenges. Our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and to manage risks associated with product development and commercialization is crucial for sustaining operational continuity and achieving our strategic objectives. We anticipate that our future capital requirements will depend on various factors, including the progress and scope of our R&D efforts and the potential for acquiring additional manufacturing capabilities. Furthermore, we are subject to various legal actions that could require significant resources and management attention, potentially impacting our financial condition. Our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel is essential for our success, and competition for talent in the biopharmaceutical field is intense. We are also dependent on information technology systems, which may be vulnerable to cyberattacks and security breaches that could adversely affect our operations and reputation. The ongoing evaluation of our tax positions and compliance with evolving regulations further underscores the need for strategic foresight and adaptability in our business practices.

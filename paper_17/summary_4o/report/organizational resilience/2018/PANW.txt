Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those related to our ability to effectively manage future growth and improve our systems, processes, and controls. The growth and expansion of our business place significant strain on our management, operational, and financial resources. To manage future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes efficiently. We may not be able to successfully implement or scale improvements to our systems, processes, and controls in an efficient or timely manner, which could result in increased costs, disrupt existing end-customer relationships, or harm our business performance and operating results. Our operating results may vary significantly from period to period and be unpredictable, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. We also face risks related to attracting and retaining new end-customers or selling additional products and subscriptions to existing end-customers, as well as changes in end-customer requirements or market needs. Our ability to manage production and manufacturing-related costs, global customer service organization costs, and inventory costs is critical to maintaining operational flexibility. We are subject to fluctuations in global economic conditions, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Our future success depends on our ability to expand the deployment of our platform with existing end-customers, which may require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts. We may also experience difficulties in managing improvements to our systems or in connection with third-party software. Our ability to navigate challenges such as increased competition and changes in the competitive landscape is essential for sustaining growth and maintaining operational continuity. We rely on our channel partners to sell substantially all of our products, and if these partners fail to perform, our ability to sell and distribute our products will be limited. The enterprise security market is characterized by rapidly changing technologies and business plans, which require us to adapt our offerings to meet changing end-customer needs. Our investments in research and development are aimed at enhancing our product offerings and ensuring we can respond effectively to market demands. We are also exposed to risks associated with changes in economic and political conditions in countries where we operate, which could limit our future growth. Our corporate culture fosters innovation and teamwork, which are critical for maintaining organizational resilience as we grow. Any failure to preserve this culture could limit our ability to innovate and negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel. Our ability to successfully manage our international operations and the associated risks is vital for future growth. We must also ensure that our technical support services meet the needs of our end-customers to maintain satisfaction and drive additional sales. Our future performance is dependent on the continued contributions of our senior management to execute our business plan and identify new opportunities. The loss of key employees or ineffective management of leadership transitions could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our strategic objectives.

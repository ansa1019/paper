Regulators increasingly seek to regulate certain aspects of payments systems, which may have a material adverse impact on our overall business and results of operations. New regulations could relate to our clearing and settlement activities, including risk management policies and procedures, which may require us to adapt our operational practices to maintain compliance and ensure business continuity. Increased regulatory oversight may result in costly compliance burdens, impacting our profitability and limiting our ability to innovate or offer differentiated products and services. We are devoting substantial resources to defending our right to establish interchange rates in regulatory proceedings, litigation, and legislative activity, as the potential outcome could have a significant impact on our operational flexibility and resilience strategies. The complexity of our payment technology requires careful management to address security vulnerabilities, and operational difficulties could lead to a loss of business and reputational damage. Our ability to adapt to technological advancements and evolving industry standards is critical for maintaining competitive advantage and ensuring organizational resilience. We rely on our relationships with financial institution customers and other stakeholders to support our programs and services, and any loss of business from these relationships could materially impact our performance. The payments industry is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving customer needs, necessitating continual adaptation and innovation to remain competitive. Our business continuity program analyzes risks and develops effective response strategies to mitigate potential disruptions. Information security incidents or account data compromise events could disrupt our business, increase costs, and damage our reputation, highlighting the importance of robust risk management practices. We face disintermediation risks as parties may attempt to eliminate our position as an intermediary in the payment process, which could adversely affect our operational dynamics and market position. The ongoing focus of merchants on acceptance costs may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings, increasing our incentive program costs and impacting profitability. Our expansion into new businesses could result in unanticipated issues that may be difficult to manage, emphasizing the need for strategic foresight and effective change management processes. We are subject to various claims and legal proceedings that could materially affect our results of operations, necessitating a proactive approach to risk assessment and management. The global economic and political environment poses additional challenges, as adverse trends may lead to reduced spending and impact cross-border activity, further complicating our operational landscape. Our ability to maintain operational continuity and respond effectively to external pressures is essential for sustaining organizational health and performance under pressure.

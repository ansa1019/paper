The companyâ€™s ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is critical for maintaining operational continuity. We regularly assess and take steps to improve our existing business continuity plans and key management succession. A disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain key operating areas could materially interrupt our business operations and result in financial loss, regulatory actions, reputational harm, or legal liability. Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential data, and any material incidents could cause reputational harm, loss of customers, regulatory actions, or financial losses. We experience cyber attacks of varying degrees regularly, and while there has not been a material adverse effect to date, future incidents could significantly impact our operations. The geographic breadth of our activities subjects us to significant legal, economic, operational, market, compliance, and reputational risks, including civil unrest and competition with local agencies that may have greater familiarity and support from local governments. Our ability to continue to operate will depend on the availability of personnel, office facilities, and the proper functioning of our computer and telecommunications systems. We have outsourced certain functions to third-party service providers, which involves risks that may disrupt operations if these providers fail to perform to our standards. Our ability to deliver products and services electronically may be impaired due to infrastructure failures, malicious software, or service outages, which could harm our reputation and result in loss of customers. The rapid change of technology is a key feature of our markets, and we must deploy improved processes and technology to innovate and support new products. We strive for operational excellence, continuous innovation, and a high-performance culture driven by our best-in-class talent. Our strategy includes investing for mid- to long-term revenue growth and pursuing a disciplined acquisition, investment, and partnership strategy. The anticipated benefits from acquisitions and other strategic transactions may not be fully realized, and various factors may adversely affect any anticipated benefits. We are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity and protection of confidential information, and the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data could damage our competitive position. The financial services industry is highly regulated and subject to potential increased regulation, which could impact our operations and competitive position. Changes in the legislative, regulatory, and commercial environments may materially and adversely impact our ability to operate effectively. We recognize that our business is dependent on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees, and our brand and reputation are key assets that may be affected by external perceptions. The financial benchmarks industry is subject to new regulations that could impose additional operating obligations and increase compliance risk. Our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and regulatory environments is crucial for sustaining competitive advantage and ensuring organizational resilience.

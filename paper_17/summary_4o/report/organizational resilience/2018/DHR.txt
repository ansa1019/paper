The company is subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as market conditions, economic conditions, geopolitical events, and changes in laws and regulations, which could impair its business and financial condition. The company’s growth depends in part on the growth of the markets it serves, and visibility into these markets is limited, particularly for markets served through distribution. The company faces intense competition and must retain longstanding relationships with major customers while continuing to develop new products and services to maintain its competitive advantage. The company’s operations are affected by worldwide, regional, and industry-specific economic and political factors, and its geographic and industry diversity help limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on its consolidated operating results. The company is making significant investments to address the rapid pace of technological change in its served markets and to globalize its manufacturing, research and development, and customer-facing resources, particularly in high-growth markets, to improve operational efficiency. The company’s ability to grow revenues, earnings, and cash flow depends on its ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies. The company’s restructuring activities could slow improvements in its products and services and may trigger adverse public attention. The company’s operations, products, and services expose it to environmental, health, and safety liabilities, costs, and violations that could adversely affect its reputation and financial statements. The company’s reliance on information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information is critical, and any significant disruption in these systems could interrupt operations and result in legal claims and increased costs for security and remediation. The company’s financial results are subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of commodities, and any sustained interruption in the supply of these items could adversely affect its business. The company’s ability to maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls with respect to global data privacy and security requirements is essential to prevent data breaches, which could lead to regulatory consequences and reputational damage. The company’s businesses are subject to extensive regulation, and failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect its financial statements and business. The company’s growth could suffer if the markets into which it sells its products and services decline or do not grow as anticipated. The company’s ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from challenging situations is critical to its resilience. The company’s management assesses its liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing, and financing requirements, and it continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities. The company’s operational flexibility is impacted by its ability to adjust its manufacturing capacity and the purchases required for its manufacturing activities to reflect changes in market conditions and customer demand. The company’s strategic initiatives include developing innovative and differentiated new products and services with higher gross profit margins, which are essential for maintaining its competitive position and financial performance.

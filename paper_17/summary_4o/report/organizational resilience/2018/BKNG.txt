The risks and uncertainties described in this annual report should be carefully considered, as they may impair our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Economic or political disruptions could cause, contribute to, or be indicative of deteriorating macro-economic conditions, which in turn could negatively affect travel demand and our results of operations. Unforeseen events beyond our control, such as natural disasters, political instability, and health concerns, can disrupt travel and limit the ability or willingness of travelers to visit certain locations, resulting in declines in travel demand. The uncertainty of macro-economic factors and their impact on consumer behavior makes it more difficult to forecast industry trends and could adversely affect our ability to effectively manage our business. We face intense competition that could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance, as the markets for our services are constantly evolving and subject to rapid change. Our international businesses have historically achieved significant year-over-year growth, but these growth rates have generally declined, a trend we expect to continue. The complexity of our business increases with expansion, placing additional strain on our management, operations, and financial resources. We may not be able to hire, train, retain, motivate, and manage required employees, which may limit our growth and negatively affect our financial performance. Our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies and consumer demands is critical for maintaining our competitive advantage. We rely on performance and brand marketing channels to generate traffic to our platforms, and maintaining and strengthening our brands is essential for attracting and retaining customers. Changes in the competitive landscape, including the actions of larger competitors, may impact our ability to maintain or grow our market share. Our business is also exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which can affect consumer travel behavior. We may face risks related to the growth rate and global expansion of our business, as compliance with legal, regulatory, or tax requirements in multiple jurisdictions places demands on our resources. We have experienced volatility in transaction growth rates and increased cancellation rates, which we believe are due, at least in part, to macro-economic conditions and concerns. The integration of acquired businesses requires significant time and resources, and we may not manage these processes successfully. Our financial results are driven by certain operating metrics that capture the volume of units booked through our travel reservation services. We believe that continuing to expand the number and variety of accommodations available through our services will help us grow our accommodation reservation business. Our strategy involves continued investment in marketing and technology to improve long-term operating results, even if those expenditures create pressure on operating margins. The uncertain and highly competitive environment makes predicting future results of operations difficult, and we may not be able to sustain revenue growth and profitability.

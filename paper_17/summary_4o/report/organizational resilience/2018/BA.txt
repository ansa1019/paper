An investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties, and our actual results and future trends may differ materially from our past or projected future performance. Our commercial airplanes and global services businesses depend heavily on commercial airlines and are subject to unique risks. Market conditions significantly impact demand for our commercial aircraft and related services, and the commercial aircraft market is predominantly driven by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic. Demand for our commercial aircraft is influenced by airline profitability, availability of aircraft financing, and various external pressures including world trade policies and environmental regulations. The airline industry has traditionally been cyclical and competitive, experiencing significant profit swings and constant challenges to remain cost-competitive. A significant deterioration in the global economic environment or the financial stability of major customers could result in fewer new orders or cause customers to postpone or cancel orders, affecting our revenues and profitability. Our ability to maintain a healthy production system, achieve planned production rate targets, and meet stringent performance and reliability standards is critical. We must minimize disruption caused by production changes and achieve productivity improvements to meet customer demand and maintain profitability. Operational challenges impacting the production system could result in delays and negatively affect our revenues and operating margins. Our commercial aircraft production system is complex, involving extensive coordination with suppliers and regulatory requirements. Delays or defects in supplier components or failure to meet internal performance plans could lead to increased production costs and delayed deliveries. We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from U.S. government contracts, which are subject to unique risks and extensive procurement regulations. Changes to these regulations could increase our costs and affect our operating margins. The uncertainty surrounding future U.S. defense spending levels and the nature of the threat environment may lead to cost-cutting initiatives that impact our revenues and market share. Our business may also be impacted by disruptions including cyber-attacks, natural disasters, and public health crises, which could affect our internal operations and our ability to deliver products and services. We rely on a network of suppliers and subcontractors, and disruptions in their performance could adversely affect our ability to meet commitments to customers. Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities, and we are subject to various laws and regulations related to environmental protection. The complexity of our long-term contracts requires careful estimation of sales, costs, and profit, and changes in these estimates could significantly impact our financial performance. We continue to monitor the potential for disruptions and adverse revenue impacts from geopolitical developments and tariffs. Our strategy focuses on successful execution in core businesses, improving efficiency, and maintaining competitive advantages while adapting to changing market conditions.

The business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects of the company are subject to a variety of risks, many of which are beyond its control, including regulatory, legislative, and legal risks that could materially adversely affect its operations. The company must address the effects of regulation on its business, and any inability or failure to do so could have a material adverse effect. The operations are subject to complex and comprehensive federal, state, and other regulations, which may require the company to cancel or delay planned development activities or incur costs that may not be recoverable through rates. The company is also exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness and performance of customers, hedging counterparties, and vendors, which could result in material financial losses and operational disruptions. The company’s ability to proceed with projects under development may be adversely affected by escalating costs, inability to obtain necessary licenses, and disputes involving contractors and governmental entities. Severe weather and natural disasters can cause power outages and property damage, requiring the company to incur additional costs for restoration and repairs. The company faces risks related to project siting, financing, construction, permitting, and governmental approvals that may impede its development and operating activities. The operational risks could result in lost revenues, increased expenses, and liability to third parties. The company’s business may be negatively affected by a lack of growth or slower growth in customer usage, which directly influences the demand for electricity and the need for additional power generation facilities. Changes in weather can also impact electricity production and require the company to incur additional costs. The company is subject to the potentially adverse operating and financial effects of terrorist acts and threats, including cyber attacks, which could materially adversely affect its operations and financial condition. The company’s insurance coverage may not provide protection against all significant losses, and the inability to obtain insurance on acceptable terms could require the company to pay costs associated with adverse future events. The company’s liquidity and ability to access credit and capital markets are dependent on its credit ratings, and any downgrade could impair its ability to raise capital or increase its cost of capital. The company must maintain a capital structure that supports a strong investment-grade credit rating, and any inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on its business. The company’s significant accounting policies include accounting for derivatives and hedging activities, which are critical for managing risks associated with commodity prices and interest rates. The company’s operations are highly dependent on sophisticated information technology systems, and any failure or breach of those systems could materially adversely affect its ability to fulfill critical business functions. The company also faces risks related to the management of its pension plan and the potential impact of changes in market conditions on its funded status. The company’s ability to adapt to changing regulatory environments and market conditions is essential for maintaining its operational resilience and ensuring long-term sustainability.

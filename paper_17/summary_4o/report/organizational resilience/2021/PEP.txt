The impact of COVID-19 continues to create considerable uncertainty for our business, exposing us to risks associated with the pandemic. Numerous measures implemented globally to reduce the spread of the virus have impacted our operations and those of our business partners and consumers. We have seen changes in consumer demand, including the inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine, or other restrictions, which can result in bankruptcy filings and/or an inability to pay for our products. We may continue to experience business disruptions resulting from temporary closures of our facilities or those of our business partners, or the inability of a significant portion of our workforce to work due to illness or governmental restrictions. Additionally, we may see adverse impacts to our supply chain through raw material shortages, labor shortages, or reduced availability of transport, which can negatively impact our business. The ongoing economic uncertainty associated with the pandemic has resulted in volatility in the global capital and credit markets, impairing our ability to access these markets on commercially acceptable terms. We have developed and implemented health and safety protocols, business continuity plans, and crisis management protocols to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 on our employees and business. The extent of the pandemic's impact on our business remains uncertain and will depend on numerous evolving factors, including the duration and scope of the pandemic and changes in consumer behavior. Our ability to innovate and effectively respond to shifts in consumer trends and preferences is critical, as consumer preferences continuously evolve due to various factors, including changes in demographics and consumption patterns. Our business operations are subject to disruption by natural disasters or other events beyond our control, which could negatively impact product availability and decrease demand if our crisis management plans do not effectively resolve these issues. We must maintain a positive reputation globally, as damage to our brand image can adversely affect our business. Our reputation has been impacted by failures to maintain high ethical, business, and environmental practices, as well as health concerns about our products. The competitive landscape is characterized by pressures from international beverage and food companies, as well as regional and local brands. Our ability to compete effectively depends on our capacity to anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and trends, including through strategic investments in data analytics. The retail landscape continues to evolve, with significant growth in e-commerce channels, and our business will be adversely affected if we fail to develop successful relationships with these retailers. We are subject to risks inherent in international operations, including economic, political, and social conditions that can adversely impact our business. Our reliance on third-party service providers and enterprise-wide systems can also affect our operations, particularly if these providers fail to meet their obligations. We are committed to building a resilient organization that can adapt to these challenges through strategic initiatives, resource management, and continuous improvement in operational flexibility and effectiveness.

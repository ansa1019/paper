The ongoing public health crisis posed by COVID-19 has required AbbVie to modify its business practices, including instituting remote work for many employees, and may necessitate further actions to ensure the safety of employees, patients, customers, and business partners. AbbVie continues to closely manage manufacturing and supply chain resources around the world to help ensure that patients receive an uninterrupted supply of their medicines. The impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie's operations has not been material to date, but the company has experienced lower new patient starts in certain products and markets, and the long-term effects remain uncertain and could negatively impact its results of operations. The extent of the adverse impact will depend on the severity of the continued spread of COVID-19 globally and the timing and nature of actions taken in response.

AbbVie’s strategic planning includes anticipating future needs and adapting to changing market conditions, which is essential for sustaining its business in a turbulent environment. The company’s emphasis on innovation and the development of new products is vital for its long-term success and resilience in the face of challenges.

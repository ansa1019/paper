Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk, and our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including the ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform itself to emerge stronger from challenging situations. Our future success is dependent on our ability to successfully develop additional product candidates for both cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF indications, which requires effective resource allocation and operational flexibility. We may experience incremental pricing pressure on our products, which could reduce our revenues and future profitability, and we face risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, which has impacted our operations and may affect our ability to maintain business continuity. Our ability to execute on our long-term strategy depends in part on our ability to engage in transactions and collaborations with other entities that add to our pipeline or provide us with new commercial opportunities. We rely on a worldwide network of third-party manufacturers and our internal capabilities to manufacture our products and the materials required for our clinical trials, and disruptions in these relationships could adversely affect our operational management and performance. The successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain and subject to numerous risks, including regulatory approval delays and the need for significant financial resources. We are also subject to various and evolving laws and regulations governing the privacy and security of personal data, and our failure to comply could adversely affect our business and organizational health. Our ability to attract and retain skilled employees is crucial, as the highly technical nature of our drug discovery and development activities requires qualified personnel. We have made significant investments in research and development, and our strategy includes advancing multiple compounds from each program into early clinical trials, which reflects our commitment to organizational resilience and adaptability in the face of external pressures. The complexity of our supply chain and the need for effective risk management strategies are essential for maintaining operational continuity. We are focused on ensuring the stability of our supply chains for our current products, as well as for our pipeline programs, and we continuously monitor the results of our discovery, research, clinical trials, and nonclinical studies to balance risk and potential. Our business environment is characterized by significant competition, and we must demonstrate improved safety, efficacy, and market acceptance to succeed. Our investments in product candidates are subject to considerable risks, and we closely evaluate our product development programs in light of new data and scientific insights. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has added complexity to our operations, and we are utilizing a site-specific approach to assess and permit employee access to our sites. We have adopted a business continuity plan to address crises, but any failure to implement these plans could result in significant disruptions to our research, development, manufacturing, and commercial activities. Our ability to manage operations effectively is crucial for our business success, and we must enhance our operational and financial infrastructure to meet the demands of our expanding global operations.

Our operations and structure involve various risks that could adversely affect our business and financial condition, including risks related to our global operations, business continuity, and external pressures. As a global company, we are subject to social, political, and economic risks of doing business in many countries, which may impact our ability to maintain operational flexibility and adapt to unexpected situations. Disruptions in the global capital and credit markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, impacting our ability to make principal and interest payments or refinance outstanding debt. We are exposed to economic conditions and events in the local, regional, national, and international geographies where we own properties, which could affect our firm performance and operational continuity. Our investments are concentrated in the logistics sector, making us vulnerable to economic downturns in that sector, and any material oversupply or reduction in demand for logistics space could adversely affect our overall business. We seek to mitigate risks through geographic diversification of our portfolio and by maintaining sufficient liquidity to respond to adverse conditions. Our ability to access capital markets is critical for our operational management and strategic initiatives, particularly during periods of market volatility. We may face challenges in establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate operations in different geographies, which could impact our organizational health and resilience strategies. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has introduced additional uncertainties, affecting our customers' ability to enter into new leasing transactions or satisfy rental payments, thereby impacting our cash flow and operational effectiveness. We continuously evaluate our risk management strategies to ensure we can adapt to environmental disruptions and maintain our organizational capabilities. Our strategic planning includes assessing the potential impacts of future climate change and implementing measures to enhance our resilience against catastrophic weather events. We also recognize the importance of maintaining strong relationships with our partners and stakeholders to foster collaboration networks that enhance our organizational resilience. Our organizational practices focus on knowledge management and the ability to absorb strain while preserving or improving functioning despite adversity. We are committed to ensuring that our operational resources are effectively deployed to support our major objectives and enhance our competitive advantage in turbulent markets. The complexity of our operations requires us to be proactive in our crisis management efforts, ensuring we are prepared for potential disruptions and can recover swiftly from adverse events. We prioritize the development of adaptive strategies that enable us to confront challenges and leverage opportunities for growth, thereby enhancing our organizational strength and ensuring long-term sustainability.

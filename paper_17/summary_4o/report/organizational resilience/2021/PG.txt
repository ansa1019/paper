We discuss our expectations regarding future performance, events, and outcomes, as well as our business outlook and objectives. Our business is subject to numerous risks, including macroeconomic conditions and related financial risks, which may adversely affect our operations and financial performance. We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations and localized volatility, which could impact our competitiveness and overall cash flows. Additionally, our results could be adversely impacted by political volatility, labor market disruptions, and other crises in individual countries or regions. Uncertain economic or social conditions may adversely impact demand for our products, potentially causing financial hardship for our customers and other business partners. Disruptions in credit markets or changes to our credit ratings may reduce our access to credit or overall liquidity, which could adversely affect our capital resources. Our ability to manage disruptions in our global supply chain is critical to meeting customer needs and achieving cost targets. The loss or disruption of key manufacturing and supply arrangements could interrupt product supply and adversely impact our financial condition. Our business results depend on our ability to manage cost fluctuations and pressures, including changes in commodity prices and labor costs. We must successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends to maintain sales and profit margins. The ability to achieve our business objectives depends on how well we can compete in new and existing markets and channels. Our success relies on managing relationships with our retail trade customers and ensuring that we can meet their needs. The reputation of the company and our brands is foundational to our relationships with stakeholders, and any significant harm to our reputation could materially impact our financial results. We rely on third parties for various functions, and failure to manage these relationships could adversely affect our operations. A significant information security incident or operational technology failure could materially impact our business or reputation. We must manage the demand, supply, and operational challenges associated with disease outbreaks, including pandemics, which may significantly reduce demand for our products or disrupt our manufacturing and supply arrangements. Our business strategy includes ongoing acquisition, joint venture, and divestiture activities, which must be effectively managed to achieve our business objectives. We must also successfully manage productivity improvements and organizational change, including attracting and retaining key talent. Our financial projections assume ongoing productivity improvements and cost savings, and failure to deliver these could adversely impact our results. We are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations, and failure to comply could negatively impact our reputation and business results. The company has undertaken a strategic focus to strengthen its business portfolio and enhance operational effectiveness, which is critical for delivering total shareholder return. We believe that maintaining operational continuity and effectively managing risks associated with external disturbances are essential for organizational resilience and long-term success.

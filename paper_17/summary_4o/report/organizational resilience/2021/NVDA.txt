In evaluating NVIDIA, the following risk factors should be considered, as they could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, or reputation. Our strategic and business success depends on our ability to timely identify emerging industry changes and develop new or enhance existing products, services, and technologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets. If we fail to adapt our strategies as market conditions evolve, our business will be harmed. Competition in our current and target markets could prevent us from growing our revenue. Our target markets remain competitive, and competition may intensify with expanding and changing product and service offerings, industry standards, and customer needs. We face several risks that could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand and scale our supply chain, negatively impacting longer-term demand for our products and services. These risks include the lack of guaranteed supply of wafers and components, failure by our foundries to procure raw materials, and the limited number of global suppliers. Our operations could be disrupted by natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, or geopolitical tensions, which could harm our operations and increase our costs. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our workforce and operations, and as it continues to evolve, the increased duration and impact of economic and demand uncertainty may have a material net negative impact on our business and financial results. We believe our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs, but we continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources to ensure we can finance our future capital requirements. We have made considerable investments in research and development and business offerings in markets where we have a limited operating history, which may not produce meaningful revenue for several years. The ability to recover from disruptions, including those caused by the pandemic, is critical to maintaining operational continuity. Our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our business processes and information systems, and any modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business. We rely on internal processes and information systems to support key business functions, and the efficient operation of these processes is critical. The identification of material weaknesses in our internal controls may cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements. We also face risks related to business trends that may be influenced by climate change concerns, which could negatively impact our business. Our operations, products, and services may be subject to climate-related laws and regulations, which could result in greater direct costs and impact our ability to operate effectively. We must continue to develop our security measures and ensure our suppliers have appropriate security measures in place to defend against cyber-attacks, which are increasingly sophisticated. Our ability to recover from ransomware attacks may be limited if our backups have been affected by the attack. Overall, our ability to maintain positive adjustment under challenging conditions is influenced by these various factors, which collectively contribute to our organizational resilience.

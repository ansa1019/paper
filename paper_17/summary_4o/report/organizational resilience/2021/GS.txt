We face a variety of risks that are substantial and inherent in our businesses, including market conditions that have adversely affected our businesses and may continue to do so in the future. Our liquidity, profitability, and businesses may be adversely affected by an inability to access the debt capital markets or to sell assets. A failure in our operational systems or infrastructure, as well as human error, could impair our liquidity, disrupt our businesses, and cause losses. We may incur losses as a result of unforeseen or catastrophic events, including pandemics, terrorist attacks, extreme weather events, or other natural disasters. Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation, and a failure to appropriately identify and address potential conflicts of interest could adversely affect our businesses. We are also subject to risks related to operational resilience, including the risk of disruption to our critical processes, which we monitor and assess to ensure that our state of readiness is maintained in the event of significant operational disruptions. Our approach to business continuity planning is designed to ensure that critical functions can continue to operate in the event of a disruption. We have established a comprehensive operational risk management framework that includes policies requiring all employees to report and escalate operational risk events. Our risk management processes are designed to identify, assess, monitor, and manage the risks we assume in conducting our activities. We employ a variety of risk measures to monitor market risk, including value-at-risk and stress tests, to assess our exposure to potential losses. Our liquidity risk management policies are designed to ensure we have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations and meet our obligations during periods of market stress. We maintain a diversified funding profile and seek to limit the principal amount of debt maturing over the course of any monthly, quarterly, or annual time horizon to mitigate refinancing risk. Our contingency funding plan outlines our potential responses in the event of a liquidity crisis, including pre-funding for estimated cash and collateral needs. We also conduct regular stress tests to quantify our liquidity risks and assess our ability to withstand adverse market conditions. Our credit risk management process includes monitoring compliance with established credit risk limits, assessing the likelihood of counterparty defaults, and using credit risk mitigants such as collateral and hedging. We have a comprehensive framework to monitor, measure, and assess our country exposures and to determine our risk appetite. We continuously evaluate and enhance our climate risk management framework, integrating climate-related risks into our broader risk management processes. Our operational risk management framework has evolved based on the changing needs of our businesses and regulatory guidance, ensuring that we maintain our exposure to operational risk at levels within our risk appetite. We recognize that effective risk management is critical to our success, and we have established an enterprise risk management framework that employs a comprehensive, integrated approach to risk management.

The following discussion addresses significant factors, events, and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky and provides important information for understanding our operations. We must manage fluctuating demand for our services and network capacity, as significant reductions in demand can lead to increased costs associated with resizing our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. We continue to improve our transportation plan, add capacity, and enhance our ability to address surges in demand with adequate resources. Operational difficulties related to network capacity and dramatic fluctuations in demand could negatively impact our operational efficiency. We transport hazardous materials, which pose risks in the event of a release or combustion, and a rail accident could involve significant costs and claims that could adversely affect our financial condition. We rely on technology improvements in our business operations, and insufficient capital deployment for technology could result in a competitive disadvantage. Cybersecurity risks are also present, as we may experience varying degrees of cyber incidents that could disrupt our systems and have a material adverse impact on our results. Severe weather conditions and natural phenomena could result in significant business interruptions, despite our planning efforts. We are exposed to significant governmental regulation, and failure to comply could adversely affect our operations. Labor disputes and the availability of qualified personnel could compromise our service reliability and operational efficiency. Our business and financial condition have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused disruptions in global supply chains and economic activity. We expect uncertainties related to COVID-19 to continue, which could impact our operating results. Our capital plan includes investments to improve operational performance and efficiency, and we are focused on maintaining a healthy workplace while adapting to the evolving environment. We will continue to utilize technology, risk assessments, training, and employee engagement to enhance safety and operational resilience. Our network operations faced challenges that required adjustments to our transportation plans, impacting overall fluidity. We are committed to improving resource utilization and operational flexibility to enhance service reliability. Our financial expectations indicate that we expect volume to outpace industrial production, driven by business development efforts. We will focus on efficiently managing operations, protecting our employees and customers, and providing excellent service. Our capital plan aims to harden our infrastructure and improve the safety and resilience of the network, with targeted acquisitions and investments to drive growth. We continuously evaluate our financial condition and liquidity, maintaining adequate resources to meet foreseeable cash requirements. Our access to liquidity through capital markets is dependent on our financial stability, and we expect to continue to have access to various sources of liquidity to support our operations.

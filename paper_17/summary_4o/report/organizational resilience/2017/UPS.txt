The organizationâ€™s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity is critical for maintaining operational continuity. Our business is subject to complex and stringent regulation in the U.S. and internationally, which may alter the landscape in which we operate and affect our costs of doing business. We continuously monitor and manage our exposures to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates, utilizing derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of these changes on our financial position and results of operations. The transportation industry continues to consolidate, and competition remains strong; if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to competitive pressures, our business, financial position, and results of operations could be adversely affected. Our operations are also impacted by severe weather conditions and other natural or manmade disasters, which may result in decreased revenues or increased costs to operate our business. We make significant capital investments in our business, and accurately forecasting our future capital investment needs is essential to avoid excess or insufficient capacity that could negatively affect our revenues and profitability. Our business is exposed to various claims and litigation, and any material litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. We have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiatives, information technology risk management, and disaster recovery plans to enhance our resilience against cyber threats and system disruptions. The increasing complexity of our operational environment necessitates a focus on strategic initiatives that promote organizational health and adaptability. We rely heavily on information technology networks and systems to manage critical business processes, and disruptions in these systems could adversely affect our operations and reputation. Our ability to maintain the image of our brand and our reputation for providing excellent service is vital for sustaining customer trust and demand for our services. We are committed to developing a trajectory model of organizational resilience that focuses on how we project responses toward disruptive events and reconfigure our strategies to emerge stronger from challenges. The potential obligation to provide coordinating benefits under multiemployer pension plans introduces uncertainties that could materially affect our financial obligations. We recognize that our organizational practices must evolve to address the dynamic capabilities required for effective crisis management and operational flexibility in the face of external pressures and environmental disruptions. Our financial performance is influenced by the need for continuous adaptation to changing market conditions, including the impact of climate change regulations and the necessity for compliance with evolving security requirements. We strive to enhance our organizational resilience through proactive measures, strategic foresight, and by fostering collaboration networks that support our operational management and resource deployment strategies.

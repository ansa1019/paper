The organizationâ€™s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity is critical. We face significant governmental action aimed at increasing regulatory requirements, which could reduce consumption levels and increase the risk of counterfeiting and contraband. Our business environment is influenced by economic, regulatory, and political developments, as well as natural disasters or conflicts that could disrupt our supply chain, manufacturing capabilities, or distribution capabilities. We must anticipate and respond to changes in adult consumer preferences, which may be influenced by local economic conditions. Our success relies on promoting brand equity, developing new products, and ensuring adequate production capacity to meet demand. The competitive environment can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions and competitors' introduction of innovative products. We are committed to developing and commercializing reduced-risk products that present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking. Our strategic initiatives aim to strengthen our brand portfolio and market positions through selective acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships. We recognize that the failure of our information systems could result in business disruption and loss of revenue, necessitating robust business continuity plans. We have backup systems in place to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access. Our ability to grow profitability may be limited by our inability to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully. We may be required to replace third-party contract manufacturers or service providers with our own resources, which could significantly increase our costs. Our operations are subject to various risks, including litigation related to tobacco use and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, which could substantially reduce our profitability. The impact of climate change may also increase the cost or reduce the quality of the tobacco and other agricultural products used to manufacture our products. The regulatory landscape is evolving, and we must adapt to significant changes that could affect our competitive position. Our business strategy includes developing a trajectory model of organizational resilience that focuses on how we project responses toward disruptive events and reconfigure our strategies in response to these challenges. We are committed to maintaining operational flexibility and adapting to unexpected situations to ensure organizational health and effectiveness.

Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including intense competition and the need to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users, which are essential for maintaining our competitive advantage. The rapid evolution of our businesses, characterized by changing technologies and shifting user needs, necessitates significant resource allocation to research and development to enhance our technology and existing products. The emergence of new products and services can present technological and legal challenges that may negatively impact our brand and demand, affecting our operational flexibility and ability to respond to external pressures. We generate substantially all of our revenues from advertising, and any reduction in spending by advertisers could harm our business continuity. Our ongoing investment in new businesses and technologies carries inherent risks that could disrupt our current operations and affect our organizational health. The internet's evolution across various platforms requires us to adapt our products and services continually to meet user needs effectively, which is critical for maintaining performance under pressure. Our revenue growth may decline over time due to increasing competition and changes in device and product mix, which could impact our operational resources and strategic response capabilities. We face increasing regulatory scrutiny that may disrupt our business practices and affect our ability to respond to environmental disturbances. Our international operations expose us to additional risks, including compliance with complex laws and regulations, which may impact our organizational resilience. We regularly encounter claims and government investigations that could result in adverse outcomes, impacting our organizational effectiveness and financial condition. The interruption or failure of our information technology systems could hinder our ability to provide products and services effectively, necessitating robust crisis management and emergency preparedness strategies. We are committed to maintaining strong brands and enhancing our organizational identity, which is vital for our success in a competitive landscape. Our employees are critical to our success, and we expect to continue investing in their development and retention to foster a culture of innovation and adaptability. The ongoing shift to online advertising and the increasing use of multiple devices require us to remain agile and responsive to user behavior changes. Our strategic initiatives focus on expanding our offerings and improving our operational management to navigate the complexities of the digital economy. We anticipate that our research and development expenses will continue to increase as we invest in new technologies and capabilities to sustain our growth and resilience in the face of adversity. The successful execution of our business strategy relies on our ability to foresee and confront challenges, leveraging our organizational capabilities to thrive in turbulent markets.

Regulators increasingly seek to regulate certain aspects of payments systems, which may impose obligations or restrictions that could conflict with each other, potentially impacting our ability to innovate or offer differentiated products and services. Increased regulation may result in costly compliance burdens, adversely affecting our profitability and limiting our operational flexibility. The complexity of regulatory changes could lead to new criteria for participation in our payments system, which may affect our competitive advantage and ability to adapt to external pressures. Our business continuity strategies are essential to manage risks associated with compliance and regulatory changes, ensuring we maintain operational integrity under challenging conditions.

The risks described indicate that our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected by economic conditions in the U.S. and international markets, which may lead to a general downturn in the restaurant industry. Our success depends substantially on the value of our brands, and failure to preserve their value could negatively impact our financial results. We believe we must preserve, grow, and leverage the value of our brands across all sales channels, particularly in international markets where brand recognition is less established. Business incidents that erode consumer trust, such as breaches of privacy or food safety issues, can significantly reduce brand value and result in civil and criminal liability. The unauthorized access, use, theft, or destruction of customer or employee data could impact our reputation and brand, exposing us to potential liability and loss of revenues. We rely heavily on information technology systems, and any material failure or security breach could harm our ability to operate effectively and adversely affect our financial results. Our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the production, distribution, and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability and integrity of these systems. We may not be successful in implementing important strategic initiatives or effectively managing growth, which may adversely impact our business and financial results. Factors that may affect the successful implementation of these initiatives include increases in labor costs, competition, and disruptions caused by online commerce. We face intense competition in each of our channels and markets, which could lead to reduced profitability. Our financial performance is highly dependent on our Americas operating segment, and a slowdown in revenue trends could adversely affect our overall business. We are increasingly dependent on the success of certain international markets to achieve our growth targets, and the performance of these operations may be adversely affected by economic downturns or other market-specific challenges. Interruptions in our supply chain could affect our ability to produce or deliver products, negatively impacting our profitability. Our financial condition and results of operations are sensitive to various factors, many of which are outside our control, including severe weather, geopolitical events, and labor discord. We must continue to recruit, retain, and motivate management and other employees to maintain our business and execute our strategic initiatives. Failure to comply with applicable laws and changing regulatory requirements could harm our business and financial results. Our policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws, but the complexity of the regulatory environment is increasing. We evaluate our exposure to various risks, including market risks related to commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates, and we manage these risks through various strategies, including hedging transactions. The ability to foresee, confront, and benefit from sudden disruptive changes is essential for our survival and growth.

Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those related to our ability to manage future growth effectively and improve our systems, processes, and controls. The growth and expansion of our business place significant strain on our management, operational, and financial resources. To manage future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes efficiently. We may face difficulties in managing improvements to our systems, processes, and controls, or in connection with third-party software licensed to help us with such improvements. Any future growth would add complexity to our organization and require effective coordination throughout. Our operating results may vary significantly from period to period and be unpredictable, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. We have experienced revenue growth rates, but we expect variation to continue as a result of factors outside our control, including our ability to attract and retain new end-customers, changes in end-customer requirements, and the timing and success of new product introductions. Our ability to expand our business domestically and internationally is critical, and we must navigate changes in the competitive landscape, including price competition and the timing of revenue recognition. Additionally, we are exposed to risks associated with political, economic, and social instability, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Our reliance on channel partners to sell substantially all of our products exposes us to risks if these partners fail to perform. We must accurately predict, prepare for, and respond promptly to rapidly evolving technological and market developments. The enterprise security market is expected to continue to evolve rapidly, and we must manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues and the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory. Our corporate culture fosters innovation and teamwork, which are essential for maintaining organizational resilience. However, as we grow, we may find it difficult to maintain these aspects of our culture. Our future success depends on our ability to attract, integrate, train, and retain qualified personnel, particularly in engineering and sales. Competition for skilled personnel is intense, and any failure to hire and retain such personnel could negatively impact our growth and operating margins. We are also subject to various environmental laws and regulations, and our failure to comply could result in reputational damage and other sanctions. Our business is subject to risks of catastrophic events, including natural disasters and terrorism, which could disrupt our operations and impact our ability to fulfill customer orders. We must continue to invest in research and development to maintain our competitive position and adapt to changing market conditions. Our ability to manage our supply chain effectively is critical to our operational continuity and resilience in the face of external pressures.

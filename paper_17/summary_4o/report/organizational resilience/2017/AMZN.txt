We face intense competition as our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, which places significant strain on our management, operational, financial, and other resources. Our expansion into new products, services, technologies, and geographic regions subjects us to additional business, legal, financial, and competitive risks. We may not be able to manage growth effectively, which could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results. Our international operations expose us to a number of risks, including local economic and political conditions and government regulation of e-commerce and other services. The complexity of our business increases with our expansion, and we may not be able to operate our fulfillment network and data centers effectively, which could harm our business. We also rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory, and any performance problems could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience. Our ability to retain and expand our network of sellers and satisfy customer demands is critical, and we may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and growth rate. We seek to improve all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, and increasing selection, which are essential for maintaining operational flexibility and adapting to customer needs. Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows, which are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects support a variety of product and service offerings, and we expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements to accommodate anticipated shipment volumes and improve process efficiencies. Our operating expenses reflect the investments we make in order to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments. We face risks related to system interruption and lack of redundancy, as our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by various events, which could prevent us from fulfilling customer orders and providing services. The seasonality of our business places increased strain on our operations, particularly during peak periods, and we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers. Our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making, integrating, and maintaining commercial agreements and strategic alliances, which create additional risks such as disruption of our ongoing business and variability in revenue. We are also subject to risks related to government contracts, product liability claims, and payments-related risks, which could adversely affect our operating results. Our liquidity is affected by restricted cash balances and we continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities to strengthen our financial position. The 2017 tax act significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax, which may impact our financial position and results of operations. We regularly assess whether it is more likely than not that we will realize our deferred tax assets in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate, which reflects our organizational resilience strategies in managing financial risks.

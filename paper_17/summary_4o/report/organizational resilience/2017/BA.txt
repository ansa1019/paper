Our commercial airplanes and global services businesses depend heavily on commercial airlines, which are subject to unique risks and significant impacts from market conditions. The commercial aircraft market is predominantly driven by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic, influenced by factors such as sustained economic growth and political stability. The cyclical nature of the airline industry presents constant challenges to maintain operational flexibility and cost competitiveness. We must minimize disruption caused by production changes and achieve productivity improvements in order to meet customer demand and maintain our profitability. Our ability to maintain a healthy production system, achieve planned production rate targets, and meet stringent performance and reliability standards is critical for organizational resilience. Operational challenges impacting the production system could result in delays and negatively affect revenues and operating margins. We face significant risks associated with developing and manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet performance and reliability standards, particularly with newer aircraft programs. The introduction of new aircraft programs involves increased risks associated with meeting development, testing, production, and certification schedules. Our commercial aircraft production system is extremely complex, requiring extensive coordination and integration with suppliers and highly-skilled labor. Changes in levels of U.S. government defense spending and overall acquisition priorities could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations. We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from U.S. government contracts, which are subject to unique risks and extensive procurement regulations. Compliance with these regulations could increase our costs and impact our operating margins. The uncertainty surrounding government funding and potential budget cuts could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs, adversely affecting our financial performance. We are subject to various environmental regulations and could incur substantial costs if we violate these laws. Business disruptions, including threats to physical security, cyber-attacks, and natural disasters, could seriously affect our future sales and financial condition. Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities, and we must manage these risks effectively to maintain organizational health. We also face competition from domestic and international markets, which may reduce our future contracts and sales. The complexity of our business environment necessitates a focus on strategic initiatives and inter-organizational collaboration to enhance our competitive advantage. Our strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses, supplemented by Boeing Capital, which facilitates financing solutions for our customers. We continue to seek opportunities to reduce costs and improve efficiency, which will enhance our ability to adapt to changing market conditions. The organizational resilience of our operations is critical in navigating these challenges and ensuring sustained performance under pressure.

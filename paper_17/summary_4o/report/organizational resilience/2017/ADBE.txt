Our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements, and various factors could adversely affect our operations, performance, and financial condition. If we cannot continue to develop, acquire, market, and offer new products and services that meet customer requirements, our operating results could suffer. The process of developing and acquiring new technology products and services and enhancing existing offerings is complex, costly, and uncertain. If we fail to anticipate customers' rapidly changing needs and expectations or adapt to emerging technological trends, our market share and results of operations could suffer. We must make long-term investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand. Delays in the development, acquisition, marketing, or launch of new offerings could result in customer attrition or impede our ability to attract new customers, causing a decline in revenue and weakening our competitive position. Our competitive position and results of operations could be harmed if we do not compete effectively in markets characterized by intense competition, disruptive technology developments, and short product life cycles. Our future success will depend on our continued ability to enhance and integrate our existing products and services, introduce new offerings in a timely and cost-effective manner, and anticipate emerging standards and business models. The complexity of our sales cycles, particularly for enterprise offerings, is influenced by the need for significant evaluation processes and the negotiation of large contracts. Our subscription offerings could create risks related to the timing of revenue recognition, and any reduction in new or renewed subscriptions may not be reflected in our revenue results until later quarters. Security breaches in data centers we manage may compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of employee and customer data, which could expose us to liability and adversely affect our reputation. A disruption in our network infrastructure or third-party hosted services could cause system interruptions, reputational harm, and delays in product development. We rely on data centers to host and deliver our services, and any interruptions could expose us to liability and harm our business. Our ability to collect and report data may be delayed or interrupted by various factors, including security breaches or significant variability in visitor traffic. We devote significant resources to address security vulnerabilities, but these vulnerabilities cannot be totally eliminated. The introduction of new technology could harm our business if competing products achieve widespread acceptance. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future investments or acquisitions, and integration of acquisitions may disrupt our business. We are subject to risks associated with compliance with laws and regulations globally, which may harm our business. Our corporate culture, which fosters innovation and employee satisfaction, may be difficult to maintain as we grow and integrate new employees and businesses. Catastrophic events could disrupt our business, and climate change may have a long-term impact on our operations. We must manage our sales and distribution channels effectively to avoid loss of revenue and harm to our business. Our financial condition and future results may be adversely affected by changes in tax rules and regulations, and we are exposed to risks associated with compliance with laws and regulations globally.

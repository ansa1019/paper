Our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by various risks, including intense competition and rapid technological changes in the medical devices industry. We face significant competition across our product lines and in each market, which may impede our ability to maintain or improve our market share. The medical device markets are characterized by extensive research and development and rapid technological change, which necessitates continued efforts and resource allocation to develop or acquire advanced technologies and products. Failure to innovate or enhance existing products could materially affect our business and performance. We continue to experience pressures due to competitive activity, increased market power of customers, and economic pressures, which may adversely impact market sizes and our share of the markets. The healthcare industry is undergoing significant consolidation, resulting in increased competition and pricing pressures that could limit our ability to sell to certain market segments. Changes in government regulations and healthcare policies may also decrease demand for our products and impact pricing. Our international operations are subject to various market, business, and financial risks, including political and economic instability, which could adversely affect our ability to implement growth strategies. We are committed to enhancing our operational effectiveness and efficiency through restructuring and optimization initiatives aimed at improving our growth potential. However, these initiatives may yield unintended consequences such as business disruption and reduced employee productivity. We monitor the dynamics of the economy and the healthcare industry to assess opportunities for improvement while preserving our ability to invest in research and development. Our liquidity plans are subject to risks and uncertainties, including macroeconomic conditions and adverse litigation outcomes that could limit our ability to execute our business plans. We rely on information technology systems to operate our business, and any cyber-attack or breach could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Our operations are also affected by the need to comply with extensive and dynamic medical device regulations, which may impede the approval or sale of our products. The evolving regulatory environment could increase the time, cost, and complexity of obtaining approvals, impacting our ability to market our products. We are subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings that may require significant expenditures or impact our ability to sell our products. Our ability to attract and retain key personnel is critical to our success, and competition for such personnel is significant, particularly in emerging markets. The loss of key employees or delays in hiring could adversely affect our business. We continuously assess our operational strategies and the potential impact of external pressures to ensure organizational resilience and adaptability in a rapidly changing environment.

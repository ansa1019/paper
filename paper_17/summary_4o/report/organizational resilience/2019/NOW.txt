Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk, including risks related to our ability to grow our business in intensely competitive markets. Our business could be harmed by any of these risks, and competition could result in reduced sales, reduced margins, losses, or the failure of our products to achieve or maintain market acceptance. Privacy laws and concerns, evolving regulation of cloud computing, and other foreign and domestic regulations may adversely affect our business. Changing laws, regulations, and standards could impact our ability to develop our products and services, potentially restricting our ability to store, process, and share data with our customers. We must accurately predict, prepare for, and respond promptly to rapidly evolving technological, market, and customer developments to maintain our competitive position. Our operations involve the storage, transmission, and processing of our customers' confidential data, and while we have security measures in place, breaches may occur due to employee error or third-party actions. Cybersecurity threats are prevalent, and we devote significant resources to implement and maintain security measures; however, as these threats grow more complex, further investments may be necessary to protect our data and infrastructure. Natural disasters or catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, potentially leading to significant recovery time and adverse effects on our financial condition. We maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, but such events could make it difficult to deliver services to our customers. Our business depends upon the successful implementation of our products by our customers, and delays or inefficiencies in these implementations could result in significant costs and reputational harm. We face risks related to the procurement process and compliance with government contracting requirements, which may restrict our ability to sell into the government sector until we obtain necessary certifications. We rely on our network of partners for a substantial portion of our revenues, and if these partners fail to perform, our ability to sell and distribute our products may be limited. Our success depends largely upon the continued services of our management team and key individual contributors, and changes in our management team may result in a loss of institutional knowledge and cause disruptions to our business. We may experience difficulties in hiring and retaining highly-skilled employees, which could adversely affect our growth prospects. Our corporate culture, which fosters innovation and teamwork, is essential to our success, and maintaining this culture as we grow may be challenging. Our ability to adapt to changes in the competitive landscape and to manage risks associated with foreign markets will be critical to our future success. We expect our revenue growth rate to continue to decline, and our ability to maintain consistent revenue or revenue growth will be essential to our financial stability. The occurrence of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services may not be fully reflected in our results until future periods, highlighting the need for effective resource management and strategic foresight.

Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk, and you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below. Our future success is dependent upon our ability to increase revenues from sales of our CF medicines, which may require us to gain approval and reimbursement for our triple combination therapy in ex-U.S. markets and successfully develop and commercialize our therapy for patients with CF less than 12 years of age. Our concentrated source of revenues presents risks, including competition from therapies developed for CF and adverse developments with respect to the commercialization of our medicines. We have experienced challenges in obtaining reimbursement for our products outside the United States, and our future revenues will depend on our ability to obtain adequate reimbursement for our products. The reimbursement process can take a significant period of time and is subject to governmental control, which is increasingly limiting or regulating the price of drug products. Our medicines treat life-threatening conditions and address relatively small patient populations, and we have faced challenges in obtaining reimbursement in various countries. Our success in rapidly developing and commercializing our CF medicines may increase the resources that our competitors allocate to the development of potential competitive treatments. We face competition from major pharmaceutical companies and numerous smaller companies, which could adversely affect our business. Our ability to execute on our long-term strategy depends on engaging in transactions and collaborations that add to our pipeline or provide new commercial opportunities. We seek to license or acquire drugs, drug candidates, and technologies that complement our ongoing research and development efforts. Our ability to attract collaborators or external funding for the development and commercialization of our drug candidates is crucial, as is our ability to manage our global operations effectively. We are subject to various and evolving laws and regulations governing the privacy and security of personal information, and our failure to comply could adversely affect our business. Our research and development efforts involve the regulated use of hazardous materials, and we could be held liable for resulting damages if an accident occurs. We maintain and rely extensively on information technology systems, and a disruption or failure of these systems could materially adversely affect our business. Our ability to attract and retain skilled employees is critical, and competition for personnel is intense. We have adopted a business continuity plan to address crises, but if we are unable to fully implement these plans, we may experience significant disruptions in our operations. Our operational flexibility is essential to respond to unexpected situations and environmental perturbations. We are investing significant resources in the research and development of therapies for serious diseases, and our success depends on our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and regulatory environments. The increasing use of innovative specialty pharmaceuticals for rare diseases is generating significant interest from third-party payors, which may lead to adverse effects on our business. Our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected by our ability to manage risks associated with product liability claims, litigation, and compliance with regulatory requirements.

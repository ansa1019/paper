The industries that Applied serves can be volatile and difficult to predict, as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on various factors, including technology inflections and advances in fabrication processes. Applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity across its businesses to meet rapidly changing demand. During periods of increasing demand, Applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand, effectively manage its supply chain, and continue to control costs. Conversely, during periods of decreasing demand, Applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions. If Applied does not effectively manage these challenges during periods of changing demand, its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted. 

Applied is exposed to risks associated with operating a global business, including uncertain global economic and political conditions, which can adversely affect its business performance. The company is also subject to variations in local, regional, national, or international laws and regulations, which can impact its ability to maintain operational flexibility. Supply chain interruptions and service interruptions from utilities or other events beyond its control can hinder Applied's ability to manage operations effectively. The ability to attract, retain, and motivate key employees is vital to Applied's success, as fluctuations in global economic conditions and competition for talent can affect its organizational health.

Applied's strategic priorities include developing products that help solve customers' challenges at technology inflections and expanding its served market opportunities. The company must maintain a competitive advantage in the equipment and service products it provides, which requires substantial investments in research, development, and engineering to ensure the availability of innovative technology. Additionally, the need for Applied to adapt to changes in customer requirements and market trends is critical for its resilience. 

The global semiconductor and display industries are characterized by ongoing changes that impact demand for Applied's products and profitability. These changes include the increasing frequency and complexity of technology transitions, the need for customers to continually reduce manufacturing costs, and the heightened importance of system reliability and productivity. If Applied does not accurately forecast and allocate appropriate resources toward addressing key technology changes, its business and results of operations may be adversely impacted. 

Moreover, the company faces risks associated with business combinations and acquisitions, including the potential inability to realize expected revenues and synergies from acquired businesses. The integration of new operations and technologies requires effective management to capitalize on opportunities and mitigate risks. Applied's ability to successfully expand into new markets and industries may be adversely affected by various factors, including the complexity of managing multiple businesses and the need to develop new sales and technical marketing strategies. 

In summary, Applied must navigate a complex landscape of external pressures and internal capabilities to maintain its operational continuity and resilience in the face of disruptive events and market volatility.

The company’s business model expects its merchants to effectively react to frequently changing opportunities and trends in the market, assess the desirability and value of merchandise, and generally make determinations of how and what to source, as well as when and from where to source it. To respond to customer demand and effectively manage pricing and markdowns, the company needs to appropriately allocate and deliver merchandise to its stores, maintain an appropriate mix and level of inventory in each store, and be flexible in its allocation of floor space among product categories. The company has taken several steps to strengthen its financial position and maintain financial liquidity and flexibility, including suspending its share repurchase program, reviewing operating expenses, evaluating merchandise purchases, and reducing capital expenditures. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant disruptions, including the temporary closure of stores, online businesses, distribution centers, and offices, which are expected to adversely impact results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. The company continues to monitor developments and evaluate possible extensions to closures based on government requirements and recommendations. The company’s growth strategy includes successfully expanding within current markets and into new geographic regions, product lines, and channels, while managing substantial size and scale effectively. Managing growth can be challenging, and if any aspect of the expansion strategy does not achieve expected success, the company may fail to meet financial performance expectations or may be required to slow planned growth or close stores. The complexity of operations increases with size, which may add pressure to management and various functions across the business, including administration, systems, merchandising, store operations, distribution, logistics, and compliance. The company has implemented strategies to mitigate risks associated with the uncertainty surrounding Brexit, including realigning its European division's supply chain to reduce the volume of merchandise flowing between the UK and the EU. The company recognizes that economic conditions, including unemployment levels, disposable income availability, and geopolitical instability, could significantly affect consumer confidence and spending, which may adversely impact sales and performance. The company is subject to various risks associated with sourcing merchandise from other countries, including potential disruptions in manufacturing and supply, changes in trade restrictions, and compliance with product laws and regulations. The company’s operations depend on its information technology systems, which are targeted by attempts to disrupt business and access sensitive information. The reliance on these systems necessitates accurate anticipation of current and future information technology needs and successful development, implementation, and maintenance of appropriate systems. The company maintains policies and controls designed to reduce the risk of data security compromises and information technology failures. The company’s performance depends on recruiting, hiring, developing, training, and retaining talented associates in key areas, and challenges in securing and retaining sufficient talent could limit growth and adversely affect performance. The company’s ability to effectively manage its size and growth is critical to maintaining operational continuity and organizational resilience in the face of external pressures and disruptive events.

Our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by various risks, including intense competition and rapid technological changes in the medical devices industry, which necessitate the maintenance of operational flexibility and adaptability. The medical device markets are characterized by significant competition and external pressures, including economic pressures experienced by our customers and the impact of managed care organizations, which could adversely impact market sizes and our share of the markets in which we compete. We face pressures across many of our businesses due to competitive activity and the increasing market power of our customers, which may lead to declines in market size, average selling prices for our products, and medical procedure volumes. The healthcare industry is undergoing substantial structural and financial changes, leading to increased demands for price concessions and limiting our ability to sell to certain market segments. Our ability to respond effectively to these environmental disruptions and transform our operations is critical for maintaining competitive advantage and organizational health. We are committed to investing in research and development to innovate and enhance our product offerings, which is essential for our resilience strategy. The integration of acquired businesses requires significant efforts and poses risks that could adversely affect our business performance. Our restructuring initiatives are aimed at improving operational effectiveness and aligning expenses with revenues while ensuring that we can invest in strategic growth initiatives. However, these initiatives could yield unintended consequences, such as distraction of management and reduced employee productivity. We continuously monitor the dynamics of the economy and healthcare industry to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness, which is vital for our long-term success. Natural disasters, public health crises, and other catastrophic events could disrupt our supply chain and adversely affect our results of operations. Our products are designed and manufactured in technology centers around the world, and any interruption in manufacturing could lead to lengthy delays in production, loss of market share, and harm to our reputation. We rely on third-party vendors for materials and components, and disruptions in supply could adversely impact our financial condition. Our ability to manage our debt levels and maintain investment-grade credit ratings is crucial for our operational continuity. The evolving regulatory environment and compliance with extensive medical device regulations could impede our ability to obtain necessary approvals and market our products effectively. Our strategic acquisitions and investments are intended to expand our capabilities and enhance our market position, but we cannot guarantee their success. The successful integration of acquired companies and the achievement of synergies are critical for sustaining our growth trajectory. We are subject to various legal and regulatory risks that could impact our operations and financial condition. Our internal control processes are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting, which is essential for maintaining stakeholder trust and organizational resilience.

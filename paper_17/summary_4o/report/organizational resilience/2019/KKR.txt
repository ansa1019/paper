Investing in our securities involves risk, and our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by difficult market and economic conditions, which can reduce the value or performance of the investments we manage. We attempt to mitigate known risks, but we can provide no assurance that our efforts will be successful. Our business and the businesses of the companies in which we invest are materially affected by financial markets and economic conditions or events throughout the world, such as interest rates, availability of credit, inflation rates, economic uncertainty, and changes in laws. The turmoil in global financial markets has provoked significant volatility of securities prices and contraction in the availability of credit, which can adversely affect our business. Unfavorable market and economic conditions may reduce opportunities for our funds to make, exit, and realize value from their investments. Challenging market conditions may make it difficult for us to find suitable investments or secure financing on attractive terms. Our ability to raise capital for successor funds is impaired by poor performance of existing funds. During periods of difficult market conditions, companies in which we have invested may experience decreased revenues, financial losses, and increased funding costs, which could materially affect our operating results and cash flow. We may not be able to manage our exposure to these conditions effectively. Our liquidity requirements are significant and may be adversely affected by adverse market and economic conditions. We expect that our primary liquidity needs will consist of cash required to grow our business lines, fund capital commitments, service debt obligations, and pay cash operating expenses. Our ability to achieve benefits from tax basis increases and the payments under the tax receivable agreement will depend upon various factors, including the timing and amount of our future income. Our business operations may also be impacted by operational risks and data security breaches, which could disrupt our businesses and result in losses. We rely heavily on our financial, accounting, and other data processing systems, and any failure of these systems could lead to significant financial loss or reputational damage. We face various security threats, including cyber-security threats that could compromise our confidential information and disrupt our operations. Our organizational structure allows for the expansion into new investment strategies and geographic markets, which may result in additional risks and uncertainties. The complexity of our operations requires effective management and oversight to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and to mitigate risks associated with new investments. Our growth strategy is based on the expansion of our platform through selective investment in complementary businesses and strategies, which may introduce new market risks and operational challenges. We may also face challenges in managing conflicts of interest that arise among our various funds and investment activities. The performance of our funds and our ability to raise capital are significantly influenced by global economic conditions and market volatility, which can impact our investment strategies and overall business performance. The ability to adapt to these changing conditions is crucial for maintaining operational flexibility and achieving our major objectives.

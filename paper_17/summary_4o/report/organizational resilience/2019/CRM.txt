The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations, stockholders' equity, cash flows, and financial condition. These risks are mitigated, to the extent possible, by our ability to maintain and improve business and data governance policies, enhanced processes, and internal security controls, including our ability to escalate and respond to known and potential risks. Our board of directors, audit committee, and executive management are regularly briefed on our cybersecurity policies and practices and ongoing efforts to improve security. Although we have developed systems and processes designed to protect our customers' and our customers' customers' proprietary and other sensitive data, we can provide no assurances that such measures will provide absolute security. Our ability to mitigate these risks may be impacted by frequent changes to, and growth in complexity of, the techniques used to breach, obtain unauthorized access to, or sabotage IT systems and infrastructure, which are generally not recognized until launched against a target. We have from time to time experienced interruptions in our services, and such interruptions may occur in the future. In addition, the ongoing coronavirus epidemic could potentially disrupt the supply chain of hardware needed to maintain these third-party systems or to run our business. We currently serve our customers from third-party data center hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers located in the United States and other countries. Any disruption or damage to, or failure of our systems generally, including the systems of our third-party platform providers, could result in interruptions in our services. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, more variation from our forecasted expectations of new business activity due to longer and less predictable sales cycles and increasing complexity of our business, which includes an expanded mix of products and various revenue models resulting from acquisitions. Our corporate headquarters, and a significant portion of our research and development activities, IT systems, and other critical business operations, are located near major seismic faults in the San Francisco Bay Area. Because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses, significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. Our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, pandemics, and other events beyond our control. We have made and expect to continue to make additional investments in our infrastructure to scale our operations, increase productivity, and enhance our security measures. We plan to upgrade or replace various internal systems to scale with our overall growth. Our ability to manage our projected growth effectively will depend on the continued productivity of our existing employees and the hiring, training, and management of new employees as needed. Our success will depend in part upon our ability to maintain and enhance our brands, which is critical to expanding our base of customers, partners, and employees. We believe that maintaining and enhancing the salesforce brand and our other brands are critical to our organizational resilience.

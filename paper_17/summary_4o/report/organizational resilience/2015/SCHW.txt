The company faces a variety of risks that may affect its operations or financial results, driven by factors that it cannot control or predict. Developments in the business, economic, and geopolitical environment could negatively impact the company's business. The company's business can be adversely affected by the general environment, including economic, corporate, securities market, regulatory, and geopolitical developments, which all play a role in client asset valuations and trading activity. The company is subject to extensive regulation, which continues to grow more complex, affecting its activities and potentially imposing significant penalties. The requirements imposed by regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of financial markets and the safety of financial institutions, which affects the company's operations and imposes capital and client protection requirements. The company maintains systems and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but violations could occur, leading to fines, penalties, and reputational damage. The company is also exposed to operational risk, which includes potential loss due to inadequate or failed internal processes, systems, and external events impacting the company and its key business partners. This risk encompasses human error, execution errors, and external fraud, which could negatively impact the company's reputation and client confidence. Despite efforts to manage these risks, there can be no assurance that the company will not suffer unexpected losses due to operational failures or errors. The company is dependent on the integrity and performance of securities exchanges and other intermediaries, and disruptions in service could result in substantial losses. Maintaining adequate liquidity is crucial for the company's operations, and fluctuations in client cash or deposit balances may affect its ability to meet liquidity needs. The company conducts regular liquidity stress testing to ensure its ability to maintain sufficient liquidity during market-related or company-specific stress events. The company has established policies to support its business strategies while ensuring ongoing liquidity to meet operational needs and regulatory requirements. The company also monitors its subsidiaries' capital levels and requirements, ensuring that excess capital is transferred to support business growth. The company's risk management program is designed to identify and manage risks, with senior management actively involved in the process. The company has developed policies and procedures to manage operational risk, including maintaining backup and recovery functions and conducting periodic testing of disaster recovery plans. The company is committed to upgrading its technology systems to meet evolving client needs and regulatory changes. Despite these efforts, it is not always possible to prevent technological or operational failures, and the company may face litigation and regulatory actions as a result. The company also faces compliance risk, which includes the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, fines, or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with laws and regulations. The company's risk management framework incorporates its purpose, vision, and values, setting the tone for the organization and guiding its approach to managing risks encountered in its business activities.

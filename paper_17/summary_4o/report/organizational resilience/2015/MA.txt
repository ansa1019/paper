The global payments industry is subject to rapid and significant technological developments and changes, which may impact our business and require effective adaptation strategies to maintain operational continuity and resilience. Our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission, and storage of confidential information, necessitating a robust information security program and business continuity measures to mitigate risks associated with cyber threats and service disruptions. We maintain a business continuity program to analyze risk, assess potential impacts, and develop effective response strategies, although we cannot ensure immunity from these risks. The evolving nature of threats and the scale of our operations heighten our exposure, making the continued development and enhancement of our controls and processes a priority. Our ability to respond effectively to environmental disruptions and transform our operations is critical to emerging stronger from challenging situations. The regulatory landscape is increasingly complex, with potential obligations and restrictions that could materially impact our business and necessitate strategic responses to maintain competitive advantage. The need for operational flexibility and resource allocation is paramount, as limitations on our ability to restrict merchant surcharging could adversely affect our results of operations. The interconnectedness of global markets means that developments in one jurisdiction may influence regulatory approaches in others, creating a multifaceted environment that requires proactive measures to navigate. Our relationships with issuers and acquirers are essential for supporting our programs and services, and any deterioration in these relationships could adversely impact our organizational health and resilience. We are also exposed to risks from disintermediation within the payments value chain, as parties may seek to eliminate our intermediary role, thereby challenging our operational effectiveness. The competitive landscape is characterized by intense competition and pricing pressures, which may necessitate strategic initiatives to drive value for our customers and maintain our market position. The impact of external pressures, including economic conditions and regulatory scrutiny, underscores the importance of strategic foresight and adaptability in our operations. Our ability to absorb strain and preserve functioning despite adversity is critical for sustaining performance and achieving our major objectives. The dynamic capabilities of our organization, including our knowledge management practices and inter-organizational collaboration, enhance our resilience and ability to confront unexpected situations. The focus on service innovation and customer needs is integral to our strategy, as we seek to reconfigure our offerings to meet evolving market demands. The potential for operational disruptions due to external disturbances necessitates a comprehensive approach to risk management and emergency preparedness, ensuring that we can effectively respond to crises and maintain organizational coherence. The emphasis on organizational learning and the development of emotional resources within our teams supports our resilience strategies, enabling us to navigate complex situations and enhance our overall effectiveness in a turbulent business environment.

This annual report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements regarding our expectations and beliefs about future conduct and growth of the business, including our ability to adapt to technological change and successfully introduce new and enhanced products and services. We face intense competitive pressures that may harm our operating results, and we must continue to innovate and develop new products and features to meet changing customer needs. Our business operations, data centers, information technology, and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from various events beyond our control, including natural disasters and cyber attacks. We are investing significant resources in our information technology infrastructure and privacy and security capabilities to protect our customers from fraud and to enhance our operational resilience. Business interruption or failure of our information technology and communication systems may impair the availability of our products and services, which may damage our reputation and harm our future financial results. We have encountered difficulty in launching new products and services in the past, and if we misjudge customer needs, our new products may not succeed. Our future growth depends upon our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, enter new markets, and drive broad adoption of our products and services. We are also subject to various legal proceedings and regulatory inquiries that could result in an unfavorable outcome and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our financial results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to various factors, including changes in consumer behavior and the timing of revenue recognition. We are continually investing resources to update and improve our internal information technology systems and software platforms, and if we experience prolonged delays or unforeseen difficulties, we may experience outages that could disrupt our business operations. Our growth is dependent on the strength of our business relationships and our ability to continue to develop, maintain, and leverage new and existing relationships. We rely on various third-party partners to deliver our offerings and operate our business, and any interruption or failure of these systems may prevent us from fulfilling customer orders. We are also required to comply with a variety of laws and regulations that could impose significant limitations and require changes to our business. Our operations process a significant volume of transactions daily, and effective processing systems and controls are essential to ensure that transactions are handled appropriately. We have invested and expect to continue to invest in new business models, geographies, strategies, and initiatives, which may involve significant risks and uncertainties. Our ability to combat fraudulent activities is critical to maintaining customer confidence, and as these activities become more sophisticated, we may need to implement complex risk control mechanisms that could impact legitimate customers. Our business is subject to significant seasonality, and we expect this seasonality to continue to impact our quarterly financial results. We have also started to increasingly utilize third-party distribution platforms for our product offerings, which could adversely affect our financial results if the platform owners change their terms of service. Overall, our ability to maintain operational continuity and adapt to changing conditions is essential for our organizational resilience and long-term success.

Our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by various risks, including intense competition and rapid technological changes in the medical devices industry. We face pressures across many of our businesses due to competitive activity and increased market power of our customers as the healthcare industry consolidates, which may adversely impact market sizes and our share of the markets in which we compete. We are subject to a number of market, business, financial, legal, and regulatory risks and uncertainties with respect to our international operations that could have a material impact on our business. Our international operations are subject to various risks, including political and economic instability, competitive product offerings, and local changes in healthcare financing and delivery systems, which may adversely impact our ability to implement our growth strategy in these markets. We continue to experience pressures due to economic conditions and the impact of managed care organizations, which could lead to decreased demand for our products and services. The healthcare industry is undergoing substantial structural and financial changes that will continue to affect our results of operations, including government and private sector initiatives limiting the growth of healthcare costs and changes in payment policies. Our strategic initiatives include ongoing assessments of opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency to better align expenses with revenues, while preserving our ability to invest in research and development. We have undertaken various restructuring initiatives to enhance our growth potential and position us for long-term success, including the 2014 restructuring plan aimed at strengthening operational effectiveness and efficiency. We expect that these initiatives will support new growth investments and enhance our ability to respond to market dynamics. Our ability to manage our debt levels and maintain investment-grade credit ratings is critical to our financial health, as disruptions in cash flows could adversely affect our financial condition. We are committed to developing new products and enhancing existing products, which requires significant investment in research and development, clinical trials, and regulatory approvals. The success of our strategic acquisitions, investments, and alliances is intended to further expand our ability to offer effective medical devices that satisfy customer needs. We believe that our investment-grade credit profile reflects the size and diversity of our product portfolio, our leading share position in several markets, and our strong cash flow. Our operational flexibility is essential in navigating the complexities of the healthcare landscape, and we continuously monitor the dynamics of the economy and the healthcare industry to assess opportunities for growth. The introduction of cost containment incentives and closer scrutiny of healthcare expenditures has resulted in increased discounts and contractual adjustments, which may impact our ability to compete effectively. Our organizational practices emphasize the importance of maintaining operational continuity and adapting to changes in the regulatory environment, which is becoming increasingly stringent and unpredictable. The evolving regulatory landscape may increase the time, cost, and complexity of obtaining approvals for our products, impacting our ability to maintain or expand our market position.

The risks and uncertainties described could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, potentially causing actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services, decreasing our market share. We operate in highly competitive markets and compete based on customer service, price, store location, and quality. Intense competitive pressures or our inability to adapt effectively to a changing competitive landscape could affect our prices, margins, or demand for our products and services. If we cannot timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs, expectations, or trends, our relationship with customers, reputation, and market share could suffer. The success of our business depends on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends while managing appropriate inventory levels. Customer expectations are increasingly demanding, requiring us to continually anticipate and adapt to changes in the purchasing process. We have implemented various programs to enhance customer service, but we cannot guarantee their success in meeting customer needs. Our aging store base requires maintenance and space reallocation initiatives to deliver the desired shopping environment. Failure to maintain our stores and utilize space effectively could adversely affect our reputation and demand for our products. Our ability to attract, develop, and retain qualified associates is crucial, as customers expect a high level of service and product knowledge. An inability to provide competitive wages and benefits could adversely affect employee retention. We have incurred significant expenses related to a data breach, which could adversely impact our operations, financial results, and reputation. The breach involved unauthorized access to our systems, leading to substantial costs and ongoing investigations. Our information systems are vulnerable to cybersecurity risks, and we must continually evaluate and adapt our systems to safeguard against breaches. Any future significant compromise of our data security could result in additional costs and reputational damage. We face various payment-related risks that could disrupt our business and increase operating costs. Uncertainty regarding the housing market and economic conditions could adversely affect demand for our products and services. A failure of key information technology systems could disrupt our operations, as we rely extensively on these systems for transaction management. Disruptions in our supply chain could impair our ability to deliver inventory timely, resulting in lost sales and damage to our reputation. The implementation of supply chain and technology initiatives could disrupt operations in the near term and may not provide anticipated benefits. Our ability to manage and expand relationships with suppliers is essential for executing our product differentiation strategy. If we fail to manage these relationships effectively, it could adversely impact our sales and gross margin results. We must also navigate the challenges of international markets, which present unique risks that could impact our operations and profitability. Changes in laws and regulations could increase our costs of doing business. Our organizational resilience is tested by various external pressures, including market volatility, regulatory changes, and competitive dynamics, requiring us to maintain operational flexibility and strategic foresight to adapt and thrive in challenging conditions.

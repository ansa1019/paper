Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk, and we have identified various risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business and future prospects. Our revenue growth rate is expected to continue to decline, and we anticipate incurring losses due to increased costs associated with our capacity investments. Unforeseen operating expenses and difficulties may arise, impacting our ability to maintain profitability. The introduction of products in new markets, where we lack operating history, is critical for our growth prospects. Our successful entry into these markets depends on various factors, including product differentiation and effective marketing strategies. We may not possess the necessary resources or expertise to compete effectively, which could adversely affect our revenue growth rate and operating results. Competition in the market segments we operate is intense and may lead to pricing pressures, impacting our financial results. Additionally, we face risks related to our international operations, including regulatory and economic challenges that differ from those in the United States. Our substantial investments in data centers and cloud computing infrastructure are essential for our growth, yet the success of these investments is uncertain. We may encounter difficulties in hiring qualified personnel for our sales and marketing efforts, which could hinder our ability to expand our customer base. Our business relies heavily on existing customers renewing their subscriptions and purchasing additional services, and any decline in these areas could harm our operating results. We depend on channel partners for revenue growth, and any failure to establish or maintain these relationships may impair our ability to compete effectively. Changes in laws and regulations related to data privacy and cloud computing may also impact our operations. Our sales cycles are lengthy and variable, particularly when targeting large enterprise customers, which may lead to unpredictability in our revenue generation. Natural disasters and other events beyond our control could disrupt our operations and negatively affect our ability to deliver services. We continuously enhance our products and services to meet customer expectations, and failure to do so may render our offerings less competitive. Our financial performance is subject to fluctuations due to various factors, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and economic conditions affecting our customers. The complexity of our operations and the need for effective risk management strategies are critical for maintaining organizational resilience. Our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and customer needs is essential for sustaining growth and achieving our major objectives. We must also navigate the challenges posed by competitive pressures and the need for operational flexibility to respond to unexpected situations. The ongoing evaluation of our internal capabilities and external pressures will be crucial in ensuring our organizational health and long-term success.

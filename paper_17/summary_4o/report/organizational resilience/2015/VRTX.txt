Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk, and you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below. Our business and future revenues depend heavily on our ability to successfully commercialize our products. If we are unable to do so, our business will be materially harmed. Our ability to successfully commercialize our products is dependent on various factors, including the rate at which patients initiate treatment, the proportion of initiated patients who remain on treatment, and compliance rates. We believe that a significant portion of the value attributed to our company by investors is based on the commercial potential of our products. Our future success also depends on our ability to expand the number of patients who are eligible for treatment. The introduction or greater acceptance of competing products, changes in reimbursement policies, or adverse legal developments could impair our ability to commercialize our products. We have a history of incurring losses, and our future revenues will depend on our ability to successfully commercialize our products and control our costs to counter unforeseen difficulties. Our ability to achieve and sustain profitability depends on our capacity to increase revenue and manage costs effectively. We face significant competition from other companies, including larger pharmaceutical firms with greater resources. Our success in rapidly developing and commercializing our products may increase the resources that our competitors allocate to their development efforts. If we discover safety issues with any of our products, commercialization efforts could be negatively affected. Our products are subject to ongoing regulatory oversight, and if we fail to comply with applicable laws, our business could be materially harmed. We maintain a corporate compliance program designed to identify, prevent, and mitigate risks. Our marketing of pharmaceutical products is subject to extensive laws and regulations, and we expect to devote substantial resources to maintain compliance. Our revenues are dependent on the extent to which our products are covered by third-party payors. We are engaged in discussions with various insurers and government health programs to ensure appropriate reimbursement levels. The trend in the healthcare industry is cost containment, which may adversely affect our ability to establish or maintain appropriate prices for our products. Our international operations expose us to risks associated with differing regulatory requirements, economic instability, and compliance with local laws. We rely on third-party manufacturers for our products, and any disruptions in supply could adversely affect our business. Our operations are also subject to risks related to product liability claims, and we maintain insurance to cover these risks. We depend on skilled employees for our operations, and competition for qualified personnel is intense. Our ability to manage operations effectively is critical, and we must enhance our operational and financial infrastructure to support our growth. We have adopted a business continuity plan to address potential disruptions, but if we are unable to implement these plans fully, we may experience significant operational challenges. Our future cash flows will be substantially dependent on product sales, and we may need to raise additional capital to fund our operations. We expect to continue investing in our research programs to develop transformative medicines, balancing risks inherent in drug development. Our collaborative agreements may involve significant judgments and estimates that impact our financial statements. We continuously monitor our research and development programs and adjust our strategies based on new data and insights.

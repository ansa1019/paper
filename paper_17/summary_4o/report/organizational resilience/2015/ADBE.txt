Our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include our ability to anticipate customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends, as well as our capacity to adapt our products to new platforms. If we fail to extend our core technologies into new applications or respond effectively to technological changes, our competitive position could be weakened. We maintain strategic relationships with third parties to market certain products and services, and any failure in these relationships could impair our ability to compete and grow revenue. The markets for our products are characterized by intense competition and disruptive technology developments, which could create downward pressure on pricing and adversely affect our renewal and upgrade rates. Our future success will depend on our ability to enhance existing products and introduce new offerings on a timely basis while meeting changing customer needs. We must also effectively manage transitions to new business models and markets, as any failure in this regard could harm our results of operations. Our cloud strategy requires continued investment in product development and may give rise to risks, including customer concerns regarding service availability and information security. If we are unable to respond to these threats, our business could be harmed. We devote significant resources to the development of technologies in markets where our operating history is less extensive, and these new offerings may require considerable investment of technical and financial resources. Our ability to successfully establish new offerings in light of the competitive environment is critical. We face risks associated with compliance with laws and regulations globally, which may harm our business. As a global company, we are subject to varied and complex laws, regulations, and customs. Compliance with these laws may involve significant costs or require changes in our business practices that could result in reduced revenue. We are increasingly subject to risks arising from adverse changes in economic and political conditions, both domestically and globally. Uncertainty about current and future economic conditions makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and make decisions about future investments. Deterioration in economic conditions could cause slower or impaired collections on accounts receivable, adversely impacting our liquidity and financial condition. We are also exposed to risks associated with our operating as a multinational corporation, including foreign currency fluctuations and changes in government preferences for software procurement. Our business relies on our network infrastructure and enterprise applications, and any disruption or failure of these systems could negatively impact our ability to conduct normal business operations. Climate change may have a long-term impact on our business, as access to clean water and reliable energy is a priority. A natural disaster could disrupt business operations, leading to losses and added costs to resume operations. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash outlays. Our investment portfolio may become impaired by deterioration of the financial markets, and we follow established guidelines to monitor and mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk. We also face various risks associated with our ability to recruit and retain key personnel, which is critical for our long-term success. Our corporate culture, which fosters innovation and teamwork, is a key contributor to our success, and maintaining this culture is essential as we grow.

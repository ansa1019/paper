The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, other key metrics, and the trading price of our common stock. Our ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity is critical. We face operational and execution risks, including breaches in security measures, defects or disruptions in our services, interruptions or delays from third parties, and strain on our personnel resources from supporting our existing and growing customer base. Our dependency on the development and maintenance of the internet's infrastructure by third parties exposes us to risks inherent in international operations. We may experience customer attrition or an inability to accurately predict subscription renewals and upgrade rates, which could impact our operational flexibility. Disruptions caused by changes to our sales organization may also affect our performance under pressure. 

Our strategic and industry risks include an inability to compete effectively in intensely competitive markets and the potential loss of invested capital. We must maintain and enhance our brands while navigating social and ethical issues, including the use of AI in our offerings. Legal and regulatory risks, such as evolving regulations of cloud computing and privacy concerns, may limit the use and adoption of our services. Financial risks include downturns in new business, significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth, and unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate. 

We are subject to volatile and significantly weakened global economic conditions, which can adversely affect our business and results of operations. Natural disasters and other events beyond our control may disrupt our operations and impact our ability to deliver services. The long-term impact of climate change poses additional risks, as our corporate headquarters and critical business operations are located in areas vulnerable to such events. 

Our restructuring plan, intended to reduce operating costs and improve operating margins, included a reduction of our workforce and office space reductions. We continue to evaluate and operationalize future programs to further our transformational efforts. Our ability to scale operations and increase productivity is essential for executing our business plan. We must continue to improve our operational, financial, and management controls, as well as our reporting systems and procedures. 

Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel. Changes in our management team may disrupt our business, and effective succession planning is important for long-term success. Our corporate culture, which fosters collaboration and a sense of family, may be challenged as we grow and expand globally. We must also manage the complexities of communicating with all employees. 

In summary, our organizational resilience is tested by various internal and external pressures, and our ability to adapt to these challenges will significantly impact our operational effectiveness and long-term success.

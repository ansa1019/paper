Our business, results of operations, and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including intense competitive pressures that could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services. We face competition from various retailers and service providers, which requires us to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape. Our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics and shifts in consumer preferences is critical for maintaining customer relationships and market share. Disruptions in our logistics or supply chain network, such as those experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected our ability to meet customer demand and may result in lost sales and increased supply chain costs. Our interconnected retail strategy requires continual investment in operations and information technology systems, and any failure to effectively manage these investments could disrupt our operations and impact our financial performance. We must also attract, develop, and retain highly qualified associates to provide excellent customer service and support our strategic initiatives while controlling labor costs. The ability to manage leadership transitions successfully is critical to our business success, as is our capacity to maintain a safe and secure store environment. Our reliance on information technology systems exposes us to risks, including potential failures that could significantly disrupt our operations. We are also subject to various external factors, including economic conditions and public health issues, which could adversely affect demand for our products and services. Our operational flexibility is essential in responding to these external pressures and maintaining organizational health. The execution of our interconnected retail strategy involves managing complex relationships with suppliers and ensuring compliance with various regulations, which can impact our operational effectiveness. We must continually evaluate and adapt our systems and processes to safeguard against cybersecurity threats and data privacy risks. Our ability to maintain a high level of product and service quality is vital for customer confidence and brand reputation. The changing regulatory environment related to data privacy and cybersecurity requires significant effort and cost, impacting our ability to collect and use data effectively. We are also exposed to risks associated with international operations, including geopolitical conflicts and trade policy changes, which could adversely affect our sales and profitability. The long-term impacts of climate change and extreme weather conditions may disrupt our supply chain and affect our ability to procure goods. Our strategic transactions, including mergers and acquisitions, involve risks that could affect our financial condition and results of operations. We must effectively manage our installation services business to avoid reputational damage and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. Our financial performance depends significantly on the stability of the housing and home improvement markets, and adverse conditions could lead to decreased consumer spending. The ability to foresee and adapt to these challenges is crucial for our organizational resilience and long-term success.

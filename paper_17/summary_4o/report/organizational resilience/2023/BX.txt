Difficult market, economic, and geopolitical conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways, which could materially reduce our revenue, earnings, and cash flow. In the face of a difficult market or economic environment, we may need to reduce our fixed costs and other expenses to maintain profitability, including cutting back or eliminating the use of certain services or service providers. A failure to manage or reduce our costs and other expenses within a time frame sufficient to match any decrease in profitability would adversely affect our operating performance. Turmoil in the global financial markets can provoke significant volatility, impacting our mark-to-market valuations, particularly with respect to our public holdings and credit investments. An extended period of high interest rates would continue to present challenges to valuations. Economic deceleration or contraction may contribute to poor financial results for our funds' portfolio companies or assets, resulting in lower investment returns. In addition, negative market conditions could potentially result in a portfolio company entering bankruptcy proceedings, leading to a complete loss of the fund's investment and a significant negative impact on performance and cash flow. During periods of weakness, our funds' portfolio companies may also have difficulty expanding their businesses or meeting their debt service obligations. The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and geopolitical instability have contributed to volatility in the global financial markets, which may adversely impact our performance. A period of economic slowdown creates operating performance challenges for certain investments, which could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows. Despite overall resilience in some geographies, many global economies have experienced periods of deceleration. The ability to foresee and confront sudden disruptive changes is critical for survival and growth. Our business initiatives to increase the number and type of investment products expose us to new risks, including heightened litigation and regulatory enforcement. We must maintain a work environment that reinforces our culture of collaboration and alignment of interests with investors, as failure to do so could impair our ability to compete successfully. We depend on our key personnel, and the loss of their services would have a material adverse effect on our business. The significant voting power of certain stockholders may limit the ability of common stockholders to influence our business. Our organizational structure and governance may also create potential conflicts of interest that could adversely affect our operations. We are subject to extensive regulation, and the possibility of increased regulatory focus could result in additional burdens on our business. The financial services industry continues to face heightened scrutiny, which may adversely affect our ability to raise future investment funds. Our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and to manage risks effectively is essential for maintaining operational flexibility and achieving competitive advantage. The management of our investment funds requires significant judgment, and our ability to achieve attractive rates of return depends on our capacity to navigate complex situations and external pressures. We are reliant on third-party service providers for certain aspects of our business, and disruptions to these services could adversely impact our operations. Our funds' performance is also subject to the risks associated with environmental, social, and governance factors, which are increasingly scrutinized by investors and regulators.

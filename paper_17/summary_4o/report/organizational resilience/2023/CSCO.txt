Our operating results may fluctuate in future periods, which may adversely affect our stock price. These fluctuations are subject to numerous factors, including changes in demand for our products and services, particularly due to external pressures such as economic conditions. The global macroeconomic environment continues to be challenging and inconsistent, which may impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. We have experienced periods of time during which shipments have exceeded net bookings or manufacturing issues have delayed shipments, leading to nonlinearity in shipping patterns. Such nonlinearity can increase costs, resulting in periods of underutilized capacity and potential additional inventory management-related costs. We have taken multiple actions to mitigate component shortages and address supply constraints seen industry-wide. These actions included partnering with key suppliers and optimizing our inventory build and customer delivery plans. Our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels and purchase commitments is critical for operational flexibility and business continuity. Additionally, the transformation of our business to deliver more software and subscription offerings, where revenue is recognized over time, reflects our adaptability to changing market conditions. The introduction and market acceptance of new technologies and products, as well as our success in new and evolving markets, are essential for maintaining competitive advantage. Our strategic initiatives focus on accelerating innovation across our portfolio, which is necessary for recovery and performance maintenance in a challenging environment. We continue to operate in a highly competitive environment, and our ability to execute on our strategy and operating plans is crucial for achieving targeted cost reductions and benefits from our investments. The ongoing geopolitical tensions and economic challenges may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions, impacting our operational resources and overall performance. We have also seen a broad-based weakening in the global macroeconomic environment, which has historically impacted certain of our markets. Our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict, especially in light of a challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment. We have experienced declines in product demand due to customers absorbing recently shipped products and adjusting to significant reductions in product lead times. Our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers and contract manufacturers. We are exposed to fluctuations in market values and interest rates, which could negatively impact our financial results. Our business and operations are subject to the risks of natural catastrophic events, including earthquakes and floods, which could disrupt our supply chain and delivery of products. The continued threat of terrorism and heightened security measures may also create further uncertainties that could negatively impact our business. In response to these challenges, we have initiated a restructuring plan to rebalance the organization and enable further investment in key priority areas. Our future results could be materially adversely affected by various political, economic, or other factors relating to our operations inside and outside the United States. We must manage our strategic alliances effectively to realize the expected benefits and mitigate risks associated with competition and operational disruptions.

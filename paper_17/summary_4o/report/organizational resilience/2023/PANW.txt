Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including unfavorable economic and market conditions, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. The growth and expansion of our business and product offerings place significant strain on our management, operational, and financial resources, necessitating effective management of future growth to avoid material disruptions. We must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, operating and administrative systems, and controls to manage headcount, capital, and processes efficiently. Our ability to navigate challenges, including fluctuations in revenue and operational performance, is critical to maintaining organizational resilience. We rely on revenue from subscription and support offerings, which account for a significant portion of our revenue, and any downturns in sales or renewals could negatively impact our financial results. Our operating results may vary significantly from period to period, making it difficult to predict future performance, and we must manage the complexities associated with our growth effectively. We face intense competition in our market, and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position is crucial for organizational health. The enterprise security industry is characterized by rapidly changing technologies and business plans, requiring us to adapt and innovate continually. Our investments in research and development are essential to meet evolving customer needs and improve our competitive position. We must effectively anticipate and respond to technological developments and market changes to sustain our growth and ensure operational continuity. Our reliance on channel partners for sales and distribution introduces additional risks, as their performance directly impacts our ability to sell and distribute products. We are also exposed to credit and liquidity risks from our customers, which could result in material losses, particularly in weakened markets. The geopolitical environment and economic conditions, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, may further exacerbate these risks and impact our operational flexibility. Our reputation and business could be negatively impacted by environmental, social, and governance matters, emphasizing the need for effective crisis management and resilience strategies. The complexity of our operations requires effective coordination across departments, and any failure to manage these complexities could materially harm our business performance. Our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key personnel is vital for sustaining organizational resilience, and we must foster a corporate culture that supports innovation and knowledge sharing. As we expand our international operations, we face additional risks associated with compliance and regulatory requirements, which could limit our ability to compete effectively in global markets. Our future success depends on our ability to manage these risks and uncertainties while continuing to deliver value to our end-customers and stakeholders.

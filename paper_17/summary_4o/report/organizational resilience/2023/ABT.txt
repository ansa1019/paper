Abbott's operations and performance depend on its ability to manage its large and complex global supply chain, which is susceptible to disruptions that could negatively affect results of operations. While Abbott has taken and will continue to take actions to mitigate the risks of disruptions to its global supply chain, the COVID-19 pandemic and macroeconomic conditions such as inflationary pressures and labor shortages have contributed to global supply chain challenges, adversely impacting the cost and availability of certain raw materials, supplies, and services. Abbott invests in its information systems and technology to reduce the risk of a cybersecurity incident or other significant disruption, monitoring these systems on an ongoing basis for potential threats or vulnerabilities. However, there can be no assurance that these measures will prevent future incidents or disruptions. Abbott's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause revenue and profitability to decline. The company must continue to launch new products and technologies to remain competitive, committing substantial efforts, funds, and resources to research and development, with a risk of failure inherent in this process. Problems may arise during manufacturing for various reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow protocols, and supply chain issues, which could lead to increased costs, lost revenue, and reputational damage. Abbott's significant indebtedness could adversely affect its business, reducing flexibility to respond to changing conditions and decreasing funds available for working capital and other purposes. Legal and regulatory compliance is costly, and consequences for non-compliance could materially affect revenues and profitability. Abbott's industry is subject to various laws and regulations that may impose new obligations or require changes in business practices, potentially disrupting operations. The company is also subject to risks related to public health crises, such as widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases, which may negatively impact operations and demand for certain products. Abbott has experienced significant reductions in demand for products during the pandemic, but overall volume trends improved in several businesses as conditions stabilized. The company has taken various actions to mitigate the impact of challenges, including strategic acquisitions and investments in product development to enhance its portfolio. Future planning involves focusing on growth opportunities and enhancing operational capabilities to adapt to changing market conditions. Abbott's ability to manage these disruptions without significant impact on operations reflects its resilience strategies and operational flexibility. The company continues to monitor economic, geopolitical, and industry risks that could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations, including changes in tax laws, regulatory environments, and competitive landscapes.

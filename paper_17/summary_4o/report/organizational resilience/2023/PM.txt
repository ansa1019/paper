The organizationâ€™s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity is critical. We recognize that our business continuity plans and other safeguards might not always be effective to fully mitigate the impact of various risks, including geopolitical disruptions and environmental issues. The impact of geopolitical disruptions resulting from the conflict in Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic created significant societal and economic disruption, including supply chain disruptions and operational challenges. Our operations are continuously assessed to adapt to unexpected situations and external pressures, which may include regulatory constraints and market volatility. We face significant governmental action aimed at increasing regulatory requirements, which could materially affect our business and operational flexibility. The evolving situation in Russia and Ukraine has necessitated a continuous assessment of our operational capabilities, including the need to develop contingency plans to address disruptions. We are committed to maintaining our operational continuity and adapting our strategies to ensure resilience in the face of these challenges. The integration of Swedish Match into our existing operations is expected to enhance our organizational strength and ability to respond to market demands. Our strategic initiatives focus on developing reduced-risk products that present less risk of harm to adult smokers, which requires effective resource allocation and innovation. The competitive landscape necessitates a multifaceted approach to resilience, including the ability to foresee and confront disruptive changes. Our ability to attract and retain talent is crucial for achieving our strategic goals, particularly as we transform into a consumer-centric business. We recognize the importance of inter-organizational collaboration and the need for effective stakeholder engagement to enhance our organizational capabilities. The potential for product recalls and the impact of litigation related to tobacco use could adversely affect our reputation and operational performance. We are aware that the financial and business performance of our reduced-risk products is less predictable than our traditional cigarette business, which requires us to remain agile and responsive to changing market conditions. The effects of climate change and environmental issues may disrupt our supply chain and operational management, necessitating proactive measures to mitigate these risks. Our strategic response includes investing in innovative smoke-free products and expanding our portfolio to include wellness and healthcare offerings. We continuously monitor our long-lived assets and assess the potential for impairment, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position. The challenges posed by inflation and regulatory changes may impact our profitability and necessitate adjustments in our operational strategies. Our commitment to sustainability and adaptability is reflected in our efforts to align with environmental goals while managing the complexities of our global operations. We acknowledge that the landscape of our business is influenced by various external disturbances, and we strive to maintain our organizational effectiveness and resilience through strategic foresight and operational flexibility.

The organization’s ability to absorb strain and preserve or improve functioning despite the presence of adversity is critical to its resilience. We continue to work to improve our transportation plan, add capacity, and enhance our operational flexibility to address surges in demand. Although we cannot be sure that these measures will fully address service shortcomings, our focus on operational excellence and resource allocation aims to mitigate risks associated with fluctuating demand and network capacity. We face significant risks from severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena, which have historically impacted our operational efficiency and could adversely affect our financial condition. Our reliance on technology and improvements in our business operations is essential, as insufficient capital deployment for technology upgrades may lead to competitive disadvantages. Cybersecurity risks present additional challenges, as incidents could result in significant service interruptions and operational difficulties. We are also subject to various external pressures, including governmental regulation and potential disruptions in trade, which could materially affect our operations and financial performance. Our workforce management strategies are crucial for maintaining service reliability, as labor disputes and shortages can compromise our operational capabilities. The availability of qualified personnel is impacted by demographic changes and external factors, which may restrict our ability to attract and retain employees. We continuously evaluate our financial condition and liquidity to ensure we can sustain operations during periods of lower volumes, indicating our preparedness for unexpected situations. Our capital plan includes investments aimed at improving the safety and resiliency of our network, which is vital for maintaining operational continuity. We utilize climate scenario analyses to understand climate-related risks and opportunities, and our initiatives to reduce operational impacts align with our long-term resilience strategies. The organization’s ability to foresee and confront disruptive changes is reflected in our proactive measures to enhance our operational management and strategic adaptation. We recognize that macroeconomic uncertainties could impact our financial and operating results, and we remain committed to delivering the service we sold to our customers while effectively utilizing our resources. Our focus on improving network fluidity and operational efficiency is fundamental to our resilience in a turbulent market environment. The ongoing assessment of risks and the implementation of strategic initiatives are essential for sustaining organizational health and achieving our major objectives. As we navigate complex situations, our organizational capabilities and collaborative networks will play a significant role in our ability to adapt and thrive amidst adversity.

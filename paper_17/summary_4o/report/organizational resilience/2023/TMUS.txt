Our business involves the receipt, storage, and transmission of confidential information about our customers, and we are subject to persistent cyberattacks and threats from various bad actors attempting to gain unauthorized access to and compromise this information. The methods used to gain unauthorized access are constantly evolving, making it increasingly difficult to anticipate, prevent, and detect incidents successfully. We routinely rely upon third-party providers whose products and services are used in our business, and these providers face their own security challenges, which could adversely affect our operations. Our procedures and safeguards to prevent unauthorized access to confidential information and to defend against cyberattacks must be continually evaluated and enhanced to address the ever-evolving threat landscape. The investment of significant resources and management time is required to enhance our cybersecurity measures. We expect to continue being targeted by cyberattacks, which necessitates a robust approach to risk management and operational resilience. System failures and business disruptions may prevent us from providing reliable service, which could materially adversely affect our reputation and financial condition. We rely upon systems and networks, including those of third-party suppliers, to provide and support our service offerings. Physical damage, power surges, equipment failure, or other service disruptions, including those resulting from severe weather and natural disasters, may occur more frequently or with greater intensity due to global climate change. Such events could cause us to lose customers and revenue, incur expenses, suffer reputational damage, and subject us to fines, penalties, adverse actions, or judgments. Our insurance may not cover or may not be adequate to fully reimburse us for costs and losses associated with such events. The challenges in satisfying government commitments and the significant cumulative costs incurred in tracking, monitoring, and complying with them could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and operating results. Our ability to adapt to changes in available technology, including artificial intelligence and machine learning, is essential for maintaining competitive advantage and operational flexibility. We must continually invest in our network, enhance our service offerings, and introduce new offerings to meet our customers' changing demands. Our future success depends on our ability to recruit, hire, motivate, develop, and retain talented personnel, as our workforce is critical to our operational resilience. Employee compensation and benefit costs may increase due to inflationary pressures, and if our compensation does not keep pace, we may see increased employee dissatisfaction and departures. The integration of our network and the realization of synergies from the merger with Sprint require effective resource allocation and management to ensure operational continuity. We are committed to enhancing our organizational capabilities and resilience strategies to navigate external pressures and maintain performance under challenging conditions. Our approach to crisis management and preparedness is vital for ensuring organizational health and adaptability in the face of disruptive events. The complexities of managing our diverse supplier relationships and the associated risks necessitate a proactive stance on resource management and operational resilience to mitigate potential impacts on our business continuity.

The company faces a variety of risks that may affect its operations or financial results, driven by factors beyond its control. Developments in the business, economic, and geopolitical environment could negatively impact the company's business, and deterioration in the housing and credit markets, reductions in short-term interest rates, and decreases in securities valuations could adversely affect results of operations and capital resources. The company maintains systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but violations could occur, potentially harming the company's reputation and adversely affecting financial condition. The company is subject to extensive regulation, which could limit activities and impose significant penalties. Financial reforms and related regulations may affect business activities, financial position, and profitability, requiring the company to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and implement necessary changes. The company faces operational risk, which includes the potential for loss due to inadequate or failed internal processes, systems, and external events impacting key business partners and vendors. This risk encompasses human error, execution errors, and external fraud, which could negatively impact the company's reputation and client confidence. The company has established policies and procedures to manage operational risks, including maintaining backup and recovery functions and conducting periodic testing of disaster recovery plans. Despite these efforts, unexpected losses, reputational damage, or regulatory action due to operational failures may still occur. The company is also dependent on the integrity and performance of securities exchanges and other intermediaries, where systems failures could result in delays and erroneous execution prices, causing substantial losses. Maintaining adequate liquidity is crucial, as fluctuations in client cash or deposit balances may affect the ability to meet liquidity needs. A significant decrease in liquidity could reduce client confidence and lead to the loss of client accounts. The company has policies to manage credit risk, including establishing and reviewing credit limits and monitoring the quality of counterparties. The company's exposure to credit risk is actively managed through individual and portfolio reviews, and the methodology for establishing an allowance for loan losses considers current economic conditions and risks inherent in the portfolio. The company also faces compliance risks, which could result in legal or regulatory sanctions, fines, or penalties due to failure to comply with laws and regulations. The company attempts to manage compliance risk through policies, procedures, and controls designed to achieve and monitor compliance. Despite these measures, legal breaches and rule violations could result in reputational harm and significant losses. The capital plan considers significant risks to meeting capital goals over time and through evolving economic and business environments, with a comprehensive capital contingency plan developed to address potential capital events. The company is committed to ongoing upgrades and enhancements to technology systems to meet client needs and regulatory changes, which is essential for maintaining operational resilience.

The risks described could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We are highly dependent on the financial performance of our U.S. and Canadian operations, which comprised 87% and 83% of consolidated net sales and operating income in 2014, respectively. Declines in financial performance could arise from negative trends in operating expenses, failing to meet targets for warehouse openings, and shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products. We may be unsuccessful in implementing our growth strategy, including expanding our business in existing and new markets, which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition. Disruptions in our depot operations could adversely affect sales and member satisfaction, as unforeseen disruptions due to catastrophic events may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise. We rely extensively on computer systems to manage our business, and any material interruption in these systems could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our investments in technology are essential for maintaining operational continuity and adapting to changing market conditions. Failure to maintain the privacy and security of member-related information could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operations. We face strong competition from other retailers, which could adversely affect our market share and financial results. General economic factors, including inflation and changes in consumer confidence, could adversely affect demand for our products and services. Natural disasters could negatively affect our operations and financial performance, potentially resulting in physical damage to properties and disruption in the supply of products. We must adapt to climate change and its associated risks, including increased compliance costs and operational disruptions. Our financial performance depends heavily on our ability to control costs, including labor and benefit costs, which are subject to numerous external factors. Our ability to attract, train, and retain highly qualified employees is crucial for maintaining organizational effectiveness and achieving our strategic objectives. We must also effectively manage our relationships with vendors to ensure the timely supply of quality merchandise. Our ability to foresee and respond to consumer trends is vital for maintaining member loyalty and market share. The risks associated with entering new markets include difficulties in attracting members and competition with established players. We must continuously monitor and adapt our strategies to maintain a competitive advantage in a rapidly evolving retail landscape. Our organizational resilience is tested by various external pressures, including economic fluctuations and competitive dynamics, which require us to be agile and responsive in our operations. We are committed to maintaining high standards for product safety and quality, as any failures in this area could lead to reputational damage and financial liabilities. Our focus on member satisfaction and loyalty is critical for sustaining our business model and achieving long-term profitability.

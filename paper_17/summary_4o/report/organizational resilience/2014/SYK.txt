This report contains statements referring to us that are not historical facts and are considered "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations. The impact of United States healthcare reform legislation on our business remains uncertain, and we expect the law will have a significant impact upon various aspects of our business operations. We may be adversely affected by product liability claims, unfavorable court decisions, or legal settlements, which expose us to potential product liability risks inherent in the design, manufacture, and marketing of medical devices. Our business is characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation, and we may incur significant expenses or be prevented from selling certain products due to infringement claims. Our long-term success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products, and failure to obtain or maintain adequate intellectual property protection could allow others to sell competing products. We are subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to the manufacturing, labeling, and marketing of our products, and failure to comply with these requirements may result in sanctions, including product recalls and monetary fines. Macroeconomic developments could negatively affect our ability to conduct business in affected regions, and financial difficulties experienced by our customers could result in product delays and inventory issues. Our operations are exposed to risks associated with changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, and political and economic instability in international markets. We may be unable to capitalize on previous or future acquisitions, as investments in medical technology are inherently risky, and integration activities may require more resources than anticipated. We rely extensively on information technology systems to conduct business, and failure of a key information technology system could have a material adverse impact on our business. We have made investments to address cybersecurity threats, but challenges in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures remain. Our ability to attract and retain key employees is crucial for meeting our strategic business objectives, and if we are unable to recruit and retain a talented workforce, our operational effectiveness may be compromised. We believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations. Our operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures, and we anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs, including settlements related to product recalls, from various sources. We continually evaluate our receivables, particularly in economically strained regions, and believe that our current reserves related to receivables are adequate. The ultimate cost to resolve product recalls may be materially different than current estimates, which could adversely affect our financial position. We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments, and changes in tax legislation or economic conditions could impact our effective tax rate and financial results.

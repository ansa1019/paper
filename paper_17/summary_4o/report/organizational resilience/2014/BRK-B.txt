Berkshire and its subsidiaries are subject to certain risks and uncertainties in their business operations. The company is dependent on a few key people for major investment and capital allocation decisions, and if the services of key personnel were to become unavailable, there could be a material adverse effect on operations. The board of directors has identified certain subsidiary managers capable of succeeding key personnel, and the succession plan, along with outstanding managers running diversified operating units, helps mitigate this risk. The decentralized business model necessitates qualified personnel to manage and operate various businesses, and changes in demographics or unavailability of qualified personnel could negatively impact the ability to meet customer demands. The operating businesses are subject to normal economic cycles, and deterioration of general economic conditions may significantly reduce operating earnings and impair access to capital markets. The company faces intense competitive pressures, and while it aims for long-term sustainable growth by developing competitive advantages, market and technology changes may erode these advantages. Regulatory changes may adversely impact future operating results, and increased compliance costs could negatively affect operating businesses. Cybersecurity risks are prevalent, and significant disruptions could lead to operational difficulties, including service interruptions and regulatory compliance failures. Although steps have been taken to mitigate these risks through business continuity planning and disaster recovery planning, a significant disruption could adversely affect results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. The company recognizes the importance of maintaining extraordinary capital strength, which creates opportunities in reinsurance activities and allows for negotiation of contracts tailored to meet unique needs. The insurance businesses have generated after-tax earnings from underwriting, but periodic earnings are significantly impacted by catastrophe loss events. The timing and magnitude of such losses can produce volatility in underwriting results. The company’s railroad business has been affected by service-related challenges, and it continues to work on improving operational performance. The utilities and energy businesses require significant capital investments to meet customer needs and reliability criteria. The company’s financial condition reflects significant liquidity and a strong capital base, with cash and investments approximating $217.2 billion. The board's commitment to maintaining financial strength and redundant liquidity is paramount, and the company regularly accesses credit markets, which could be adversely affected by restricted access to capital. The company’s approach to risk management encompasses various operational and financial strategies to ensure resilience in the face of external pressures and disruptive events, thereby supporting its long-term objectives and operational continuity.

In the course of conducting our business operations, we are exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are inherent in the financial services industry and others that are more specific to our own businesses. Our businesses and results of operations are affected by the financial markets and general economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad, including factors such as the level and volatility of short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, and household income. The current environment of heightened scrutiny of financial institutions has resulted in increased public awareness of and sensitivity to banking fees and practices. Our businesses and results of operations may be adversely affected by the U.S. and international financial markets, fiscal and monetary policy, and economic conditions generally. Despite improving labor markets, an elevated level of under-employment and household debt poses risks to the financial services industry. We rely on certain secured funding sources, such as repo markets, which are typically short-term and credit-sensitive in nature. Our liquidity could be adversely affected by any inability to access the capital markets, unforeseen outflows of cash, or negative perceptions about our business prospects. We are subject to extensive government legislation and regulations, which impact our operating costs and could require us to make changes to our operations. Our risk management framework is designed to minimize risk and loss, and we seek to identify, measure, monitor, report, and control our exposure to the types of risk to which we are subject. Our risk management processes include identifying risks, measuring them, monitoring adherence to risk appetites, and controlling risks through established policies and procedures. We have developed and maintain contingency plans designed to prepare us to respond to potential adverse outcomes and scenarios. Our risk appetite statement ensures that we maintain an acceptable risk profile by providing a common framework for senior management and the board to indicate the level of risk the corporation is willing to accept. The board oversees compliance with safe and sound banking practices and conducts inquiries into risk-related matters. We employ a risk management process, referred to as immc: identify, measure, monitor, and control, as part of our daily activities. Our overall capacity to take risk is limited; therefore, we prioritize the risks we take to maintain a strong and flexible financial position. Our strategic plan takes into consideration return objectives and financial resources, which must align with risk capacity and risk appetite. We conduct corporation-wide stress tests to understand balance sheet, earnings, capital, and liquidity sensitivities to certain economic and business scenarios. Our businesses are highly dependent on the security and efficacy of our infrastructure, computer, and data management systems, as well as those of third parties with whom we interact. Cyber security risks for financial institutions have significantly increased in recent years, and we continuously update our systems to support our operations and growth. Our operational risk exposures could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, and financial condition.

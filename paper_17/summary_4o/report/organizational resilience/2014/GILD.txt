In evaluating our business, we recognize that a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales of products to treat HCV and HIV, and any inability to maintain or increase sales levels could adversely affect our results of operations. We face increased pricing pressure and have provided significant discounts or rebates to obtain formulary status, which may impact our anticipated revenues. The healthcare environment is characterized by external pressures, including fiscal crises and government measures to manage healthcare expenditures, which could lead to reduced access for patients and negatively impact our future product sales. Our operational flexibility is challenged by the unpredictable nature of reimbursement levels and formulary coverage, which can limit patient access to our products. We continue to experience fluctuations in purchasing patterns from non-retail customers, influenced by federal and state budget pressures, which may not reflect actual patient demand. The global economic downturn has induced variations in purchasing patterns, particularly in Europe, affecting our revenues. Legislative and regulatory changes, including healthcare reforms, may also adversely affect our business, as they can impose additional rebates and discounts that reduce profitability. 

Our operations depend on compliance with complex regulations, and failure to maintain compliance could delay or halt commercialization of our products. We rely on third-party contract research organizations for clinical trials, and any disruption in these relationships could delay our product development. The success of our commercialization efforts is contingent upon maintaining collaborative relationships with other companies, and disputes or poor performance by these partners could negatively impact our business. We also face significant competition from large pharmaceutical companies and generic manufacturers, which could adversely affect our market share and revenues. 

Our ability to adapt to changing market conditions is critical, as we must respond effectively to environmental disruptions and innovate to maintain our competitive advantage. The complexity of our supply chain and reliance on third-party manufacturers pose risks to our operational continuity, particularly if there are disruptions in manufacturing capacity. We are also subject to risks associated with cybersecurity, as our information technology systems are vulnerable to service interruptions and data breaches, which could have significant implications for our business operations. 

In summary, our organizational resilience is tested by various factors including external pressures, regulatory changes, competitive dynamics, and operational challenges. Our ability to navigate these complexities while maintaining performance and adapting to unforeseen circumstances is essential for sustaining our business and achieving long-term success.

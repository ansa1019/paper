IT capability is a firm's ability to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure IT resources in support and enhancement of business strategies and work processes. we focus on information management capability—that is, the ability to provide data and information to users with the appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access and the ability to tailor these in response to changing business needs and directions. at its core, the notion of it capability underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying it-based resources in combination with, and leveraging the value of, other resources and capabilities. it capability, broadly defined as the it function’s competence to effectively support business needs, has become a key in transforming a firm into a competitive force. a firm’s it capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible it resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, business process understanding and human resources to further organizational goals.\"\"\"\n\nText:\n\"\"\"item 1a. risk factors in addition to the other information in this 2014 form 10-k, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business because such factors may significantly impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. as a result of these risk factors, as well as other risks discussed in our other sec filings, our actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. no priority or significance is intended, nor should be attached, to the order in which the risk factors appear. the semiconductor equipment industry is subject to fluctuations and, as a result, we face risks related to our strategic resource allocation decisions the business cycle in the semiconductor equipment industry has historically been characterized by frequent periods of rapid change in demand that challenge our management to adjust spending and other resources allocated to operating activities. during periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services, we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems, procedures for training and managing our work force, and in appropriately sizing our supply chain infrastructure, work force, and other components of our business on a timely basis. if we do not adequately meet these challenges during periods of demand decline, our gross margins and earnings may be negatively impacted. 14 we continuously reassess our strategic resource allocation choices in response to the changing business environment. if we do not adequately adapt to the changing business environment, we may lack the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during a period of growth, or we may expand our capacity too rapidly and/or beyond what is appropriate for the actual demand environment. especially during transitional periods, resource allocation decisions can have a significant impact on our future performance, particularly if we have not accurately anticipated industry changes. our success will depend, to a significant extent, on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively. future declines in the semiconductor industry, and the overall world economic conditions on which it is significantly dependent, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers, which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits. the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and experiences periodic downturns. global economic and business conditions, which are often unpredictable, have historically impacted customer demand for our products and normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers, and creditors. additionally, in times of economic uncertainty our customers' budgets for our products, or their ability to access credit to purchase them, could be adversely affected. this would limit their ability to purchase our products and services. as a result, economic downturns can cause material adverse changes to our results of operations and financial condition including, but not limited to:  a decline in demand for our products or services;  an increase in reserves on accounts receivable due to our customers' inability to pay us;  an increase in reserves on inventory balances due to excess or obsolete inventory as a result of our inability to sell such inventory;  valuation allowances on deferred tax assets;  restructuring charges;  asset impairments including the potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets;  a decline in the value of our investments;  exposure to claims from our suppliers for payment on inventory that is ordered in anticipation of customer purchases that do not come to fruition;  a decline in the value of certain facilities we lease to less than our residual value guarantee with the lessor; and  challenges maintaining reliable and uninterrupted sources of supply. fluctuating levels of investment by semiconductor manufacturers may materially affect our aggregate shipments, revenues, operating results and earnings. where appropriate, we will attempt to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams, which sometimes result in restructuring charges. even during periods of reduced revenues, we must continue to invest in r&d and maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive, which may temporarily harm our profitability and other financial results. our quarterly revenues and operating results are variable our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, not all of which are in our control. we manage our expense levels based in part on our expectations of 15 future revenues. because our operating expenses are based in part on anticipated future revenues, and a certain amount of those expenses are relatively fixed, a change in the timing of recognition of revenue and/or the level of gross profit from a small number of transactions can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter. factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include, but are not limited to:  economic conditions in the electronics and semiconductor industries in general and specifically the semiconductor equipment industry;  the size and timing of orders from customers;  procurement shortages;  the failure of our suppliers or outsource providers to perform their obligations in a manner consistent with our expectations;  manufacturing difficulties;  customer cancellations or delays in shipments, installations, and/or customer acceptances;  the extent that customers continue to purchase and use our products and services in their business;  our customers' reuse of existing and installed products, to the extent that such reuse decreases their need to purchase new products or services;  changes in average selling prices, customer mix, and product mix;  our ability in a timely manner to develop, introduce and market new, enhanced, and competitive products;  our competitors' introduction of new products;  legal or technical challenges to our products and technology;  transportation, communication, demand, information technology or supply disruptions based on factors outside our control such as strikes, acts of god, wars, terrorist activities, and natural disasters;  legal, tax, accounting, or regulatory changes (including but not limited to change in import/export regulations) or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing requirements;  changes in our estimated effective tax rate;  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and  the dilutive impact of our convertible notes and related warrants on our earnings per share. we may incur impairments to goodwill or long-lived assets we review our long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets, for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. negative industry or economic trends, including reduced market prices of our common stock, reduced estimates of future cash flows, disruptions to our business, slower growth rates, or lack of growth in our relevant business segments, could lead to impairment charges against our long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets. if, in any period, our stock price decreases to the point where our fair value, as determined by our market capitalization, is less than the book value of our assets, this could also indicate a potential impairment, and we may be required to record an impairment charge in that period, which could adversely affect our result of operations. our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance. we operate in a highly competitive environment and projections of future operating result and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results. additionally, if our analysis indicates potential impairment to goodwill one or more of our business segments, we may be required to record additional charges to earnings in our financial statements, which could negatively affect our results of operations. as a result of historical performance and 16 growth potential, our single-wafer clean systems reporting unit may be at greater risk for goodwill impairment than our other reporting units if our actual results for this reporting unit differ from our projections. our leverage and debt service obligations and potential note conversion or related hedging activities may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and earnings per share as a result of the sale of our 2016 and 2018 convertible notes and the assumption of the 2041 convertible notes in connection with our acquisition of novellus systems, inc. (collectively the \"notes\"), we have a greater amount of debt than we have maintained in the past. our maintenance of higher levels of indebtedness could have adverse consequences including:  impacting our ability to satisfy our obligations;  increasing the portion of our cash flows that may have to be dedicated to interest and principal payments and may not be available for operations, working capital, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes; and  impairing our ability to obtain additional financing in the future. our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. furthermore, our operations may not generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to meet our expenses and service our debt. as a result, we may need to enter into new financing arrangements to obtain the necessary funds. if we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason, we may not be able to obtain such funding or, if funding is available, obtain it on acceptable terms. if we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt, and this default could cause us to be in default on our other outstanding indebtedness. conversion of our notes may cause dilution to our shareholders and to our earnings per share. upon conversion of any notes, we will deliver cash in the amount of the principal amount of the notes and, with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the notes, shares of our common stock, which would result in dilution to our shareholders. this dilution may be mitigated to some extent by the hedging transactions we entered into in connection with the sale of the 2016 and 2018 notes or through share repurchases. prior to the maturity of the notes, if the price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price, u.s. generally accepted accounting principles require that we report an increase in diluted share count, which would result in lower reported earnings per share. the price of our common stock could also be affected by sales of our common stock by investors who view the notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in our company and also by hedging activity that may develop involving our common stock by holders of the notes. our credit agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business. we may be unable to respond to changes in business and economic conditions, engage in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us, or obtain additional financing, because our debt agreements contain, and any of our other future similar agreements may contain, covenant restrictions that limit our ability to, among other things:  incur additional debt, assume obligations in connection with letters of credit, or issue guarantees;  create liens;  enter into transactions with our affiliates;  sell certain assets; and  merge or consolidate with any person. our ability to comply with these covenants is dependent on our future performance, which will be subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including prevailing economic conditions. in addition, our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the notes or our other debt, which could 17 permit the holders to accelerate such debt. if any of our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt, which could materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operation. we have a limited number of key customers sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue, shipments, cash flows, collections and profitability. as a result, the actions of even one customer may subject us to variability in those areas that are difficult to predict. in addition, large customers may be able to negotiate requirements that result in decreased pricing; increased costs and/or lower margins for us; compliance to specific environmental, social and corporate governance standards; and limitations on our ability to share jointly developed technology with others. similarly, significant portions of our credit risk may, at any given time, be concentrated among a limited number of customers, so that the failure of even one of these key customers to pay its obligations to us could significantly impact our financial results. we depend on new products and processes for our success. consequently, we are subject to risks associated with rapid technological change rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances that enable those processes. we believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products. if new products have reliability, quality, or design problems, our performance may be impacted by reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance of and payment for new products, and additional service and warranty expenses. we may be unable to develop and manufacture new products successfully, or new products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace. the expected industry transition to a 450mm platform represents an emerging challenge for our business, and our failure to address that transition in a timely manner with productive and cost-effective products could adversely affect our business in a material way. our failure to commercialize new products in a timely manner could result in loss of market share, unanticipated costs, and inventory obsolescence, which would adversely affect our financial results. in order to develop new products and processes, we expect to continue to make significant investments in r&d and to pursue joint development relationships with customers, suppliers or other members of the industry. we must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully, as the introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products and certain jointly developed technologies may be subject to restrictions on our ability to share that technology with other customers, which could limit our market for products incorporating those technologies. future technologies, processes or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete, leaving us with non-competitive products, or obsolete inventory, or both. moreover, customers may adopt new technologies or processes to address the complex challenges associated with next generation devices. this shift may result in a reduction in the size of our addressable markets or could increase the relative size of markets in which we either do not compete or have relatively low market share. we are subject to risks relating to product concentration and lack of product revenue diversification we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products. system sales constitute a significant portion of our total revenue. our systems are priced up to approximately $9 million per system, and our revenues in any given quarter are dependent upon customer acceptance of a limited number of systems. as a result, the inability to recognize revenue on even a few systems can cause a significantly adverse impact on our revenues for a given quarter, and, in the longer term, the continued market acceptance of these products is critical to our future success. our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by:  a decline in demand for even a limited number of our products; 18  a failure to achieve continued market acceptance of our key products;  export restrictions or other regulatory or legislative actions that could limit our ability to sell those products to key customer or market segments;  an improved version of products being offered by a competitor in the market in which we participate;  increased pressure from competitors that offer broader product lines;  technological changes that we are unable to address with our products; or  a failure to release new or enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis. in addition, the fact that we offer limited product lines creates the risk that our customers may view us as less important to their business than our competitors that offer additional products. this may impact our ability to maintain or expand our business with certain customers. such product concentration may also subject us to additional risks associated with technology changes. our business is affected by our customers' use of our products in certain steps in their wafer fabrication processes. should technologies change so that the manufacture of semiconductors requires fewer steps using our products, this could have a larger impact on our business than it would on the business of our less concentrated competitors. strategic alliances and customer consolidation may have negative effects on our business increasingly, semiconductor manufacturing companies are entering into strategic alliances or consolidating with one another to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies and/or achieve economies of scale. the outcomes of such an alliance can be the definition of a particular tool set for a certain function and/or the standardization of a series of process steps that use a specific set of manufacturing equipment; while the outcomes of consolidation can lead to an overall reduction in the market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment as customers' operations achieve economies of scale and/or increased purchasing power based on their higher volumes. in certain instances this could work to our disadvantage if a competitor's tools or equipment become the standard equipment for such functions or processes. some semiconductor manufacturing companies are also consolidating. additional outcomes of such consolidation may include our customers: (i) re-evaluating their future supplier relationships to consider other competitors' products and/or (ii) gaining additional influence over the pricing of products and the control of intellectual property. similarly, our customers may partner with, or follow the lead of, educational or research institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps. if those institutions utilize a competitor's equipment when they establish those processes, it is likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing lines. even if they select our equipment, the institutions and the customers that follow their lead could impose conditions on acceptance of that equipment, such as adherence to standards and requirements or limitations on how we license our proprietary rights that increase our costs or require us to take on greater risk. these actions could adversely impact our market share and financial results. we depend on a limited number of key suppliers and outsource providers, and we run the risk that they might not perform as we expect outsource providers and component suppliers have played and will continue to play a key role in our manufacturing operations and in many of our transactional and administrative functions, such as information technology, facilities management, and certain elements of our finance organization. these providers and suppliers might suffer financial setbacks, be acquired by third parties, become subject to exclusivity arrangements that preclude further business with us or suffer force majeure events that could interrupt or impair their continued ability to perform as we expect. although we attempt to select reputable providers and suppliers, and we attempt to secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts, it is possible that one or more of these providers or suppliers could fail 19 to perform as we expect, and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business. in some cases, the requirements of our business mandate that we obtain certain components and sub-assemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. where practical, we endeavor to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any single provider or supplier will adversely affect our business, but this is not feasible in all circumstances. there is therefore a risk that a prolonged inability to obtain certain components or secure key services could impair our ability to manage operations, ship products and generate revenues, which could adversely affect our operating results and damage our customer relationships. we face risks related to the disruption of our primary manufacturing facilities our manufacturing facilities are concentrated in just a few locations. these locations are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons such as natural disasters, terrorist attacks, disruptions of our information technology resources and utility interruptions. such disruptions may cause delays in shipping our products which could result in the loss of business or customer trust, adversely affecting our business and operating results. once a semiconductor manufacturer commits to purchase a competitor's semiconductor manufacturing equipment, the manufacturer typically continues to purchase that competitor's equipment, making it more difficult for us to sell our equipment to that customer semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line. we believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier's processing equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time. accordingly, we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitor's equipment for the same product line application. we face a challenging and complex competitive environment we face significant competition from multiple competitors and with the pending merger of two of our largest competitors we may face increasing competitive pressures. other companies continue to develop systems and products that are competitive to ours and may introduce new products, which may affect our ability to sell our existing products. we face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop, as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers. we believe that to remain competitive we must devote significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to invest in product and process r&d. certain of our competitors, including those that are created and financially backed by foreign governments, have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to offer customers a more comprehensive array of products and to therefore increasingly dominate the semiconductor equipment industry. these competitors may deeply discount or give away products similar to those that we sell, challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar accommodations and threatening our ability to sell those products. we also face competition from our own customers, who in some instances have established affiliated entities that manufacture equipment similar to ours. for these reasons, we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide. in addition, our competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. in particular, while we continue to develop product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements, we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully, or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive. accordingly, competition may intensify, and we may be unable to continue to compete successfully in our markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows. 20 our future success depends heavily on international sales and the management of global operations non-u.s. sales accounted for approximately 86% of total revenue in fiscal 2014, 80% of total revenue in fiscal year 2013, and 83% of total revenue in fiscal year 2012. we expect that international sales will continue to account for a substantial majority of our total revenue in future years. we are subject to various challenges related to international sales and the management of global operations including, but not limited to:  trade balance issues;  global economic and political conditions;  changes in currency controls;  differences in the enforcement of intellectual property and contract rights in varying jurisdictions;  our ability to respond to customer and foreign government demands for locally sourced systems, spare parts and services and develop the necessary relationships with local suppliers;  compliance with u.s. and international laws and regulations affecting foreign operations, including u.s. and international export restrictions and foreign labor laws;  fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates;  our ability to repatriate cash in a tax-efficient manner;  the need for technical support resources in different locations; and  our ability to secure and retain qualified people in all necessary locations for the successful operation of our business. certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses from the u.s. government. our failure or inability to obtain such licenses would substantially limit our markets and severely restrict our revenues. many of the challenges noted above are applicable in china, which is a fast developing market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore an area of potential significant growth for our business. as the business volume between china and the rest of the world grows, there is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships among china, taiwan, japan, south korea, and the united states, that political and diplomatic influences might lead to trade disruptions. this would adversely affect our business with china, taiwan, japan, and/or south korea and perhaps the entire asia pacific region. a significant trade disruption in these areas could have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits. we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates. the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in u.s. dollars. however, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to revenues denominated in japanese yen and expenses denominated in euro. currently, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short-term impact of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities; primarily third party accounts receivables, accounts payables and intercompany receivables and payables. in addition, we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows, primarily anticipated revenues denominated in japanese yen and euro-denominated expenses. we believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation. we expect to continue to enter into hedging transactions, for the purposes outlined, for the foreseeable future. however, these hedging transactions may not achieve their desired effect because differences between the actual timing of the underlying exposures and our forecasts of those exposures may leave us either over-or under-hedged on any given transaction. moreover, by hedging these foreign currency denominated revenues, expenses, monetary assets and liabilities with foreign currency forward contracts, we may miss favorable currency trends that would have been advantageous to us but for the hedges. additionally, we are exposed to short-term foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on non-u.s. dollar-denominated monetary 21 assets and liabilities (other than those currency exposures previously discussed) and currently we do not enter into foreign currency hedge contracts against these exposures. therefore, we are subject to both favorable and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that we transact business (including intercompany transactions) for these currencies. the magnitude of our overseas business also affects where our cash is generated. certain uses of cash, such as share repurchases or the repayment of our convertible notes, can usually only be made with cash balances and cash generated on-shore. since the majority of our cash is generated outside of the united states, this may limit certain business decisions and adversely affect business outcomes. our ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is critical to our success our ability to compete successfully depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees. this is an ongoing challenge due to intense competition for top talent, as well as fluctuations in industry economic conditions that may require cycles of hiring activity and workforce reductions. our success in hiring depends on a variety of factors, including the attractiveness of our compensation and benefit programs and our ability to offer a challenging and rewarding work environment. we periodically evaluate our overall compensation programs and make adjustments, as appropriate, to maintain or enhance their competitiveness. if we are not able to successfully attract, retain and motivate key employees, we may be unable to capitalize on market opportunities and our operating results may be materially and adversely affected. we rely upon certain critical information systems for the operation of our business we maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business. these information systems include telecommunications, the internet, our corporate intranet, various computer hardware and software applications, network communications, and e-mail. these information systems may be owned and maintained by us, our outsourced providers or third parties such as vendors and contractors. many of these outsourced service providers, including certain hosted software applications that we use for confidential data storage, employ \"cloud computing\" technology for such storage (which refers to an information technology hosting and delivery system in which data is not stored within the user's physical infrastructure but instead are delivered to and consumed by the user as an internet-based service). all of these information systems are subject to attacks, failures, and access denials from a number of potential sources including viruses, destructive or inadequate code, power failures, and physical damage to computers, hard drives, communication lines, and networking equipment. confidential and/or sensitive information stored on these information systems could be intentionally or unintentionally compromised, lost and/or stolen. while we have implemented security procedures, such as virus protection software and emergency recovery processes, to mitigate the outlined risks with respect to information systems that are under our control, they cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe and our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time, or unauthorized releases of confidential information, could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business. our financial results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities as a global company, our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions, and significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities. our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates, in the valuation of deferred tax assets, in tax laws, by material audit assessments, or changes in or expirations of agreements with tax authorities. these factors could affect our profitability. in particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the united states, is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states. in addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability. 22 a failure to comply with environmental regulations may adversely affect our operating results we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the handling, discharge, and disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals. we believe that we are generally in compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained (or will obtain or are otherwise addressing the need for) all environmental permits necessary to conduct our business. these permits generally relate to the handling and disposal of hazardous wastes. nevertheless, the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, require us to suspend production, or cease operations or cause our customers to not accept our products. these regulations could require us to alter our current operations, to acquire significant additional equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations. any failure to comply with regulations governing the use, handling, sale, transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities. if we choose to acquire or dispose of businesses, product lines and technologies, we may encounter unforeseen costs and difficulties that could impair our financial performance an important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products, augment our market coverage and distribution ability, or enhance our technological capabilities. as a result, we may make acquisitions of complementary companies, products or technologies, or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies that no longer fit our long-term strategies. managing an acquired business, disposing of product technologies or reducing personnel entail numerous operational and financial risks, including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups, diversion of management's attention away from other business concerns, amortization of acquired intangible assets, adverse customer reaction to our decision to cease support for a product, and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations. there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions, disposition of product lines or technologies, or reduction in personnel or that our management, personnel, or systems will be adequate to support continued operations. any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. in addition, any acquisition could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, the amortization of related intangible assets, and goodwill impairment charges, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and/or the price of our common stock. the market for our common stock is volatile, which may affect our ability to raise capital, make acquisitions, or subject our business to additional costs the market price for our common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years. the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors, many of which are not within our control or influence. these factors include but are not limited to the following:  general market, semiconductor, or semiconductor equipment industry conditions;  economic or political events and trends occurring globally or in any of our key sales regions;  variations in our quarterly operating results and financial condition, including our liquidity;  variations in our revenues, earnings or other business and financial metrics from forecasts by us or securities analysts, or from those experienced by other companies in our industry;  announcements of restructurings, reductions in force, departure of key employees, and/or consolidations of operations;  government regulations; 23  developments in, or claims relating to, patent or other proprietary rights;  technological innovations and the introduction of new products by us or our competitors;  commercial success or failure of our new and existing products;  disruptions of relationships with key customers or suppliers; or  dilutive impacts of our notes and related warrants. in addition, the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations. historically, we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our common stock due in part to the price of and markets for semiconductors. these and other factors have and may again adversely affect the price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. in the past, following volatile periods in the price of their stock, many companies became the object of securities class action litigation. if we are sued in a securities class action, we could incur substantial costs, and it could divert management's attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on our financial performance and the price for our common stock. intellectual property, indemnity and other claims against us can be costly and we could lose significant rights that are necessary to our continued business and profitability third parties may assert infringement, unfair competition, product liability, breach of contract, or other claims against us. from time to time, other parties send us notices alleging that our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights. in addition, law enforcement authorities may seek criminal charges relating to intellectual property or other issues. we also face risks of claims arising from commercial and other relationships. in addition, our bylaws and other indemnity obligations provide that we will indemnify officers and directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to us. from time to time, in the normal course of business, we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships, including customers and suppliers, with respect to certain matters. we have agreed, under certain conditions, to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses, such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants, other third party claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such other third parties, or other claims made against certain parties. in such cases, it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms. however, we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially adversely affect our business and financial results, and we may be subject to substantial damage awards and penalties. moreover, although we have insurance to protect us from certain claims and cover certain losses to our property, such insurance may not cover us for the full amount of any losses, or at all, and may be subject to substantial exclusions and deductibles. we may fail to protect our critical proprietary technology rights, which could affect our business our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and our ability to protect key components of that technology through patents, copyrights and trade secret protection. protecting our key proprietary technology helps us to achieve our goals of developing technological expertise and new products and systems that give us a competitive advantage; increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base; and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers. as part of our strategy to protect our technology we currently hold a number of u.s. and foreign patents and pending patent applications, and we keep certain information, processes and techniques as trade secrets. however, other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the united states or foreign governments issue to us, these governments may fail to issue patents for pending applications, or we may lose trade secret protection over valuable information due to the intentional or unintentional actions or omissions of third parties, of ours or even our own employees. additionally, intellectual property litigation can be expensive and time-consuming and even when patents are issued or trade secret processes are followed, the legal systems in certain of the countries in which we 24 do business do not enforce patents and other intellectual property rights as rigorously as the united states. the rights granted or anticipated under any of our patents, pending patent applications or trade secrets may be narrower than we expect or, in fact, provide no competitive advantages. moreover, because we determine the jurisdictions in which to file patents at the time of filing, we may not have adequate protection in the future based on such previous decisions. any of these circumstances could have a material adverse impact on our business. we are exposed to various risks from our regulatory environment we are subject to various risks related to (i) new, different, inconsistent or even conflicting laws, rules and regulations that may be enacted by legislative bodies and/or regulatory agencies in the countries that we operate; (ii) disagreements or disputes between national or regional regulatory agencies related to international trade; and (iii) the interpretation and application of laws, rules and regulations. as a public company with global operations, we are subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, including those related to financial and other disclosures, corporate governance, privacy, anti-corruption, such as the foreign corrupt practices act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and antitrust regulations, among others. one of these laws imposes new disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals, which may have originated from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries in our products. this new requirement could affect the pricing, sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of components we use in our products. in addition, there will be additional costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of any of the covered minerals used in our products. our supply chain is complex, and we may be unable to verify the origins for all metals used in our products. financial reform legislation and the regulations enacted under such legislation have also added costs to our business by, among other things, requiring advisory votes on executive compensation and on severance packages upon a change in control. to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with all evolving standards. changes in or ambiguous interpretations of laws, regulations and standards may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters. efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management's time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities. if we are found by a court or regulatory agency not to be in compliance with the laws and regulations, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase our shares at all or in any particular amounts. our board of directors announced its plans to declare a quarterly dividend on april 29, 2014, with the first dividend payment paid on july 2, 2014. in addition, on april 29, 2014, we announced that our board of directors has authorized the company to repurchase up to $850 million of common stock, which includes the remaining value available under the prior authorization of $250 million. our intent to continue to pay quarterly dividends and to repurchase our shares is subject to capital availability and, in the case of dividends, periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends by us. future dividends and share repurchases may also be affected by, among other factors: our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our research and development; legal risks; stock repurchase programs; changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws; and changes to our business model. our dividend payments and share repurchases may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or repurchase shares at all or in any particular amounts. a reduction or suspension in our dividend payments or share repurchase activity could have a negative effect on our stock price. 25 item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect. our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in \"risk factors\" and elsewhere in this 2014 form 10-k and other documents we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission. (see \"cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements\" in part i of this 2014 form 10-k). management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (\"md&a\") provides a description of our results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in this 2014 form 10-k. md&a consists of the following sections: executive summary provides a summary of the key highlights of our results of operations and our management's assessment of material trends and uncertainties relevant to our business. results of operations provides an analysis of operating results. critical accounting policies and estimates discusses accounting policies that reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. liquidity and capital resources provides an analysis of cash flows, contractual obligations and financial position. executive summary lam research has been an innovative supplier of wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry for more than 30 years. our customers include semiconductor manufacturers that make memory, microprocessors, and other logic integrated circuits for a wide range of electronics; including cell phones, computers, storage devices and networking equipment. our market-leading products are designed to help our customers build the smaller, faster and more power-efficient devices that are necessary to power the capabilities required by end users. the process of integrated circuits fabrication consists of a complex series of process and preparation steps and lam's product offerings in deposition, etch and clean address a number of the most critical steps in the fabrication process. we leverage our expertise in semiconductor processing to develop technology and productivity solutions that typically benefit our customers through lower defect rates, enhanced yields, faster processing time, and reduced cost as well as by facilitating their ability to meet more stringent performance and design standards. the semiconductor capital equipment industry has been highly competitive and subject to business cycles that historically have been characterized by rapid changes in demand. more recently with consolidation in the customer base, the cyclical behavior appears to have diminished somewhat. with a reduced number of customers, variability in their business plans may lead to changes in demand for lam's equipment and services over certain periods. the variability in our customers' investments during any particular period is dependent on several factors including but not limited to electronics demand, economic conditions (both general and in the semiconductor and electronics industries), industry supply and demand, prices for semiconductors, and our customers' ability to develop and manufacture increasingly complex and costly semiconductor devices. demand for our products increased steadily throughout fiscal year 2014 as semiconductor device manufacturers made capacity and technology investments. technology inflections have been in industry inflection points that include finfet transistors, 3-d nand and multiple patterning. these technology inflections have led to an increase in the deposition, etch and clean market size. this increase, as well as market share gains in these inflections, have contributed to the increased revenue in fiscal 2014. we believe that, over the longer term, demand for our products should increase as the proportion of customers' capital expenditures rise in these technology inflection areas, and we continue to gain market share. 32 the following summarizes certain key annual financial information for the periods indicated below: year ended june 29, june 30. june 24, fy14 vs. fy13 fy13 vs. fy12 2014 2013 2012 (in thousands, except per share data and percentages) revenue $4,607,309 $3,598,916 $2,665,192 $1,008,393 28.0 % $933,724 35.0 % gross margin $2,007,481 $1,403,059 $1,084,069 $604,422 43.1 % $318,990 29.4 % gross margin as a percent of total revenue 43.6 % 39.0 % 40.7 % 4.6 % -1.7 % total operating expenses $1,329,812 $1,284,988 $846,336 $44,824 3.5 % $438,652 51.8 % net income $632,289 $113,879 $168,723 $518,410 455.2 % $(54,844 ) -32.5 % diluted net income per share $3.62 $0.66 $1.35 $2.96 448.5 % $(0.69 ) -51.1 % on june 4, 2012, we completed our acquisition of novellus systems, inc (\"novellus\"). results for fiscal years 2014 and 2013 include novellus operations. results for fiscal year 2012 include novellus operations from the acquisition date through june 24, 2012. lam's primary reasons for this acquisition were to complement existing product offerings and to provide opportunities for revenue growth and cost synergies. fiscal year 2014 revenues increased 28% compared to fiscal year 2013, reflecting the increase in technology inflections' spending, as well as, incremental market share gains. the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was due primarily to a decrease in novellus acquisition-related inventory fair value adjustments, improved business volumes and product mix. operating expenses in fiscal year 2014 increased as compared to fiscal year 2013 primarily related to continued investments in the next-generation research and development and customer facing activities. our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and investments balances totaled approximately $3.2 billion as of june 29, 2014 compared to $2.7 billion as of june 30, 2013. this increase was primarily the result of $717 million of cash flows from operating activities, offset by $245 million in share repurchases. this compares to $720 million in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2013. results of operations shipments and backlog year ended june 29, june 30, june 24, 2014 2013 2012 shipments (in millions) $4,551 $3,714 $2,672 korea 24 % 16 % 36 % taiwan 21 % 29 % 18 % japan 13 % 11 % 10 % china 15 % 9 % 6 % united states 15 % 20 % 17 % europe 7 % 8 % 8 % southeast asia 5 % 7 % 5 % shipments for fiscal year 2014 were approximately $4.6 billion and increased by 23% compared to fiscal year 2013. shipments for fiscal year 2013 were approximately $3.7 billion and increased by 39% compared to fiscal year 2012. the increase in shipments during fiscal year 2014 as compared to fiscal year 2013 related to continued strengthening of customer demand through fiscal year 2014. the increase in shipments during fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2012 related to having a full year of combined operations with novellus and the strengthening of customer demand in the second half of fiscal year 2013. 33 the percentage of total semiconductor processing system shipments to each of the market segments we serve were as follows for fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012. year ended june 29, june 30, june 24, 2014 2013 2012 memory 60 % 36 % 45 % foundry 30 % 49 % 46 % logic/integrated device manufacturing 10 % 15 % 9 % during fiscal year 2014, memory customer demand was higher due to node transitions in memory manufacturing, stable pricing for memory, and tight industry supply. unshipped orders in backlog as of june 29, 2014 were approximately $866 million and increased from approximately $764 million as of june 30, 2013. our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems, spares, and services. please refer to \"backlog\" in part i item 1, \"business\" of this report for a description of our policies for adding to and adjusting backlog. revenue year ended june 29, june 30, june 24, 2014 2013 2012 revenue (in millions) $4,607 $3,599 $2,665 korea 24 % 17 % 33 % taiwan 23 % 29 % 18 % japan 14 % 10 % 12 % china 14 % 9 % 5 % united states 13 % 20 % 17 % europe 7 % 8 % 9 % southeast asia 5 % 7 % 6 % the revenue increase in fiscal year 2014 as compared to fiscal year 2013 reflected increased customer and industry demand. the revenue increase in fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2012 reflected a full fiscal year of operations post-acquisition of novellus. our revenue levels are generally correlated to the amount of shipments and our installation and acceptance timelines. the overall asia region continues to account for a majority of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity additions for semiconductor manufacturing continues to occur in this region. our deferred revenue balance was $361.6 million as of june 29, 2014 compared to $389.2 million as of june 30, 2013. our deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to japanese customers, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. shipments to japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of customer acceptance. the anticipated future revenue value from shipments to japanese customers was approximately $34 million as of june 29, 2014 compared to $70 million as of june 30, 2013. gross margin year ended june 29, june 30, june 24, fy14 vs. fy13 fy13 vs. fy12 2014 2013 2012 (in thousands, except percentages) gross margin $2,007,481 $1,403,059 $1,084,069 $604,422 43.1 % $318,990 29.4 % percent of total revenue 43.6 % 39.0 % 40.7 % 4.6 % -1.7 % 34 the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was due to higher business volumes as well as a more favorable product mix. additionally, the novellus acquisition related inventory fair value impact and cost associated with rationalization of certain product configurations decreased by $78 million and $15 million, respectively, in fiscal year 2014 as compared to fiscal year 2013. the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012 was due primarily to higher novellus acquisition-related inventory fair value adjustments of approximately $77 million, amortization of acquired intangible assets of approximately $78 million, and $16 million of costs associated with rationalization of certain product configurations. offsetting these higher novellus acquisition and product configuration-related expenses was a favorable change in gross margin as a result of increased business volume. research and development year ended june 29, june 30, june 24, 2014 2013 2012 fy14 vs. fy13 fy13 vs. fy12 (in thousands, except percentages) research &amp; development (\"r&amp;d\") $716,471 $683,688 $444,559 $32,783 4.8 % $239,129 53.8 % percent of total revenue 15.6 % 19.0 % 16.7 % -3.4 % 2.3 % we continued to make significant r&d investments focused on leading-edge deposition, plasma etch, single-wafer clean and other semiconductor manufacturing requirements. the increase in r&d expense during fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to a $41 million increase in salaries and benefits related to higher headcount and higher incentive and equity compensation offset by a reduction of $7 million in supplies. the increase in r&d spending during fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012 reflects a full year of combined operations with novellus. increased r&d expense included $111 million in salary and benefits mainly due to higher headcount, $46 million in supplies, $26 million in depreciation and amortization due to new product development, $15 million in outside services, and an additional $12 million in rent, utilities and repairs. selling, general and administrative year ended june 29, june 30, june 24, fy14 vs. fy13 fy13 vs. fy12 2014 2013 2012 (in thousands, except percentages) selling, general &amp; administrative (\"sg&amp;a\") $613,341 $601,300 $401,777 $12,041 2.0 % $199,523 49.7 % percent of total revenue 13.3 % 16.7 % 15.1 % -3.4 % 1.6 % the increase in sg&a expense during fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was due primarily to a net increase of $11 million in salaries, benefits and incentive compensation, $20 million increase in marketing expenses and outside services, $7 million in costs associated with rationalization of certain product configurations, $8 million of impairment of a long lived asset, and a $5 million cost related to the renewal of our fremont and livermore buildings' operating leases. this increase was offset by a $34 million reduction in integration costs and a $10 million reduction in amortization of intangible assets related to the novellus integration. the increase in sg&a expense during fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012 was due primarily to the impact of combined operations with novellus. increased expense includes $108 million in salary and benefits 35 due to a higher headcount, $73 million of intangible asset amortization, $29 million in integration cost, and $14 million in rent/repair/utilities, all offset by a $47 million decrease in novellus acquisition-related cost. gain on sale of real estate during the fiscal year 2014, we sold our interest in nonessential property in palo alto, california, resulting in $135 million in net proceeds and a realized gain of $83 million from the transaction. other expense, net other expense, net, consisted of the following: year ended june 29, june 30, june 24, 2014 2013 2012 (in thousands) interest income $12,540 $14,737 $12,141 interest expense (61,692 ) (60,408 ) (38,962 ) gains (losses) on deferred compensation plan related assets, net 9,559 9,764 (914 ) foreign exchange gains (losses), net 1,529 (6,808 ) (397 ) other, net 668 (8,698 ) (5,183 ) $(37,396 ) $(51,413 ) $(33,315 ) the increase in interest expense during fiscal year 2013 as compared with fiscal year 2012 was primarily due to the 2041 convertible notes assumed in june 2012 in connection with the novellus acquisition. foreign exchange gains in fiscal year 2014 and losses in fiscal years 2013 and 2012 were related to un-hedged portions of the balance sheet exposures. other income realized during fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to a gain on the disposition of a private equity investment. other expenses during fiscal year 2013 included a $4 million other-than-temporary impairment of a public equity investment recognized during the march 2013 quarter. other expenses during fiscal year 2012 included a $2 million other-than temporary impairment of a private equity investment recognized during the september 2011 quarter. income tax expense (benefit) year ended june 29, june 30, june 24, 2014 2013 2012 (in thousands) provision for income taxes $91,074 $(47,221 ) $35,695 effective tax rate 12.6 % -70.8 % 17.5 % the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2014 as compared to fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to the change in the level of income and geographic mix of income between higher and lower tax jurisdictions, u.s. income and applicable foreign withholding taxes on undistributed foreign earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries for 2014, reduced tax benefit in fiscal year 2014 due to the expiration of the federal research and development tax credit as of december 31, 2013, and tax benefits in fiscal year 2013 related to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to the lapse of the statute of limitations and successful resolution of certain tax matters. the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2012 was 36 primarily due to the level of income, tax benefits related to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to the lapse of the statute of limitations and successful resolution of certain tax matters, the change in geographical mix of income between higher and lower tax jurisdictions, and tax benefit due to the retroactive reinstatement of the federal research and development tax credit in january 2013. international revenues account for a significant portion of our total revenues, such that a material portion of our pre-tax income is earned and taxed outside the united states at rates that are generally lower than in the united states. please refer to note 15 to consolidated financial statements. deferred income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. our gross deferred tax assets, composed primarily of reserves and accruals that are not currently deductible and tax credit carryforwards, were $343 million and $318 million at the end of fiscal years 2014 and 2013, respectively. these gross deferred tax assets were offset by deferred tax liabilities of $294 million and $259 million at the end of fiscal years 2014 and 2013, respectively, and a valuation allowance of $74 million and $77 million at the end of fiscal years 2014 and 2013, respectively. the change in the gross deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities between fiscal year 2014 and 2013 is primarily due to accrual for future tax liability due to the expected repatriation of foreign earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries for 2014 and amortization of convertible debt, offset by increase in deferred tax assets related to accounting allowances and reserves. our fiscal years 2014 and 2013 valuation allowance of $74 million and $77 million primarily relate to california and certain foreign deferred tax assets. at our fiscal year end of june 29, 2014 we continue to record a valuation allowance to offset the entire california deferred tax asset balance due to the impact of the single sales factor apportionment election resulting in lower taxable income in california. we also continue to record valuation allowance on certain foreign entities' net operating losses. we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to assess the need for changes in valuation allowances, if any. uncertain tax positions we reevaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. this evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (\"gaap\") requires management to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. we based our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believed to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions. actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in note 2 of our consolidated financial statements. some of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies. a critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on 37 our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, complex and/or subjective judgments, often regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. recognition: we recognize all revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, collection of the receivable is reasonably assured, and we have received customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations. if terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period, we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance, whichever occurs first. if the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision, we recognize revenue when it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreed-to customer specifications. in situations with multiple deliverables, we recognize revenue upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations. we allocate revenue from multiple-element arrangements among the separate elements based on their relative selling prices, provided the elements have value on a stand-alone basis. our sales arrangements do not include a general right of return. the maximum revenue we recognize on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items. we generally recognize revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits upon shipment. we generally recognize revenue related to services upon completion of the services requested by a customer order. we recognize revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. when goods or services have been delivered to the customer but all conditions for revenue recognition have not been met, we record deferred revenue and/or deferred costs of sales in deferred profit on our consolidated balance sheet. inventory valuation: inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard costs that approximate actual costs on a first-in, first-out basis. we maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity on-hand and standard cost for each product, including purchased components, subassemblies, and finished goods. we maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand. finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer. unless specified in the terms of sale, title generally transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier. transfer of title for shipments to japanese customers generally occurs at the time of customer acceptance. management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly. our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods, and spare parts in each reporting period. obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management's estimated usage requirement is written down to its estimated market value if less than cost. estimates of market value include, but are not limited to, management's forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and/or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, and possible alternative uses. if future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period in which we make the revision. warranty: typically, the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and service warranties to customers as part of the overall price of the system. we provide standard warranties for our systems. we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system when we recognize revenue. we do not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific systems. the amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity that uses factors such as type of system, customer, geographic region, and any known factors such as tool reliability trends. all actual or estimated parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves on a system-by-system basis. 38 while we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. in addition to the provision of standard warranties, we offer customer-paid extended warranty services. revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. related costs are recorded as incurred. equity-based compensation  employee stock purchase plan (\"espp\") and employee stock plans: gaap requires us to recognize the fair value of equity-based compensation in net income. we determine the fair value of our restricted stock units (\"rsus\"), excluding market-based performance rsus, based on the fair market value of company stock at the date of grant. we estimate the fair value of our market-based performance rsus using a monte carlo simulation model at the date of the grant. we estimate the fair value of our stock options and espp awards using the black-scholes option valuation model. this model requires us to input highly subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award. we amortize the fair value of equity-based awards over the vesting periods of the awards, and we have elected to use the straight-line method of amortization. we make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our tax credit pool related to equity-based compensation to determine if there are any deficiencies that we are required to recognize in our consolidated statements of operations. we will only recognize a benefit from stock-based compensation in paid-in-capital if we realize an incremental tax benefit after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized. in addition, we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stock-based compensation on the research tax credit through the income statement (continuing operations) rather than through paid-in-capital. we have also elected to net deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for the accumulated stock award tax benefits for income tax footnote disclosure purposes. we will track these stock award attributes separately and will only recognize these attributes through paid-in-capital. income taxes: deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. we believe it is more-likely-than-not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at the time. in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. likewise, if we later determine that it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. please refer to note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. in addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. this evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period such determination is made. 39 goodwill and intangible assets: the valuation of intangible assets acquired in a business combination requires the use of management estimates including but not limited to estimating future expected cash flows from assets acquired and determining discount rates. management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available. goodwill represents the amount by which the purchase price in each business combination exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. each component of the company for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the results of operations is considered a reporting unit. all goodwill acquired in a business combination is assigned to one or more reporting units as of the acquisition date. goodwill is assigned to the company's reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. the goodwill assigned to a reporting unit is the difference between the acquisition consideration assigned to the reporting unit on a relative fair value basis and the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities that can be specifically attributed to the reporting unit. we test goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually. we amortize intangible assets with estimable useful lives over their respective estimated useful lives, and we review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. we review goodwill at least annually for impairment. if certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests, we would perform an impairment test at that date. in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, we: (1) allocate goodwill to our reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates; (2) estimate the fair value of our reporting units; and (3) determine the carrying value (book value) of those reporting units, as some of the assets and liabilities related to those reporting units are not held by those reporting units but by a corporate function. prior to this allocation of the assets to the reporting units, we assess long-lived assets for impairment. furthermore, if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we must estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of that reporting unit, in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business. this can require independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as in-process r&d and developed technology. only after this process is completed can the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, be determined. in our goodwill impairment analysis we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative analysis. we do not calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis, which was performed as of the first day of our fourth quarter, march 31, 2014, did not result in a goodwill impairment charge, nor did we record any goodwill impairment in fiscal 2013 or 2012. as a result of historical performance and growth potential, our single-wafer clean systems reporting unit may be at greater risk for goodwill impairment than our other reporting units if our actual results for this reporting unit differ from our projections. the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis. we determine the fair value of our reporting units by using a weighted combination of both a market and an income approach, as this combination is deemed to be the most indicative of fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants. under the market approach, we use information regarding the reporting unit as well as publicly available industry information to determine various financial multiples to value our reporting units. under the income approach, we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit for the purposes of our annual or periodic analyses, we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of our reporting units, including estimated growth rates and 40 assumptions about the economic environment. although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit. in addition, we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units. we also consider our market capitalization and that of our competitors on the date we perform the analysis. changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge. as a result, several factors could result in impairment of a material amount of our goodwill balance in future periods, including, but not limited to: (1) weakening of the global economy, weakness in the semiconductor equipment industry, or our failure to reach our internal forecasts, which could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted levels of cash flows and reduce the estimated discounted cash flow value of our reporting units; and (2) a decline in our stock price and resulting market capitalization, if we determine that the decline is sustained and indicates a reduction in the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. in addition, the value we assign to intangible assets, other than goodwill, is based on our estimates and judgments regarding expectations such as the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. if actual product acceptance differs significantly from our estimates, we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value. recent accounting pronouncements in july 2013, the fasb released accounting standards update 2013-11 \"presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists.\" the new standard requires that an unrecognized tax benefit should be presented as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward or other tax credit carryforward when settlement in this manner is available under the tax law. we are required to adopt this standard starting in fiscal year 2015 and are currently in the process of determining the impact, if any, on our financial position. in april 2014, the fasb released accounting standards update 2014-8 \"presentation of financial statements and property, plant and equipment: reporting discontinued operations and disclosure of disposals of components of an entity.\" the new standard re-defines discontinued operations and requires only those disposals of components of an entity, including classifications as held for sale, that represent a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results to be reported as discontinued operations. in addition, the new standard expands the disclosure requirements of discontinued operations. we are required to adopt this standard starting in fiscal year 2015 and are currently in the process of determining the impact, if any, on our financial position. in may 2014, the fasb released accounting standards update 2014-9 \"revenue from contracts with customers\" to supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under gaap. the core principle of the standard is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. the new standard defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than required under existing gaap including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. we are required to adopt this standard starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 using either of two methods: (i) retrospective to each prior reporting period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients as defined within the standard; or (ii) retrospective with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures as defined per the standard. we are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of this standard on our financial position. 41 liquidity and capital resources total gross cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and investments balances were $3.2 billion at the end of fiscal year 2014 compared to $2.7 billion at the end of fiscal year 2013. this increase was primarily the result of $717 million of cash flow from operating activities. approximately $2.2 billion and $2.0 billion of our total cash and investments as of june 29, 2014 and june 30, 2013, respectively, were held outside the u.s. in our foreign subsidiaries, the majority of which would be subject to tax at u.s. rates if it were to be repatriated. refer to note 15 of our consolidated financial statements, included in item 15 of this report, for information concerning the potential tax impact of repatriating earnings for certain non-u.s. subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested outside the u.s. cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities of $717 million during fiscal year 2014 consisted of (in millions): net income $632 non-cash charges: depreciation and amortization 292 equity-based compensation 104 deferred income taxes 8 amortization of convertible note discount 33 impairment 12 gain on sale of real estate (83 ) changes in operating asset and liability accounts (293 ) other 12 $717 significant changes in operating asset and liability accounts, net of foreign exchange impact, included the following uses of cash: increases in accounts receivable of $201.5 million, inventories of $190.1 million, and prepaid expenses and other assets of $9.5 million, partially offset by the following sources of cash: increases in accounts payable of $18.7 million, deferred profit of $10.9 million and accrued liabilities of $78.6 million. cash flows from investing activities net cash used for investing activities during fiscal year 2014 was $265.2 million, which was primarily due to net purchases of available-for-sale securities of $284.0 million, and capital expenditures of $145.5 million, partially offset by cash proceeds on the sale of assets of $156.7 million. cash flows from financing activities net cash used for financing activities during fiscal year 2014 was $162.7 million, which was primarily due to $244.9 million in treasury stock repurchases, partially offset by net proceeds from issuance of common stock related to employee equity-based plans of $77.7 million. liquidity given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry, we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in r&d and capital infrastructure. based upon our current business outlook, we expect that our levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at june 29, 2014 will be sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations, investments, debt service requirements, and capital expenditures, through at least the next 12 months. 42 in the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products and services. while we have substantial cash balances in the united states and offshore, we may require additional funding and need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. we believe that, if necessary, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. however, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us. off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we have certain obligations to make future payments under various contracts, some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some of which are not. obligations that are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with gaap include our long-term debt which is outlined in the following table. our off-balance sheet arrangements are presented as operating leases and purchase obligations in the table. our contractual obligations and commitments as of june 29, 2014, relating to these agreements and our guarantees are included in the following table. the amounts in the table below exclude $258 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax benefits as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or time of settlement. see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. total less than 1-3 years 3-5 years more than

for the 2041 notes opened as of june 30, 2013 and remains open as of june 29, 2014. as such, the net carrying value of the 2041 notes is included within current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. the $700 million principal balance of the 2041 notes has been included in the more than 5 years payment period in the table above, which reflects the contractual maturity assuming no conversion. see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements, included in item 15 of this report, for additional information concerning the 2041 notes and associated conversion feature. operating leases we lease most of our administrative, r&d and manufacturing facilities, regional sales/service offices and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. certain of our facility leases for buildings located at our fremont, california headquarters, livermore facilities, and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities. certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation. in addition to amounts included in the table above, we have guaranteed residual values for certain of our fremont and livermore facility leases of up to $191 million. see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. capital leases capital leases reflect building and office equipment lease obligations. the amounts in the table above include the interest portion of payment obligations. purchase obligations purchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multi-year periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments, including vendor-consigned 43 inventories. the contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at june 29, 2014 under these arrangements and others. for obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee. actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided. long-term debt on may 11, 2011, we issued and sold $450.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 0.5% convertible notes due 2016 (the \"2016 notes\") and $450.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.25% convertible notes due 2018 (the \"2018 notes,\" and collectively with the \"2016 notes\", the \"notes\"). the 2016 notes were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of 0.5% per annum and the 2018 notes were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of 1.25% per annum. the notes may be converted into our common stock, under certain circumstances, based on a conversion rate of 15.9128 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which is equal to a conversion price of approximately $62.84 per share of our common stock. the conversion price will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest. concurrently with the issuance of the notes, we purchased convertible note hedges for $181.1 million and sold warrants for $133.8 million. the separate convertible note hedges and warrant transactions are structured to reduce the potential future economic dilution associated with the conversion of the notes. in june 2012, with the acquisition of novellus, we assumed $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.625% convertible senior notes due may 2041 (the \"2041 notes\"). the 2041 notes were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. the 2041 notes may be converted, under certain circumstances, into our common stock based on a conversion rate of 28.5572 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which represents a conversion price of approximately $35.02 per share of common stock. during fiscal year 2014, 2013, and 2012 we made $1.7 million, $2.2 million, and $5.3 million, respectively, in principal payments on long-term debt and capital leases, respectively. revolving credit arrangements on march 12, 2014, we entered into a $300 million revolving unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of lenders that matures on march 12, 2019. the facility includes an option for us to, subject to certain requirements, request an increase in the facility of up to an additional $200 million, for a potential total commitment of $500 million. proceeds from the credit facility can be used for general corporate purposes. interest on amounts borrowed under the credit facility is, at our option, based on (i) a base rate, defined as the greatest of (a) prime rate, (b) federal funds rate plus 0.5%, or (c) one-month libor plus 1.0%, plus a spread of 0.0% to 0.5% or (ii) libor plus a spread of 0.9% to 1.5%, in each case the applicable spread is determined based on the rating of our non-credit enhanced, senior unsecured long-term debt. principal, and any accrued and unpaid interest, is due and payable upon maturity. additionally, we will pay the lenders a quarterly commitment fee that varies based on our rating described above. the credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants including maintaining a consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio of no more than 0.5 to 1.0 and maintaining unrestricted or unencumbered cash and investments, of no less than $1.0 billion. as of june 29, 2014, we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and were in compliance with all financial covenants. other guarantees we have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors for taxes and general liability under some of our agreements. we have entered into certain insurance contracts that may limit our exposure to such indemnifications. as of june 29, 2014, we had not recorded any liability on our consolidated financial statements in connection with these indemnifications, as we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that we will pay any amounts under these guarantees. 44 generally, we indemnify, under pre-determined conditions and limitations, our customers for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by our products or services. we seek to limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products or services subject to its indemnification obligations. we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that we will pay any material amounts under these guarantees. we provide guarantees and standby letters of credit to certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated during the ordinary course of business. as of june 29, 2014, the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these arrangements and letters of credit was $20.6 million. we do not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid.\"\"\"\n\nInstruction:\nIdentify and extract sentences or phrases that are directly or

IT capability is a firm's ability to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure IT resources in support and enhancement of business strategies and work processes. we focus on information management capability—that is, the ability to provide data and information to users with the appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access and the ability to tailor these in response to changing business needs and directions. at its core, the notion of it capability underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying it-based resources in combination with, and leveraging the value of, other resources and capabilities. it capability, broadly defined as the it function’s competence to effectively support business needs, has become a key in transforming a firm into a competitive force. a firm’s it capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible it resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, business process understanding and human resources to further organizational goals.\"\"\"\n\nText:\n\"\"\"item 1a. risk factors in addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations (including revenues and profitability) and/or stock price. our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that may broadly affect companies, including us. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price. our results of operations could be adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients' businesses and levels of business activity. global macroeconomic conditions affect our clients' businesses and the markets they serve. volatile, negative or uncertain economic conditions in our significant markets have undermined and could in the future undermine business confidence in our significant markets or in other markets, which are increasingly interdependent, and cause our clients to reduce or defer their spending on new initiatives and technologies, or may result in clients reducing, delaying or eliminating spending under existing contracts with us, which would negatively affect our business. growth in the markets we serve could be at a slow rate, or could stagnate or contract, in each case, for an extended period of time. differing economic conditions and patterns of economic growth and contraction in the geographical regions in which we operate and the industries we serve have affected and may in the future affect demand for our services. a material portion of our revenues and profitability is derived from our clients in north america and europe. weak demand or a slower than expected recovery in these markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. in addition, because we operate globally and have significant businesses in markets outside of north america and europe, an economic slowdown in one or more of those other markets could adversely affect our results of operations as well. ongoing economic volatility and uncertainty and changing demand patterns affect our business in a number of other ways, including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand and effectively build our revenue and resource plans, particularly in consulting. economic volatility and uncertainty is particularly challenging because it may take some time for the effects and changes in demand patterns resulting from these and other factors to manifest themselves in our business and results of operations. changing demand patterns from economic volatility and uncertainty could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations. our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing, profitable client demand for our services and solutions, and a significant reduction in such demand could materially affect our results of operations. our revenue and profitability depend on the demand for our services with favorable margins, which could be negatively affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product. as described above, volatile, negative or uncertain global economic conditions and lower growth in the markets we serve have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect client demand for our services and solutions. in addition, as new technologies become available, such as software as a service (saas), which continually change the nature of our business, clients may slow spending on current technologies in anticipation of implementing these new technologies. such a slowdown can negatively impact our results of operations if the pace and level of spending on new technologies is not sufficient to make up any shortfall. developments in the industries we serve, which may be rapid, also could shift demand to new services and solutions. if, as a result of new technologies or changes in the industries we serve, our clients demand new services and solutions, we may be less competitive in these new areas or need to make significant investment to meet that demand. companies in the industries we serve sometimes seek to achieve economies of scale and other synergies by combining with or acquiring other companies. if one of our current clients merges or consolidates with a company that relies on another provider for its consulting, systems integration and technology, or outsourcing services, we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work if we are not successful in generating 9 new opportunities from the merger or consolidation. at any given time in a particular industry or geography, one or a small number of clients could contribute a significant portion of our revenues, and any decision by such a client to delay, reduce, or eliminate spending on our services and solutions could have a disproportionate impact on the results of operations in the relevant industry and/or geography. many of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration, and these contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days' notice. longer-term, larger and more complex contracts, such as the majority of our outsourcing contracts, generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us, but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated ongoing revenues and profits lost upon termination of the contract. many of our contracts allow clients to terminate, or delay, reduce or eliminate spending on the services and solutions we provide. additionally, a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project, try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work. when contracts are terminated or not renewed, we lose the anticipated revenues, and it may take significant time to replace the level of revenues lost. consequently, our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected. the specific business or financial condition of a client, changes in management and changes in a client's strategy also are all factors that can result in terminations, cancellations or delays. if we are unable to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, our business, the utilization rate of our professionals and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected. our success is dependent, in large part, on our ability to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and our ability to attract and retain personnel with the knowledge and skills to lead our business globally. experienced personnel in our industry are in high demand, and competition for talent is intense. we must hire, retain and motivate appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve clients across the globe, respond quickly to rapid and ongoing technology, industry and macroeconomic developments and grow and manage our business. for example, if we are unable to hire or continually train our employees to keep pace with the rapid and continuing changes in technology and the industries we serve or changes in the types of services clients are demanding, such as the increase in demand for outsourcing services, we may not be able to develop and deliver new services and solutions to fulfill client demand. as we expand our services and solutions, we must also hire and retain an increasing number of professionals with different skills and professional expectations than those of the professionals we have historically hired and retained. additionally, if we are unable to successfully integrate, motivate and retain these professionals, our ability to continue to secure work in those industries and for our services and solutions may suffer. we are particularly dependent on retaining members of accenture leadership and other experienced managers, and if we are unable to do so, our ability to develop new business and effectively lead our current projects could be jeopardized. we depend on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide leadership and direction for our businesses. this includes developing talent and leadership capabilities in emerging markets, where the depth of skilled employees is often limited and competition for these resources is intense. our ability to expand geographically depends, in large part, on our ability to attract, retain and integrate both leaders for the local business and people with the appropriate skills. similarly, our profitability depends on our ability to effectively utilize personnel with the right mix of skills and experience to perform services for our clients, including our ability to transition employees to new assignments on a timely basis. if we are unable to effectively deploy our employees globally on a timely basis to fulfill the needs of our clients, our ability to perform our work profitably could suffer. if the utilization rate of our professionals is too high, it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition, the quality of the work performed as well as our ability to staff projects. if our utilization rate is too low, our profitability and the engagement of our employees could suffer. the costs associated with recruiting and training employees are significant. an important element of our global business model is the deployment of our employees around the world, which allows us to move talent as needed, particularly in emerging markets. therefore, if we are not able to deploy the talent we need because of increased regulation of immigration or work visas, including limitations placed on the number of visas granted, limitations on the type of work performed or location in which the work can be performed, and new or higher minimum salary requirements, it could be more difficult to staff our employees on client engagements and could increase our costs. our equity-based incentive compensation plans are designed to reward high-performing personnel for their contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us. if the anticipated value of such incentives does not materialize because of volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price, or if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive, our ability to attract and retain the personnel we need could be adversely affected. in addition, if we do not obtain the shareholder approval needed to continue granting equity awards under our share plans in the amounts we believe are necessary, our ability to attract and retain personnel could be negatively affected. there is a risk that at certain points in time, and in certain geographical regions, we will find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current and/or future demand. in these cases, we might need to redeploy existing personnel or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain labor needs, and if not done effectively, our profitability could be negatively impacted. additionally, if demand for our services were to escalate at a high rate, we may need to adjust our compensation practices, which could put upward pressure on our costs and adversely affect our profitability if 10 we are unable to recover these increased costs. at certain times, however, we may also have more personnel than we need in certain skill sets or geographies or at compensation levels that are not aligned with skill sets. in these situations, we have engaged, and may in the future engage, in actions to rebalance our resources, including through reduced levels of new hiring and increased involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand. if we are not successful in these initiatives, our results of operations could be adversely affected. the markets in which we compete are highly competitive, and we might not be able to compete effectively. the markets in which we offer our services are highly competitive. our competitors include: • large multinational providers, including the services arms of large global technology providers (hardware, equipment and software), that offer some or all of the services that we do; • off-shore service providers in lower-cost locations, particularly in india, that offer services globally that are similar to the services we offer, often at highly competitive prices and on more aggressive contractual terms; • accounting firms that have expanded or are in the process of expanding, including through acquisitions, their consulting services in areas that compete with us; • niche solution or service providers or local competitors that compete with us in a specific geographic market, industry segment or service area, including companies that provide new or alternative products, services or delivery models; and • in-house departments of large corporations that use their own resources, rather than engage an outside firm for the types of services we provide. some competitors are companies that may have greater financial, marketing or other resources than we do and, therefore, may be better able to compete for new work and skilled professionals. even if we have potential offerings that address marketplace or client needs, competitors may be more successful at selling similar services they offer, including to companies that are our clients. some competitors are more established in certain markets, and that may make executing our geographic expansion strategy in these markets more challenging. additionally, competitors may also offer more aggressive contractual terms, which may affect our ability to win work. our future performance is largely dependent on our ability to compete successfully in the markets we currently serve, while expanding into additional markets. if we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and clients to competitors, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. in addition, we may face greater competition due to consolidation of companies in the technology sector, through strategic mergers or acquisitions. consolidation activity may result in new competitors with greater scale, a broader footprint or offerings that are more attractive than ours. for example, there has been a trend toward consolidation among hardware manufacturers, software developers and vendors, and service providers, which has resulted in the convergence of products and services. over time, our access to such products and services may be reduced as a result of this consolidation. additionally, vertically integrated companies are able to offer as a single provider more integrated services (software and hardware) to clients than we can in some cases and therefore may represent a more attractive alternative to clients. if buyers of services favor using a single provider for an integrated technology stack, such buyers may direct more business to such competitors, and this could materially adversely affect our competitive position and our results of operations. we could have liability or our reputation could be damaged if we fail to protect client and/or accenture data or information systems as obligated by law or contract or if our information systems are breached. we are dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely process, transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients, alliance partners, and vendors. as the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure continues to grow, including as a result of the use of mobile technologies and social media, the potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks increases. such breaches could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information. in providing services to clients, we often manage, utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or accenture data, including personal data, and we expect these activities to increase. as a result, we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information, such as the national laws implementing the european union directive on data protection and various u.s. federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other personally identifiable information. these laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently and sometimes conflict among the various countries in which we operate. if any person, including any of our employees, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or accenture data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions. these monetary damages might not be subject to a contractual limit of liability or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages and could be significant. unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or accenture data, whether through systems failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients. similarly, unauthorized access 11 to or through our information systems or those we develop for our clients, whether by our employees or third parties, including a cyberattack by computer programmers, hackers, members of organized crime and/or state-sponsored organizations, who may develop and deploy viruses, worms or other malicious software programs, could result in negative publicity, significant remediation costs, legal liability, damage to our reputation and government sanctions and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. in addition, our liability insurance might not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyberattacks and other related breaches. our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if we cannot adapt and expand our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings by new entrants. our success depends on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and industry developments and offerings by new entrants to serve the evolving needs of our clients. current areas of significant change include mobility, cloud-based computing, digital, the processing and analyzing of large amounts of data and saas solutions. technological developments such as these may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients and, in the case of saas solutions, could affect the nature of how our revenue is generated. these technologies, and others that may emerge, could reduce and, over time, replace some of our current business. in addition, clients may delay spending under existing contracts and engagements and may delay entering into new contracts while they evaluate the new technologies. our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation that will enable us to expand our business into new growth areas. if we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and industry developments, or evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale, or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation, our services and solutions, our results of operations, and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and continue to grow could be negatively affected. in addition, we operate in a quickly evolving environment, in which there currently are, and we expect will continue to be, new technology entrants. new services or technologies offered by competitors or new entrants may make our offerings less differentiated or less competitive, when compared to other alternatives, which may adversely affect our results of operations. our results of operations could materially suffer if we are not able to obtain sufficient pricing to enable us to meet our profitability expectations. if we are not able to obtain sufficient pricing for our services, our revenues and profitability could materially suffer. the rates we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors, including: • general economic and political conditions; • the competitive environment in our industry; • our clients' desire to reduce their costs; • our ability to accurately estimate, attain and sustain contract revenues, margins and cash flows over the full contract period, which includes our ability to estimate the impact of inflation and foreign exchange on our margins over long-term contracts; and • procurement practices of clients and their use of third-party advisors. in addition, our profitability with respect to our services and solutions for new technologies may be different when compared to the profitability of our current business, due to factors such as the use of alternative pricing, the mix of work and the number of service providers, among others. for example, in projects involving our saas solutions, revenue is typically generated on a usage basis, which may be more difficult to predict accurately due to our more limited historical data using this new commercial model. the competitive environment in our industry affects our ability to obtain favorable pricing in a number of ways, any of which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations. the less we are able to differentiate our services and solutions and/or clearly convey the value of our services and solutions, the more risk we have that they will be seen as commodities, with price being the driving factor in selecting a service provider. in addition, the introduction of new services or products by competitors could reduce our ability to obtain favorable pricing for the services or products we offer. competitors may be willing, at times, to price contracts lower than us in an effort to enter the market or increase market share. further, if competitors develop and implement methodologies that yield greater efficiency and productivity, they may be better positioned to offer services similar to ours at lower prices. if we do not accurately anticipate the cost, risk and complexity of performing our work or third parties upon whom we rely do not meet their commitments, then our contracts could have delivery inefficiencies and be less profitable than expected or unprofitable. our contract profitability is highly dependent on our forecasts and predictions about the level of effort and cost necessary to deliver our services and solutions, which are based on available data and could turn out to be materially inaccurate. if we do 12 not accurately estimate the effort, costs or timing for meeting our contractual commitments and/or completing projects to a client's satisfaction, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable. our cost and profit margin estimates on our consulting and outsourcing work include anticipated long-term cost savings for the client that we expect to achieve and sustain over the life of the contract. we may fail to accurately assess the risks associated with potential contracts. this could result in existing contracts and contracts entered into in the future being less profitable than expected or unprofitable, which could have an adverse effect on our profitability. similarly, if we experience unanticipated delivery difficulties due to our management, the failure of third parties to meet their commitments or for any other reason, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable. in particular, large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software, systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers, including companies with which we have alliances. our profitability depends on the ability of these subcontractors, vendors and service providers to deliver their products and services in a timely manner and in accordance with the project requirements, as well as on our effective oversight of their performance. some of this work involves new technologies, which may not work as intended or may take more effort to implement than initially predicted. in some cases, these subcontractors are small firms, and they might not have the resources or experience to successfully integrate their services or products with large-scale projects or enterprises. in addition, certain client work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances, some of which require us to assume responsibility for the performance of third parties whom we do not control. any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to perform and subject us to additional liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on relationships with our clients and on our results of operations. our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. although we report our results of operations in u.s. dollars, a majority of our net revenues is denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. because our consolidated financial statements are presented in u.s. dollars, we must translate revenues, expenses and income, as well as assets and liabilities, into u.s. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. therefore, changes in the value of the u.s. dollar against other currencies will affect our net revenues, operating income and the value of balance-sheet items, including intercompany payables and receivables, originally denominated in other currencies. these changes cause our growth in consolidated earnings stated in u.s. dollars to be higher or lower than our growth in local currency when compared against other periods. our currency hedging program, which is designed to partially offset the impact on consolidated earnings related to the changes in value of certain balance sheet items, might not be successful. as we continue to leverage our global delivery model, more of our expenses are incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for the related services. an increase in the value of certain currencies, such as the indian rupee, against the u.s. dollar could increase costs for delivery of services at off-shore sites by increasing labor and other costs that are denominated in local currency. our contractual provisions or cost management efforts might not be able to offset their impact, and our currency hedging activities, which are designed to partially offset this impact, might not be successful. this could result in a decrease in the profitability of our contracts that are utilizing delivery center resources. conversely, a decrease in the value of certain currencies against the u.s. dollar, such as the indian rupee, could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to service providers that benefit to a greater degree from such a decrease and can, as a result, deliver services at a lower cost. in addition, our currency hedging activities are themselves subject to risk. these include risks related to counterparty performance under hedging contracts and risks related to currency fluctuations. we also face risks that extreme economic conditions, political instability, or hostilities or disasters of the type described above could impact or perhaps eliminate the underlying exposures that we are hedging. such an event could lead to losses being recognized on the currency hedges then in place that are not offset by anticipated changes in the underlying hedge exposure. our profitability could suffer if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful, and we may not be able to improve our profitability through improvements to cost-management to the degree we have done in the past. our ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent on our being able to successfully manage our costs. our cost management strategies include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our services and our resource capacity, optimizing the costs of service delivery and maintaining or improving our sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues. we have also taken actions to reduce certain costs, and these initiatives include, without limitation, re-alignment of portions of our workforce to lower-cost locations and the use of involuntary terminations as a means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance. these actions and our other cost-management efforts may not be successful, our efficiency may not be enhanced and we may not achieve desired levels of profitability. over time, we have been successful in managing our general and administrative costs. because of the significant steps taken in the past to manage costs, it may become increasingly difficult to continue to manage our cost structure to the same degree as in the past. if we are not effective in managing our operating costs in response to changes in demand or pricing, or if we are unable to absorb or pass on increases 13 in the compensation of our employees by continuing to move more work to lower-cost locations or otherwise, we may not be able to invest in our business in an amount necessary to achieve our planned rates of growth, we may not be able to reward our people in the manner we believe is necessary to attract or retain personnel at desired levels, and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. our business could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability. we are subject to, and may become a party to, a variety of litigation or other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. our business is subject to the risk of litigation involving current and former employees, clients, alliance partners, subcontractors, suppliers, competitors, shareholders, government agencies or others through private actions, class actions, whistleblower claims, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation. regardless of the merits of the claims, the cost to defend current and future litigation may be significant, and such matters can be time-consuming and divert management's attention and resources. the results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in materially adverse monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us. any claims or litigation, even if fully indemnified or insured, could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance in the future. for example, we could be subject to significant legal liability and litigation expense if we fail to meet our contractual obligations, contribute to internal control deficiencies of a client or otherwise breach obligations to third parties, including clients, alliance partners, employees and former employees, and other parties with whom we conduct business, or if our subcontractors breach or dispute the terms of our agreements with them and impede our ability to meet our obligations to our clients. we may enter into agreements with non-standard terms because we perceive an important economic opportunity or because our personnel did not adequately follow our contracting guidelines. in addition, the contracting practices of competitors, along with the demands of increasingly sophisticated clients, may cause contract terms and conditions that are unfavorable to us to become new standards in the marketplace. we may find ourselves committed to providing services or solutions that we are unable to deliver or whose delivery will reduce our profitability or cause us financial loss. if we cannot or do not meet our contractual obligations and if our potential liability is not adequately limited through the terms of our agreements, liability limitations are not enforced or a third party alleges fraud or other wrongdoing to prevent us from relying upon those contractual protections, we might face significant legal liability and litigation expense and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. in addition, as we expand our services and solutions into new areas, such as taking over the operation of certain portions of our clients' businesses, which increasingly include the operation of functions and systems that are critical to the core businesses of our clients, we may be exposed to additional operational, regulatory or other risks specific to these new areas. a failure of a client's system based on our services or solutions could also subject us to a claim for significant damages that could materially adversely affect our results of operations. while we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities, such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable. even if we believe a claim is covered by insurance, insurers may dispute our entitlement to recovery for a variety of potential reasons, which may affect the timing and, if they prevail, the amount of our recovery. our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment. our clients include national, provincial, state and local governmental entities. our government work carries various risks inherent in the government contracting process. these risks include, but are not limited to, the following: • government entities, particularly in the united states, often reserve the right to audit our contract costs and conduct inquiries and investigations of our business practices with respect to government contracts. u.s. government agencies, including the defense contract audit agency, routinely audit our contract costs, including allocated indirect costs and compliance with the cost accounting standards. these agencies also conduct reviews and investigations and make inquiries regarding our accounting and other systems in connection with our performance and business practices with respect to our government contracts. negative findings from existing and future audits, investigations or inquiries could affect our future sales and profitability by preventing us, by operation of law or in practice, from receiving new government contracts for some period of time. in addition, if the u.s. government concludes that certain costs are not reimbursable, have not been properly determined or are based on outdated estimates of our work, then we will not be allowed to bill for such costs, may have to refund money that has already been paid to us or could be required to retroactively and prospectively adjust previously agreed to billing or pricing rates for our work. negative findings from existing and future audits of our business systems, including our accounting system, may result in the u.s. government preventing us from billing, at least temporarily, a percentage of our costs. as a result of prior negative findings in connection with audits, investigations and inquiries, we have from time to time experienced some of the adverse consequences described above and may in the future experience further adverse consequences, which could materially adversely affect our future results of operations. • if a government client discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations, we may become subject to various civil and criminal penalties, including those under the civil u.s. false claims act, and administrative 14 sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government. the inherent limitations of internal controls may not prevent or detect all improper or illegal activities. • u.s. government contracting regulations impose strict compliance and disclosure obligations. disclosure is required if certain company personnel have knowledge of \"credible evidence\" of a violation of federal criminal laws involving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery or improper gratuity, a violation of the civil u.s. false claims act or receipt of a significant overpayment from the government. failure to make required disclosures could be a basis for suspension and/or debarment from federal government contracting in addition to breach of the specific contract and could also impact contracting beyond the u.s. federal level. reported matters also could lead to audits or investigations and other civil, criminal or administrative sanctions. • government contracts are subject to heightened reputational and contractual risks compared to contracts with commercial clients. for example, government contracts and the proceedings surrounding them are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity. negative publicity, including an allegation of improper or illegal activity, regardless of its accuracy, may adversely affect our reputation. • terms and conditions of government contracts also tend to be more onerous and are often more difficult to negotiate. for example, these contracts often contain high or unlimited liability for breaches and feature less favorable payment terms and sometimes require us to take on liability for the performance of third parties. • government entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies. while these projects are often planned and executed as multi-year projects, government entities usually reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these projects for lack of approved funding and/or at their convenience. changes in government or political developments, including budget deficits, shortfalls or uncertainties, government spending reductions (e.g., congressional sequestration of funds under the budget control act of 2011) or other debt constraints, such as those recently experienced in the united states and europe, could result in our projects being reduced in price or scope or terminated altogether, which also could limit our recovery of incurred costs, reimbursable expenses and profits on work completed prior to the termination. furthermore, if insufficient funding is appropriated to the government entity to cover termination costs, we may not be able to fully recover our investments. • political and economic factors such as pending elections, the outcome of recent elections, changes in leadership among key executive or legislative decision makers, revisions to governmental tax or other policies and reduced tax revenues can affect the number and terms of new government contracts signed or the speed at which new contracts are signed, decrease future levels of spending and authorizations for programs that we bid, shift spending priorities to programs in areas for which we do not provide services and/or lead to changes in enforcement or how compliance with relevant rules or laws is assessed. • legislative and executive proposals remain under consideration or could be proposed in the future, which, if enacted, could limit or even prohibit our eligibility to be awarded state or federal government contracts in the united states in the future or could include requirements that would otherwise affect our results of operations. various u.s. federal and state legislative proposals have been introduced and/or enacted in recent years that deny government contracts to certain u.s. companies that reincorporate or have reincorporated outside the united states. while accenture was not a u.s. company that reincorporated outside the united states, it is possible that these contract bans and other legislative proposals could be applied in a way to negatively affect accenture. the occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our business with the particular government entities involved, but also our business with other entities of the same or other governmental bodies or with certain commercial clients, and could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations. we might not be successful at identifying, acquiring or integrating businesses or entering into joint ventures. we expect to continue pursuing strategic and targeted acquisitions and joint ventures intended to enhance or add to our offerings of services and solutions, or to enable us to expand in certain geographic and other markets. depending on the opportunities available, we may increase the amount of investment in such acquisitions or joint ventures. we may not successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates or joint venture opportunities. we also might not succeed in completing targeted transactions or achieve desired results of operations. furthermore, we face risks in successfully integrating any businesses we might acquire or create through a joint venture. ongoing business may be disrupted, and our management's attention may be diverted by acquisition, transition or integration activities. in addition, we might need to dedicate additional management and other resources, and our organizational structure could make it difficult for us to efficiently integrate acquired businesses into our ongoing operations and assimilate and retain employees of those businesses into our culture and operations. business combination and investment transactions may result in significant costs and expenses and charges to earnings, including those related to severance pay, early retirement costs, employee benefit costs, goodwill and asset impairment charges, assumed litigation and other liabilities, and legal, 15 accounting and financial advisory fees. we may have difficulties as a result of entering into new markets where we have limited or no direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions. we might fail to realize the expected benefits or strategic objectives of any acquisition or joint venture we undertake. we might not achieve our expected return on investment or may lose money. we may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume from a company we acquire or in which we invest, including from that company's known and unknown obligations, intellectual property or other assets, terminated employees, current or former clients, or other third parties, and may fail to identify or adequately assess the magnitude of certain liabilities, shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring, investing in or partnering with a company, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions or liabilities resulting from an acquisition target's previous activities, any of which could result in unexpected legal or regulatory exposure, unfavorable accounting treatment, unexpected increases in taxes or other adverse effects on our business. by their nature, joint ventures involve a lesser degree of control over the business operations of the joint venture itself, particularly when we have a minority position. this lesser degree of control may expose us to additional reputational, financial, legal, compliance or operational risks. litigation, indemnification claims and other unforeseen claims and liabilities may arise from the acquisition or operation of acquired businesses. for example, we may face litigation or other claims as a result of certain terms and conditions of the acquisition agreement, such as earnout payments or closing net asset adjustments. alternatively, shareholder litigation may arise as a result of proposed acquisitions. if we are unable to complete the number and kind of acquisition and joint ventures for which we plan, or if we are inefficient or unsuccessful at integrating any acquired businesses into our operations, we may not be able to achieve our planned rates of growth or improve our market share, profitability or competitive position in specific markets or services. our global delivery network is increasingly concentrated in india and the philippines, which may expose us to operational risks. our business model is dependent on our global delivery network, which includes accenture personnel based at more than 50 delivery centers around the world. while these delivery centers are located throughout the world, we have based large portions of our delivery network in india, where we have the largest number of people in our delivery network located, and the philippines, where we have the second largest number of people located. concentrating our global delivery network in these locations presents a number of operational risks, many of which are beyond our control. for example, natural disasters of the type described above, some of which india and the philippines have experienced and other countries may experience, could impair the ability of our people to safely travel to and work in our facilities and disrupt our ability to perform work through our delivery centers. additionally, both india and the philippines have experienced, and other countries may experience, political instability and worker strikes. india in particular has experienced civil unrest and hostilities with neighboring countries, including pakistan. military activity or civil hostilities in the future, as well as terrorist activities and other conditions, which are described more fully above, could significantly disrupt our ability to perform work through our delivery centers. our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective, particularly if catastrophic events occur. if any of these circumstances occurs, we have a greater risk that the interruptions in communications with our clients and other accenture locations and personnel, and any down-time in important processes we operate for clients, could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation in the marketplace. changes in our level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in our treatment as an irish company, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. we are subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. we calculate and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. tax accounting often involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. tax authorities have disagreed, and may in the future disagree, with our judgments, or may take increasingly aggressive positions opposing the judgments we make. we regularly assess the likely outcomes of our audits to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities. however, our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits, and the amounts ultimately paid could be different from the amounts previously recorded. in addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by the expiration of current tax benefits, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws. tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate may change as a result of macroeconomic or other factors outside of our control. in addition, changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, may be unpredictable, particularly in less developed markets, and could become more stringent, which could materially adversely affect our tax position. for example, a number of countries where we do business, including the united states and many countries in the european union, are considering changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to multinational corporations. any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations and financial condition. although we expect to be able to rely on the tax treaty between the united states and ireland, legislative or diplomatic action could be taken that would prevent us from being able to rely on such treaty. our inability to rely on such treaty would subject us to increased taxation or significant additional expense. congressional proposals could change the definition of a u.s. person for u.s. federal income tax purposes, which could subject us to increased taxation. in addition, we could be materially adversely affected by future changes in tax law or policy in ireland or other jurisdictions where we operate, including their treaties with 16 ireland or the united states. these changes could be exacerbated by economic, budget or other challenges facing ireland or these other jurisdictions. as a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue geographic expansion, we are more susceptible to certain risks. we have offices and operations in more than 200 cities in 56 countries around the world. one aspect of our growth strategy is to continue to expand in key markets around the world. our growth strategy might not be successful. if we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations and geographic expansion strategy, including international hostilities, natural disasters, security breaches, failure to maintain compliance with our clients' control requirements and multiple legal and regulatory systems, our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected. in addition, emerging markets generally involve greater financial and operational risks, such as those described below, than our more mature markets. negative or uncertain political climates in countries or geographies where we operate could also adversely affect us. we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies. in some countries, we could be subject to strict restrictions on the movement of cash and the exchange of foreign currencies, which would limit our ability to use this cash across our global operations. this risk could increase as we continue our geographic expansion in key markets around the world, which include emerging markets that are more likely to impose these restrictions than more established markets. international hostilities, terrorist activities, natural disasters, pandemics and infrastructure disruptions could prevent us from effectively serving our clients and thus adversely affect our results of operations. acts of terrorist violence; political unrest; armed regional and international hostilities and international responses to these hostilities; natural disasters, volcanic eruptions, floods and other severe weather conditions; global health emergencies or pandemics or the threat of or perceived potential for these events; and other acts of god could have a negative impact on us. these events could adversely affect our clients' levels of business activity and precipitate sudden and significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles. these events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world, whether the facilities are ours or those of our alliance partners or clients. by disrupting communications and travel and increasing the difficulty of obtaining and retaining highly skilled and qualified personnel, these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver services to our clients. extended disruptions of electricity, other public utilities or network services at our facilities, as well as system failures at, or security breaches in, our facilities or systems, could also adversely affect our ability to serve our clients. we might be unable to protect our people, facilities and systems against all such occurrences. we generally do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks, conflicts and wars. if these disruptions prevent us from effectively serving our clients, our results of operations could be adversely affected. our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements, and violation of these regulations could harm our business. we are subject to numerous, and sometimes conflicting, legal regimes on matters as diverse as anticorruption, import/export controls, content requirements, trade restrictions, tariffs, taxation, sanctions, immigration, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation, anti-competition, data privacy and protection, wage-and-hour standards, and employment and labor relations. the global nature of our operations, including emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or understood by us, and the diverse nature of our operations across a number of regulated industries, further increase the difficulty of compliance. compliance with diverse legal requirements is costly, time-consuming and requires significant resources. violations of one or more of these regulations in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines, criminal sanctions against us and/or our employees, prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation. violations of these regulations in connection with the performance of our obligations to our clients also could result in liability for significant monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage and restrictions on our ability to effectively carry out our contractual obligations and thereby expose us to potential claims from our clients. due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate, local laws may not be well developed or provide sufficiently clear guidance and may be insufficient to protect our rights. in particular, in many parts of the world, including countries in which we operate and/or seek to expand, practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption laws, or regulations, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act 2010. our employees, subcontractors, agents, alliance or joint venture partners, the companies we acquire and their employees, subcontractors and agents, and other third parties with which we associate, could take actions that violate policies or procedures designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance or applicable anticorruption laws or regulations. violations of these laws or regulations by us, our employees or any of these third parties could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions (whether or not we participated or knew about the actions leading to the violations), including fines or penalties, disgorgement of profits and suspension or disqualification from work, including u.s. federal contracting, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, including our results of operations and our reputation. changes in laws and regulations could also mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions or could impose additional taxes on our services and solutions. for example, changes in laws and regulations to 17 limit using off-shore resources in connection with our work or to penalize companies that use off-shore resources, which have been proposed from time to time in various jurisdictions, could adversely affect our results of operations. such changes may result in contracts being terminated or work being transferred on-shore, resulting in greater costs to us. in addition, these changes could have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future work from government clients. adverse changes to our relationships with key alliance partners or in the business of our key alliance partners could adversely affect our results of operations. we have alliances with companies whose capabilities complement our own. a very significant portion of our services and solutions are based on technology or software provided by a few major providers that are our alliance partners. see \"business-alliances.\" the priorities and objectives of our alliance partners may differ from ours. as most of our alliance relationships are non-exclusive, our alliance partners are not prohibited from competing with us or forming closer or preferred arrangements with our competitors. one or more of our key alliance partners may be acquired by a competitor, or key alliance partners might merge with each other, either of which could reduce our access over time to the technology or software provided by those partners. in addition, our alliance partners could experience reduced demand for their technology or software, including, for example, in response to changes in technology, which could lessen related demand for our services. if we do not obtain the expected benefits from our alliance relationships for any reason, we may be less competitive, our ability to offer attractive solutions to our clients may be negatively affected, and our results of operations could be adversely affected. our services or solutions could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we might lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others. we cannot be sure that our services and solutions, including, for example, our software solutions, or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients, do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and these third parties could claim that we or our clients are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. these claims could harm our reputation, cause us to incur substantial costs or prevent us from offering some services or solutions in the future. any related proceedings could require us to expend significant resources over an extended period of time. in most of our contracts, we agree to indemnify our clients for expenses and liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties. in some instances, the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenues we receive from the client. any claims or litigation in this area could be time-consuming and costly, damage our reputation and/or require us to incur additional costs to obtain the right to continue to offer a service or solution to our clients. if we cannot secure this right at all or on reasonable terms, or we cannot substitute alternative technology, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. the risk of infringement claims against us may increase as we expand our industry software solutions and continue to develop and license our software to multiple clients. additionally, in recent years, individuals and firms have purchased intellectual property assets in order to assert claims of infringement against technology providers and customers that use such technology. any such action naming us or our clients could be costly to defend or lead to an expensive settlement or judgment against us. moreover, such an action could result in an injunction being ordered against our client or our own services or operations, causing further damages. in addition, we rely on third-party software in providing some of our services and solutions. if we lose our ability to continue using such software for any reason, including because it is found to infringe the rights of others, we will need to obtain substitute software or seek alternative means of obtaining the technology necessary to continue to provide such services and solutions. our inability to replace such software, or to replace such software in a timely or cost-effective manner, could materially adversely affect our results of operations. if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties, our business could be adversely affected. our success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property. existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights, and the protection in some countries may be very limited. we rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements, and patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. these laws are subject to change at any time and could further limit our ability to protect our intellectual property. there is uncertainty concerning the scope of available intellectual property protection for software and business methods, which are fields in which we rely on intellectual property laws to protect our rights. our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from reverse engineering our proprietary information or independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative of ours. further, the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors, former employees or other third parties, and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. enforcing our rights might also require considerable time, money and oversight, and we may not be successful in enforcing our rights. 18 our ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace. we believe the accenture brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services from those of competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees. however, our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with clients, information technology security breaches or service outages, internal control deficiencies, delivery failures or compliance violations. similarly, our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former clients, directors, employees, competitors, vendors, alliance partners, our joint ventures or joint venture partners, adversaries in legal proceedings, legislators or government regulators, as well as members of the investment community or the media. there is a risk that negative information about accenture, even if based on rumor or misunderstanding, could adversely affect our business. damage to our reputation could be difficult, expensive and time-consuming to repair, could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements, resulting in a loss of business, and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts. damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the accenture brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us, materially adversely affecting our share price. many of our contracts include payments that link some of our fees to the attainment of performance or business targets and/or require us to meet specific service levels. this could increase the variability of our revenues and impact our margins. many of our contracts include clauses that tie our compensation to the achievement of agreed-upon performance standards or milestones. if we fail to satisfy these measures, it could significantly reduce or eliminate our fees under the contracts, increase the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones, delay expected payments or subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms. clients also often have the right to terminate a contract and pursue damage claims under the contract for serious or repeated failure to meet these service commitments. we also have a number of contracts, in both outsourcing and consulting, in which a portion of our compensation depends on performance measures such as cost-savings, revenue enhancement, benefits produced, business goals attained and adherence to schedule. these goals can be complex and may depend on our clients' actual levels of business activity or may be based on assumptions that are later determined not to be achievable or accurate. these provisions could increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on those contracts. if we are unable to collect our receivables or unbilled services, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. our business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed. we evaluate the financial condition of our clients and usually bill and collect on relatively short cycles. in limited circumstances, we also extend financing to our clients. we have established allowances for losses of receivables and unbilled services. actual losses on client balances could differ from those that we currently anticipate, and, as a result, we might need to adjust our allowances. we might not accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients. macroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties for our clients, including bankruptcy and insolvency. this could cause clients to delay payments to us, request modifications to their payment arrangements that could increase our receivables balance, or default on their payment obligations to us. in addition, in certain geographies and industries, some clients have requested longer payment terms, which has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our cash flows. recovery of client financing and timely collection of client balances also depend on our ability to complete our contractual commitments and bill and collect our contracted revenues. if we are unable to meet our contractual requirements, we might experience delays in collection of and/or be unable to collect our client balances, and if this occurs, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. in addition, if we experience an increase in the time to bill and collect for our services, our cash flows could be adversely affected. if we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size, we might be unable to achieve our business objectives. as of august 31, 2014, we had more than 305,000 employees worldwide. our size and scale present significant management and organizational challenges. it might become increasingly difficult to maintain effective standards across a large enterprise and effectively institutionalize our knowledge. it might also become more difficult to maintain our culture, effectively manage and monitor our personnel and operations and effectively communicate our core values, policies and procedures, strategies and goals, particularly given our world-wide operations. the size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that we will have employees who engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity, or otherwise expose us to unacceptable business risks, despite our efforts to train them and maintain internal controls to prevent such instances. for example, employee misconduct could involve the improper use of our clients' sensitive or confidential information or the failure to comply with legislation or regulations regarding the protection of sensitive or confidential information. furthermore, the inappropriate use of social networking sites by our employees could result in breaches of confidentiality, unauthorized disclosure of non-public company information or damage to our reputation. if we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise and instill our culture and core values into all of our employees, our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired. in addition, from time to time, we have made, and may continue to make, changes to our operating model, 19 including how we are organized, as the needs and size of our business change, and if we do not successfully implement the changes, our business and results of operation may be negatively impacted. our share price and results of operations could fluctuate and be difficult to predict. our share price has fluctuated in the past and could continue to fluctuate in the future in response to various factors. these factors include: • changes in macroeconomic or political factors unrelated to our business; • general or industry-specific market conditions or changes in financial markets; • our failure to meet our growth and financial objectives, including with respect to our overall revenue growth, operating margin expansion and earnings per share growth; • our ability to generate enough free cash flow to return cash to our shareholders at historical levels or levels expected by our shareholders; • announcements by us or competitors about developments in our business or prospects; and • projections or speculation about our business or that of competitors by the media or investment analysts. our results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future, making them difficult to predict. some of the factors that could cause our results of operations to vary include: • the business decisions of our clients to begin to curtail or reduce the use of our services, including in response to changes in macroeconomic or political conditions unrelated to our business, general market conditions and new technologies; • periodic differences between our clients' estimated and actual levels of business activity associated with ongoing work, as well as the stage of completion of existing projects and/or their termination or restructuring; • changes in our pricing or competitors' pricing; • our ability to manage costs, including those for our own or subcontracted personnel, travel, support services and severance; • contract delivery inefficiencies, such as those due to poor delivery or changes in forecasts; • currency exchange rate fluctuations; • our ability to transition employees quickly from completed to new projects and maintain an appropriate headcount in each of our workforces; • changes in estimates, accruals or payments of variable compensation to our employees; • seasonality, including number of workdays and holiday and summer vacations; • acquisition, integration and operational costs related to businesses acquired; • the introduction of new products or services by us, competitors or alliance partners; • changes in, or the application of changes in, accounting principles or pronouncements under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles, particularly those related to revenue recognition; and • global, regional and local economic and political conditions and related risks, including acts of terrorism. as a result of any of the above factors, or any of the other risks described in this item 1a, \"risk factors,\" our share price could be difficult to predict, and our share price in the past might not be a good indicator of the price of our shares in the future. in addition, if litigation is instituted against us following declines in our share price, we might need to devote substantial time and resources to responding to the litigation, and our share price could be materially adversely affected. our results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls. the accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls. we are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls. internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including human error, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions, and fraud. because of these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud. if we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use, we could suffer harm to our reputation, fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis, be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations, or be required to restate our financial statements, and our results of operations, the market price of our securities and our ability to obtain new business could be materially adversely affected. 20 we make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our financial results. our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. the application of generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that affect our reported financial condition, and our accompanying disclosure with respect to, among other things, revenue recognition and income taxes. we base our estimates on historical experience, contractual commitments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made. these estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment and are subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. if our estimates, or the assumptions underlying such estimates, are not correct, actual results may differ materially from our estimates, and we may need to, among other things, adjust revenues or accrue additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations. we are incorporated in ireland and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the united states. as a result, it might not be possible for shareholders to enforce civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the united states. we may also be subject to criticism and negative publicity related to our incorporation in ireland. we are organized under the laws of ireland, and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the united states. a shareholder who obtains a court judgment based on the civil liability provisions of u.s. federal or state securities laws may be unable to enforce the judgment against us in ireland or in countries other than the united states where we have assets. in addition, there is some doubt as to whether the courts of ireland and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of u.s. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the united states or would hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. we have been advised that the united states and ireland do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. the laws of ireland do, however, as a general rule, provide that the judgments of the courts of the united states have the same validity in ireland as if rendered by irish courts. certain important requirements must be satisfied before the irish courts will recognize the u.s. judgment. the originating court must have been a court of competent jurisdiction, the judgment must be final and conclusive and the judgment may not be recognized if it was obtained by fraud or its recognition would be contrary to irish public policy. any judgment obtained in contravention of the rules of natural justice or that is irreconcilable with an earlier foreign judgment would not be enforced in ireland. similarly, judgments might not be enforceable in countries other than the united states where we have assets. some companies that conduct substantial business in the united states but which have a parent domiciled in certain other jurisdictions have been criticized as improperly avoiding u.s. taxes or creating an unfair competitive advantage over other u.s. companies. accenture never conducted business under a u.s. parent company and pays u.s. taxes on all of its u.s. operations. nonetheless, we could be subject to criticism in connection with our incorporation in ireland. irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and might afford less protection to shareholders. our shareholders could have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the united states. as an irish company, we are governed by the companies acts 1963 to 2013 of ireland (the \"companies acts\"). the companies acts differ in some significant, and possibly material, respects from laws applicable to u.s. corporations and shareholders under various state corporation laws, including the provisions relating to interested directors, mergers and acquisitions, takeovers, shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors. under irish law, the duties of directors and officers of a company are generally owed to the company only. shareholders of irish companies do not generally have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company under irish law, and may only do so in limited circumstances. directors of an irish company must, in exercising their powers and performing their duties, act with due care and skill, honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company. directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests might conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any contract or arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries. if a director or officer of an irish company is found to have breached his duties to that company, he could be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty. under irish law, we must have authority from our shareholders to issue any shares, including shares that are part of the company's authorized but unissued share capital. in addition, unless otherwise authorized by its shareholders, when an irish company issues shares for cash to new shareholders, it is required first to offer those shares on the same or more favorable terms to existing shareholders on a pro-rata basis. if we are unable to obtain these authorizations from our shareholders, or are otherwise limited by the terms of our authorizations, our ability to issue shares under our equity compensation plans and, if applicable, to facilitate funding acquisitions or otherwise raise capital could be adversely affected. 21 we might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all. if we raise equity capital, it may dilute our shareholders' ownership interest in us. we might choose to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to: • take advantage of opportunities, including more rapid expansion; • acquire other businesses or assets; • repurchase shares from our shareholders; • develop new services and solutions; or • respond to competitive pressures. any additional capital raised through the sale of equity could dilute shareholders' ownership percentage in us. furthermore, any additional financing we need might not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. this discussion and analysis also contains forward-looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the disclosures and information contained in \"disclosure regarding forward-looking statements\" and \"risk factors\" in this annual report on form 10-k. we use the terms \"accenture,\" \"we,\" the \"company,\" \"our\" and \"us\" in this report to refer to accenture plc and its subsidiaries. all references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on august 31. for example, a reference to \"fiscal 2014\" means the 12-month period that ended on august 31, 2014. all references to quarters, unless otherwise noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year. we use the term \"in local currency\" so that certain financial results may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. financial results \"in local currency\" are calculated by restating current period activity into u.s. dollars using the comparable prior year period's foreign currency exchange rates. this approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the u.s. dollar. overview revenues are driven by the ability of our executives to secure new contracts and to deliver solutions and services that add value relevant to our clients' current needs and challenges. the level of revenues we achieve is based on our ability to deliver market-leading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis. our results of operations are affected by economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions and levels of business confidence. there continues to be volatility and economic and geopolitical uncertainty in certain markets around the world, as well as lower levels of spending on some of the types of services we provide, all of which may impact our business. we continue to monitor the impact of this volatility and uncertainty and seek to manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions. revenues before reimbursements (\"net revenues\") for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 were $7.78 billion, compared with $7.09 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, an increase of 10% in u.s. dollars and 8% in local currency. net revenues for fiscal 2014 were $30.00 billion, compared with $28.56 billion for fiscal 2013, an increase of 5% in both u.s. dollars and local currency. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, communications, media & technology, products, health & public service and financial services experienced year-over-year revenue growth in local currency, while resources was flat year-over-year in local currency. revenue growth in local currency was very strong in outsourcing and modest in consulting during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. clients continue to request a higher volume of outsourcing services, place a greater emphasis on cost savings initiatives and manage the pace and level of spending on existing consulting and outsourcing contracts. the business environment remains competitive and, in the first half of fiscal 2014, we experienced pricing pressures. we use the term \"pricing\" to mean the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell. in our consulting business, net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 were $4.02 billion, compared with $3.80 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, an increase of 6% in u.s. dollars and 4% in local currency. net consulting revenues for fiscal 2014 were $15.74 billion, compared with $15.38 billion for fiscal 2013, an increase of 2% in u.s. dollars and 3% in local currency. clients continued to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to integrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses. we continue to experience growing demand for our services in emerging technologies, including digital services (digital marketing, analytics and mobility) and cloud computing. compared to fiscal 2013, we continued to provide a greater proportion of systems integration consulting through use of lower-cost resources in our global delivery network. this trend has resulted in work volume growing faster than revenue, and we expect this trend to continue. in our outsourcing business, net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 were $3.76 billion, compared with $3.28 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, an increase of 15% in u.s. dollars and 13% in local currency. net outsourcing revenues for fiscal 2014 were $14.26 billion, compared with $13.18 billion for fiscal 2013, an increase of 8% in both u.s. dollars and local currency. clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations to improve effectiveness and save costs. compared to fiscal 2013, we continued to provide a greater proportion of application outsourcing through use of lower-cost resources in our global delivery network. as we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations. if the u.s. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues and revenue growth in u.s. dollars may be lower. if the u.s. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues and revenue growth in u.s. dollars may be higher. when compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, the u.s. dollar weakened against many currencies during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, resulting in favorable currency translation and u.s. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 1% higher than our revenue growth in 28 local currency. when compared to fiscal 2013, there was no aggregate foreign currency translation impact during fiscal 2014, resulting in u.s. dollar revenue growth that was the same as our revenue growth in local currency. the primary categories of operating expenses include cost of services, sales and marketing and general and administrative costs. cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll outsourcing costs. cost of services as a percentage of revenues is driven by the prices we obtain for our solutions and services, the utilization of our client-service personnel and the level of non-payroll costs associated with outsourcing contracts. utilization primarily represents the percentage of our consulting professionals' time spent on chargeable work. utilization for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 was approximately 88%, flat with the third quarter of fiscal 2014 and within our target range. this level of utilization reflects continued strong demand for resources in our global delivery network and in most countries. we continue to hire to meet current and projected future demand. we proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. based on current and projected future demand, we have increased our headcount, the majority of which serve our clients, to more than 305,000 as of august 31, 2014, compared with approximately 293,000 as of may 31, 2014 and approximately 275,000 as of august 31, 2013. the year-over-year increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our services, primarily those delivered through our global delivery network in lower-cost locations, as well as headcount added in connection with acquisitions. annualized attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 was 15%, up from 14% in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 and 12% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. we evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand. in addition, we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees, and we may need to continue to adjust compensation in the future. for the majority of our personnel, compensation increases for fiscal 2014 became effective september 1, 2013. we strive to adjust pricing and/or the mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our gross margin. our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts of services clients are demanding, such as the increase in demand for various outsourcing and emerging technology services; recover increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees. gross margin (net revenues less cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of net revenues) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 was 31.7%, compared with 33.2% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. gross margin for fiscal 2014 was 32.3%, compared with 32.9% for fiscal 2013. there were several factors affecting cost of services and gross margin during fiscal 2014. we experienced lower consulting and outsourcing contract profitability compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to pricing pressures in the first half of fiscal 2014 and higher payroll costs as we did not fully absorb the impact of compensation increases and/or rebalance the mix of resources. in addition, we experienced lower margins in the early stages of a few large contracts. while we accrued significant variable compensation during fiscal 2014, the amounts accrued are lower than fiscal 2013 and partially offset the impacts noted above. sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 17.9% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, compared with 19.3% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. sales and marketing and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 18.0% for fiscal 2014, compared with 18.6% for fiscal 2013. sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business-development activities; investment in offerings; marketing-and advertising-related activities; and acquisition-related costs. general and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems and office space. we continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate. for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013, sales and marketing and general and administrative costs each decreased 30 basis points as a percentage of net revenues. operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 was $1,079 million, compared with $984 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. operating income for fiscal 2014 was $4,301 million, compared with $4,339 million for fiscal 2013. operating margin (operating income as a percentage of net revenues) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 was 13.9%, flat with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. operating margin for fiscal 2014 was 14.3%, compared with 15.2% for fiscal 2013. we recorded reorganization benefits of $274 million during fiscal 2013 which increased operating margin by 100 basis points. excluding the effects of the reorganization benefits, operating margin for fiscal 2013 would have been 14.2%. the effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was 26.1%, compared with 18.1% for fiscal 2013. the above noted reorganization benefits recorded during fiscal 2013 increased income before income taxes without any increase in income tax expense. in addition, during fiscal 2013, we recorded a benefit of $243 million related to settlements of u.s. federal tax audits for fiscal years 2006 through 2009. absent these items, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 would have been 25.3%. diluted earnings per share were $4.52 for fiscal 2014, compared with $4.93 for fiscal 2013, which included $0.72 in benefits from final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities and reductions in reorganization liabilities. excluding these benefits, diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2013 would have been $4.21. 29 our operating income and earnings per share are also affected by currency exchange-rate fluctuations on revenues and costs. most of our costs are incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues. where practical, we also seek to manage foreign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related net revenues, such as the cost of our global delivery network, by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging programs. we seek to manage our costs taking into consideration the residual positive and negative effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on those costs. for more information on our hedging programs, see note 8 (derivative financial instruments) to our consolidated financial statements under item 8, \"financial statements and supplementary data.\" bookings and backlog new bookings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 were $8.33 billion, with consulting bookings of $3.95 billion and outsourcing bookings of $4.38 billion. new bookings for fiscal 2014 were $35.88 billion, with consulting bookings of $17.15 billion and outsourcing bookings of $18.73 billion. we provide information regarding our new bookings, which include new contracts, including those acquired through acquisitions, as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts, because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time. new bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts. the types of services clients are demanding and the pace and level of their spending may impact the conversion of new bookings to revenues. for example, outsourcing bookings, which are typically for multi-year contracts, generally convert to revenue over a longer period of time compared to consulting bookings. information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time. new bookings involve estimates and judgments. there are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings. we do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years. new bookings are recorded using then-existing foreign currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. the majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice, and some without notice. accordingly, we do not believe it is appropriate to characterize bookings attributable to these contracts as backlog. normally, if a client terminates a project, the client remains obligated to pay for commitments we have made to third parties in connection with the project, services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred by us through the date of termination. critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. we continually evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience. because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. these include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes. 30 revenue recognition our contracts have different terms based on the scope, deliverables and complexity of the engagement, the terms of which frequently require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenues. we have many types of contracts, including time-and-materials contracts, fixed-price contracts and contracts with features of both of these contract types. in addition, some contracts include incentives related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts. we conduct rigorous reviews prior to signing such contracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable. we recognize revenues from technology integration consulting contracts using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, which involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract. our contracts for technology integration consulting services generally span six months to two years. estimated revenues used in applying the percentage-of-completion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable. this method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made. estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and estimated costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses. such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified. if our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable. contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated total direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in cost of services and classified in other accrued liabilities. revenues from contracts for non-technology integration consulting services with fees based on time and materials or cost-plus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned. we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. in such contracts, our efforts, measured by time incurred, typically are provided in less than a year and represent the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. for non-technology integration consulting contracts with fixed fees, we recognize revenues as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, provided the billable amounts are not contingent, are consistent with the services delivered and are earned. contingent or incentive revenues relating to non-technology integration consulting contracts are recognized when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned. outsourcing contracts typically span several years and involve complex delivery, often through multiple workforces in different countries. in a number of these arrangements, we hire client employees and become responsible for certain client obligations. revenues are recognized on outsourcing contracts as amounts become billable in accordance with contract terms, unless the amounts are billed in advance of performance of services, in which case revenues are recognized when the services are performed and amounts are earned. revenues from time-and-materials or cost-plus contracts are recognized as the services are performed. in such contracts, our effort, measured by time incurred, represents the contractual milestones or output measure, which is the contractual earnings pattern. revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output. revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis, unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. outsourcing contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients. revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude the amounts are earned. we continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability. circumstances that potentially affect profitability over the life of the contract include decreases in volumes of transactions or other inputs/outputs on which we are paid, failure to deliver agreed benefits, variances from planned internal/external costs to deliver our services and other factors affecting revenues and costs. costs related to delivering outsourcing services are expensed as incurred, with the exception of certain transition costs related to the set-up of processes, personnel and systems, which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. the deferred costs are specific internal costs or incremental external costs directly related to transition or set-up activities necessary to enable the outsourced services. generally, deferred amounts are protected in the event of early termination of the contract and are monitored regularly for impairment. impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets. amounts billable to the client for transition or set-up activities are deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period outsourcing services are provided. contract acquisition and origination costs are expensed as incurred. we enter into contracts that may consist of multiple elements. these contracts may include any combination of technology integration consulting services, non-technology integration consulting services or outsourcing services described above. revenues for contracts with multiple elements are allocated based on the lesser of the element's relative selling price or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another element. the selling price of each element is determined by obtaining third party evidence of fair value of each element and is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately by the company on a regular basis and not as part of a contract with multiple elements. if the amount of non-contingent revenues allocated to a delivered 31 element accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting is less than the costs to deliver such services, then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become non-contingent. revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate elements when the services have value on a stand-alone basis, selling price of the separate elements exists and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element, performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in our control. while determining fair value and identifying separate elements require judgment, generally fair value and the separate elements are readily identifiable as we also sell those elements unaccompanied by other elements. revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as unbilled services. billings in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as deferred revenues until revenue recognition criteria are met. client prepayments (even if nonrefundable) are deferred and recognized over future periods as services are delivered or performed. our consulting revenues are affected by the number of work days in a fiscal quarter, which in turn is affected by the level of vacation days and holidays. consequently, since our first and third quarters typically have approximately 5-10% more work days than our second and fourth quarters, our consulting revenues are typically higher in our first and third quarters than in our second and fourth quarters. net revenues include the margin earned on computer hardware, software and related services resale contracts, as well as revenues from alliance agreements, neither of which is material to us. reimbursements include billings for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses and third-party costs, such as the cost of hardware, software and related services resales. in addition, reimbursements may include allocations from gross billings to record an amount equivalent to reimbursable costs, where billings do not specifically identify reimbursable expenses. we report revenues net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions. income taxes determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment. deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates, are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities. as a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. this involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets. tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly. factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, tax planning strategies and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located. valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors. changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate. we apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. in accordance with fasb guidance on uncertainty in income taxes, a change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs. in the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs. no taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested. if future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements, necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for taxes may apply, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate. we currently do not foresee any event that would require us to distribute these earnings. as a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities, and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes. we establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets for uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged. in evaluating a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences, judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions. the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. we evaluate these uncertain tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations. we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable. however, final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities 32 and historical income tax provisions. the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made. we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for uncertain tax positions. revenues by segment/operating group our five reportable operating segments are our operating groups, which are communications, media & technology; financial services; health & public service; products; and resources. operating groups are managed on the basis of net revenues because our management believes net revenues are a better indicator of operating group performance than revenues. in addition to reporting net revenues by operating group, we also report net revenues by two types of work: consulting and outsourcing, which represent the services sold by our operating groups. consulting net revenues, which include management and technology consulting and systems integration, reflect a finite, distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables. outsourcing net revenues typically reflect ongoing, repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition, run and/or manage operations of client systems or business functions. from time to time, our operating groups work together to sell and implement certain contracts. the resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating operating groups. generally, operating expenses for each operating group have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. however, the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our operating groups affect revenues and operating expenses within our operating groups to differing degrees. the mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our operating groups. local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our operating groups differently, depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses. while we provide discussion about our results of operations below, we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume. management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume. instead, our measures of volume and price are extremely complex, as each of our services contracts is unique, reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements. revenue for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided, the skills required and the outcome sought, as well as estimated cost, risk, contract terms and other factors. 33 results of operations for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 net revenues (by operating group, geographic region and type of work) and reimbursements were as follows: fiscal percent

technology net revenues increased 5% in local currency. outsourcing revenue growth was driven by all industry groups in americas and electronics &amp; high tech in asia pacific. this growth was partially offset by a decline in electronics &amp; high tech in emea. consulting revenues reflected modest growth, led by electronics &amp; high tech in americas and emea, partially offset by declines in communications across all geographic regions. • financial services net revenues increased 5% in local currency. outsourcing revenues reflected very strong growth, driven by all industry groups in emea and asia pacific and capital markets in americas. these increases were partially offset by a decline in insurance in americas. consulting revenues reflected a slight decline, due to declines in insurance in emea and americas, partially offset by growth in banking in emea and asia pacific. while fiscal 2014 consulting net revenues reflected a slight decline, year-over-year growth in the second half of fiscal 2014 partially offset revenue declines in the first half of fiscal 2014. 34 • health &amp; public service net revenues increased 7% in local currency. outsourcing revenues reflected very strong growth, led by health and public service in americas, partially offset by a decline in health in emea. consulting revenues reflected modest growth, driven by public service and health in americas and public service in asia pacific, partially offset by a decline in public service in emea. • products net revenues increased 8% in local currency. outsourcing revenues reflected strong growth, driven by growth across all geographic regions in most industry groups, led by air, freight &amp; travel services and life sciences in americas and retail in emea. these increases were partially offset by declines in retail in americas, and consumer goods &amp; services and air, freight &amp; travel services in emea. consulting revenues reflected strong growth, driven by most industry groups in emea, led by retail, consumer goods &amp; services and auto, and in americas, led by consumer goods &amp; services and air, freight &amp; travel services. this growth was partially offset by declines in retail in asia pacific and americas. • resources net revenues increased 1% in local currency. outsourcing revenues reflected modest growth, driven by energy in americas and utilities in emea, partially offset by a decline in utilities in americas. consulting revenues reflected a slight decline, due to declines in natural resources across all geographic regions and energy in americas, partially offset by growth in energy in asia pacific and emea, utilities in emea and chemicals in americas. some of our clients, primarily in natural resources, continued to reduce their level of consulting investments. in addition, several large systems integration projects have ended or have transitioned to smaller phases and demand for our services has moderated. we expect these trends will continue to impact resources year-over-year net revenue growth in the near term. geographic regions • americas net revenues increased 6% in local currency, driven by the united states, partially offset by a decline in canada. • emea net revenues increased 4% in local currency, driven by france, italy, the united kingdom, switzerland, germany and norway. these increases were partially offset by declines in spain, south africa and finland. • asia pacific net revenues increased 4% in local currency, driven by japan and to a lesser extent india, partially offset by declines in singapore and south korea. in fiscal 2015, we will begin reporting our geographic regions as follows: north america (the united states and canada); europe; and growth markets (asia pacific, latin america, africa, the middle east, russia and turkey). see item 9b, \"other information\" for fiscal 2014 and 2013 net revenues aligned with these revised geographic regions. operating expenses operating expenses for fiscal 2014 were $27,574 million, an increase of $1,519 million, or 6%, over fiscal 2013, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 86.5% from 85.7% during this period. operating expenses before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2014 were $25,702 million, an increase of $1,478 million, or 6%, over fiscal 2013, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 85.7% from 84.8% during this period. operating expenses for fiscal 2013 included reorganization benefits of $274 million as a result of final determinations of certain reorganization liabilities established in connection with our transition to a corporate structure in 2001. cost of services cost of services for fiscal 2014 was $22,190 million, an increase of $1,180 million, or 6%, over fiscal 2013, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 69.6% from 69.1% during this period. cost of services before reimbursable expenses for fiscal 2014 was $20,318 million, an increase of $1,139 million, or 6%, over fiscal 2013, and increased as a percentage of net revenues to 67.7% from 67.1% during this period. gross margin for fiscal 2014 decreased to 32.3% from 32.9% during this period. there were several factors affecting cost of services and gross margin during fiscal 2014. we experienced lower consulting and outsourcing contract profitability compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to pricing pressures in the first half of fiscal 2014 and higher payroll costs as we did not fully absorb the impact of compensation increases and/or rebalance the mix of resources. in addition, we experienced lower margins in the early stages of a few large contracts. while we accrued significant variable compensation during fiscal 2014, the amounts accrued are lower than fiscal 2013 and partially offset the impacts noted above. sales and marketing sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2014 was $3,583 million, an increase of $101 million, or 3%, over fiscal 2013, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 11.9% from 12.2% during this period. general and administrative costs general and administrative costs for fiscal 2014 were $1,819 million, a decrease of $17 million, or 1%, from fiscal 2013, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 6.1% from 6.4% during this period. 35 reorganization (benefits) costs, net we recorded net reorganization benefits of $272 million ($274 million in reorganization benefits less $1.9 million in interest expense accrued) during fiscal 2013 as a result of final determinations of certain reorganization liabilities established in connection with our transition to a corporate structure in 2001. for additional information, refer to note 3 (reorganization (benefits) costs, net) to our consolidated financial statements under item 8, \"financial statements and supplementary data.\" operating income and operating margin operating income for fiscal 2014 was $4,301 million, a decrease of $38 million, or 1%, from fiscal 2013, and decreased as a percentage of net revenues to 14.3% from 15.2% during this period. during fiscal 2013, we recorded reorganization benefits of $274 million, which increased operating margin by 100 basis points. excluding the effects of the fiscal 2013 reorganization benefits, operating margin for fiscal 2014 increased 10 basis points compared to fiscal 2013. operating income and operating margin for each of the operating groups were as follows: fiscal 2014 2013 operatingincome operatingmargin operatingincome operatingmargin (in millions of u.s. dollars) communications, media &amp;

(1) represents reorganization benefits related to final determinations of certain reorganization liabilities established in connection with our transition to a corporate structure during 2001. (2) we have presented operating income and operating margin excluding reorganization benefits, as we believe the effect of the reorganization benefits on operating income and operating margin facilitates understanding as to both the impact of these benefits and our operating performance. 36 during fiscal 2014, the financial results of each operating group benefited from a reduction in variable compensation compared to fiscal 2013. the commentary below provides additional insight into other factors affecting operating group performance and operating margin for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013, exclusive of the reorganization benefit recorded in fiscal 2013: • communications, media &amp;

public service operating income increased due to revenue growth. • products operating income was impacted by lower consulting contract profitability, including delivery inefficiencies on a few contracts. operating income was favorably impacted by revenue growth. • resources operating income was impacted by lower consulting contract profitability and higher sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues. operating income was favorably impacted by higher outsourcing contract profitability. provision for income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was 26.1%, compared with 18.1% for fiscal 2013. during fiscal 2013, we recorded reorganization benefits of $274 million, which increased income before income taxes without any increase in income tax expense. in addition, during fiscal 2013, we recorded a benefit of $243 million related to settlements of u.s. federal tax audits for fiscal years 2006 through 2009. absent these items, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 would have been 25.3%. the higher effective tax rate during fiscal 2014 is primarily due to lower benefits related to final determinations of prior year tax liabilities. net income attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests eliminates the income earned or expense incurred attributable to the equity interest that some of our current and former members of accenture leadership and their permitted transferees have in our accenture sca and accenture canada holdings inc. subsidiaries. see \"business-organizational structure.\" the resulting net income attributable to accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders of accenture plc. since january 2002, noncontrolling interests has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to noncontrolling shareholders in our avanade inc. subsidiary. net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2014 was $234 million, a decrease of $38 million, or 14%, from fiscal 2013. the decrease was due to lower net income of $379 million and a reduction in the accenture sca class i common shares and accenture canada holdings inc. exchangeable shares average noncontrolling ownership interest to 6% for fiscal 2014 from 7% for fiscal 2013. earnings per share diluted earnings per share were $4.52 for fiscal 2014, compared with $4.93 for fiscal 2013. the $0.41 decrease in our earnings per share included the impact of the reorganization benefits of $274 million, which increased earnings per share for fiscal 2013 by $0.38, and the $243 million tax benefit related to settlements of u.s. federal tax audits, which increased earnings per share for fiscal 2013 by $0.34. excluding the impact of these benefits, earnings per share for fiscal 2014 increased $0.31 compared with earnings per share for fiscal 2013, due to increases of $0.25 from higher revenues and operating results and $0.12 from lower weighted average shares outstanding. these increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.06 from a higher effective tax rate, excluding the impact of the tax benefit related to settlements of u.s. federal tax audits and reorganization benefits. for information regarding our earnings per share calculations, see note 2 (earnings per share) to our consolidated financial statements under item 8, \"financial statements and supplementary data.\" 37 results of operations for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 net revenues (by operating group, geographic region and type of work) and reimbursements were as follows: fiscal percent percent percent of total increase increase net revenues (decrease) (decrease) for fiscal u.s. local dollars currency 2013 2012 2013 2012 (in millions of u.s. dollars) operating groups communications, media &amp;

IT capability is a firm's ability to acquire, deploy, combine, and reconfigure IT resources in support and enhancement of business strategies and work processes. we focus on information management capability—that is, the ability to provide data and information to users with the appropriate levels of accuracy, timeliness, reliability, security, confidentiality, connectivity, and access and the ability to tailor these in response to changing business needs and directions. at its core, the notion of it capability underscores the importance of mobilizing and deploying it-based resources in combination with, and leveraging the value of, other resources and capabilities. it capability, broadly defined as the it function’s competence to effectively support business needs, has become a key in transforming a firm into a competitive force. a firm’s it capabilities represent the application of physical or intangible it resources such as technology, knowledge, practices, relationships, management skills, business process understanding and human resources to further organizational goals.\"\"\"\n\nText:\n\"\"\"item 1a. risk factors factors that could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition are outlined below. additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem insignificant may also impair our business or results of operations as they become known facts or as facts and circumstances change. any of the risks described below could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. insurance our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected by the occurrence of natural and man-made disasters. we have substantial exposure to losses resulting from natural disasters, man-made catastrophes such as terrorism or cyber-attack, and other catastrophic events, including pandemics. this could impact a variety of our businesses, including our commercial and personal lines, and life and a&h products. catastrophes can be caused by various events, including hurricanes, typhoons, earthquakes, hailstorms, drought, explosions, severe winter weather, fires, war, acts of terrorism, nuclear accidents, political instability, and other natural or man-made disasters, including a global or other wide-impact pandemic or a significant cyber-attack. the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable and our losses from catastrophes could be substantial. in addition, climate conditions may be changing, primarily through changes in global temperatures, which may increase the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes and the resulting losses in the future. we cannot predict the impact that changing climate conditions, if any, may have on our results of operations or our financial condition. additionally, we cannot predict how legal, regulatory and/or social responses to concerns around global climate change may impact our business. the occurrence of claims from catastrophic events could result in substantial volatility in our results of operations or financial condition for any fiscal quarter or year. the historical incidence for events such as earthquakes, pandemics and cyber-attacks is infrequent and may not be representative of contemporary exposures and risks. as an example, increases in the values and concentrations of insured property may increase the severity of these occurrences in the future. although we attempt to manage our exposure to such events through the use of underwriting controls, risk models, and the purchase of third-party reinsurance, catastrophic events are inherently unpredictable and the actual nature of such events when they occur could be more frequent or severe than contemplated in our pricing and risk management expectations. as a result, the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. if actual claims exceed our loss reserves, our financial results could be adversely affected. our results of operations and financial condition depend upon our ability to accurately assess the potential losses associated with the risks that we insure and reinsure. we establish reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses, which are estimates of future payments of reported and unreported claims for losses and related expenses, with respect to insured events that have occurred at or prior to the balance sheet date. the process of establishing reserves can be highly complex and is subject to considerable variability as it requires the use of informed estimates and judgments. actuarial staff in each of our segments analyze insurance reserves and regularly evaluate the levels of loss reserves. any such evaluations could result in future changes in estimates of losses or reinsurance recoverables and would be reflected in our results of operations in the period in which the estimates are changed. losses and loss expenses are charged to income as incurred. during the loss settlement period, which can be many years in duration for some of our lines of business, additional facts regarding individual claims and trends often will become known which may result in a change in overall reserves. in addition, application of statistical and actuarial methods may require the adjustment of overall reserves upward or downward from time to time. included in our loss reserves are liabilities for latent claims such as a&e, which are principally related to claims arising from remediation costs associated with hazardous waste sites and bodily-injury claims related to exposure to asbestos products and environmental hazards. at december 31, 2014, gross a&e liabilities represented approximately 4.4 percent of our loss reserves. the estimation of these liabilities is subject to many complex variables including: the current legal environment; specific settlements that may be used as precedents to settle future claims; assumptions regarding trends with respect to claim severity and the frequency of higher severity claims; assumptions regarding the ability to allocate liability among defendants (including bankruptcy trusts) and other insurers; the ability of a claimant to bring a claim in a state in which they have no residency or exposure; the ability of a policyholder to claim the right to non-products coverage; whether high-level excess policies have the potential to be accessed given the policyholder's claim trends and liability situation; payments to unimpaired claimants; and, the potential liability of peripheral defendants. accordingly, the ultimate settlement of losses, arising from either latent or non-latent causes may be significantly greater or less than the loss and loss expense reserves held at the balance sheet date. in particular the amount and timing of the settlement of our p&c liabilities are not determinate and our actual payments 19 could be higher than contemplated in our loss reserves owing to the impact of insurance, judicial and/or social inflation. if our loss reserves are inadequate, we may be required to increase loss reserves at the time of the determination and our net income and capital may be reduced. the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain. as industry practices and legislative, regulatory, judicial, social, financial, technology and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. these issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the frequency and severity of claims. in some instances, these changes may not become apparent until after we have issued insurance or reinsurance contracts that are affected by the changes. as a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance or reinsurance contracts may not be known for many years after issuance. the failure of any of the loss limitation methods we use could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. we seek to manage our loss exposure by maintaining a disciplined underwriting process throughout our insurance operations. we also look to limit our loss exposure by writing a number of our insurance and reinsurance contracts on an excess of loss basis. excess of loss insurance and reinsurance indemnifies the insured against losses in excess of a specified amount. in addition, we limit program size for each client and purchase third-party reinsurance for our own account. in the case of our assumed proportional reinsurance treaties, we seek per occurrence limitations or loss and loss expense ratio caps to limit the impact of losses ceded by the client. in proportional reinsurance, the reinsurer shares a proportional part of the premiums and losses of the reinsured. we also seek to limit our loss exposure by geographic diversification. geographic zone limitations involve significant underwriting judgments, including the determination of the area of the zones and the inclusion of a particular policy within a particular zone's limits. various provisions of our policies, such as limitations or exclusions from coverage or choice of forum negotiated to limit our risks, may not be enforceable in the manner we intend. as a result, one or more catastrophic or other events could result in claims that substantially exceed our expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. we may be unable to purchase reinsurance, and if we successfully purchase reinsurance, we are subject to the possibility of non-payment. we purchase protection from third parties including, but not limited to, reinsurance to protect against catastrophes and other sources of volatility, to increase the amount of protection we can provide our clients, and as part of our overall risk management strategy. our reinsurance business also purchases retrocessional protection which allows a reinsurer to cede to another company all or part of the reinsurance originally assumed by the reinsurer. a reinsurer's or retrocessionaire's insolvency or inability or unwillingness to make timely payments under the terms of its reinsurance agreement with us could have an adverse effect on us because we remain liable to the insured. from time to time, market conditions have limited, and in some cases have prevented, insurers and reinsurers from obtaining the types and amounts of reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance that they consider adequate for their business needs. there is no guarantee our desired amounts of reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance will be available in the marketplace in the future. in addition to capacity risk, the remaining capacity may not be on terms we deem appropriate or acceptable or with companies with whom we want to do business. finally, we face some degree of counterparty risk whenever we purchase reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance. consequently, the insolvency, inability, or unwillingness of any of our present or future reinsurers to make timely payments to us under the terms of our reinsurance or retrocessional agreements could have an adverse effect on us. at december 31, 2014, we had $12.0 billion of reinsurance recoverables, net of reserves for uncollectible recoverables. certain active ace companies are primarily liable for a&e and other exposures they have reinsured to our inactive run-off company century indemnity company (century). at december 31, 2014, the aggregate reinsurance balances ceded by our active subsidiaries to century were approximately $1.1 billion. should century's loss reserves experience adverse development in the future and should century be placed into rehabilitation or liquidation, the reinsurance recoverables due from century to its affiliates would be payable only after the payment in full of certain expenses and liabilities, including administrative expenses and direct policy liabilities. thus, the intercompany reinsurance recoverables would be at risk to the extent of the shortage of assets remaining to pay these recoverables. while we believe the intercompany reinsurance recoverables from century are not impaired at this time, we cannot assure that adverse development with respect to century's loss reserves, if manifested, will not result in century's insolvency, which could result in our recognizing a loss to the extent of any uncollectible reinsurance from century. this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 20 our net income may be volatile because certain products sold by our life business expose us to reserve and fair value liability changes that are directly affected by market and other factors and assumptions. our pricing, establishment of reserves for future policy benefits and valuation of life insurance and annuity products, including reinsurance programs, are based upon various assumptions, including but not limited to market changes, interest rates, mortality rates, morbidity rates, and policyholder behavior. the process of establishing reserves for future policy benefits relies on our ability to accurately estimate insured events that have not yet occurred but that are expected to occur in future periods. significant deviations in actual experience from assumptions used for pricing and for reserves for future policy benefits could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our products and our business. under reinsurance programs covering variable annuity guarantees, we assumed the risk of guaranteed minimum death benefits (gmdb) and guaranteed living benefits (glb) associated with variable annuity contracts. we ceased writing this business in 2007. our net income is directly impacted by changes in the reserves calculated in connection with the reinsurance of gmdb and glb liabilities. in addition, our net income is directly impacted by the change in the fair value of the glb liability. reported liabilities for both gmdb and glb reinsurance are determined using internal valuation models which require considerable judgment and are subject to significant uncertainty. refer to the \"critical accounting estimates - guaranteed living benefits (glb) derivatives\", under item 7 and \"quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk - reinsurance of gmdb and glb guarantees\", under item 7a for additional information on the assumptions used in this program. we view our variable annuity reinsurance business as having a similar risk profile to that of catastrophe reinsurance, with the probability of long-term economic loss relatively small at the time of pricing. adverse changes in market factors and policyholder behavior will have an impact on both life underwriting income and net income. our exposure to counterparties in various industries, our reliance on brokers, and certain of our policies may subject us to credit risk. we have exposure to counterparties through reinsurance and in various industries, including banks, hedge funds and other investment vehicles, and derivative transactions that expose us to credit risk in the event our counterparty fails to perform its obligations. we also have exposure to financial institutions in the form of secured and unsecured debt instruments and equity securities. in accordance with industry practice, we generally pay amounts owed on claims to brokers who, in turn, remit these amounts to the insured or ceding insurer. although the law is unsettled and depends upon the facts and circumstances of the particular case, in some jurisdictions, if a broker fails to make such a payment, we might remain liable to the insured or ceding insurer for the deficiency. conversely, in certain jurisdictions, if the brokers do not remit premiums paid for these policies over to us, these premiums might be considered to have been paid and the insured or ceding insurer will no longer be liable to us for those amounts, whether or not we have actually received the premiums from the broker. consequently, we assume a degree of credit risk associated with brokers with whom we transact business. however, due to the unsettled and fact-specific nature of the law, we are unable to quantify our exposure to this risk. to date, we have not experienced any material losses related to these credit risks. under the terms of certain high-deductible policies which we offer, such as workers' compensation and general liability, our customers are responsible to reimburse us for an agreed-upon dollar amount per claim. in nearly all cases we are required under such policies to pay covered claims first, and then seek reimbursement for amounts within the applicable deductible from our customers. this obligation subjects us to credit risk from these customers. while we generally seek to mitigate this risk through collateral agreements and maintain a provision for uncollectible accounts associated with this credit exposure, an increased inability of customers to reimburse us in this context could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. in addition, a lack of credit available to our customers could impact our ability to collateralize this risk to our satisfaction, which in turn, could reduce the amount of high-deductible policies we could offer. since we depend on a few brokers for a large portion of our revenues, loss of business provided by any one of them could adversely affect us. we market our insurance and reinsurance worldwide primarily through insurance and reinsurance brokers. marsh, inc. and its affiliates provided approximately 10 percent of our gross premiums written in 2014. loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided by one or more of these brokers could have an adverse effect on our business. financial our investment performance may affect our financial results and ability to conduct business. our investment assets are invested by professional investment management firms under the direction of our management team in accordance with investment guidelines approved by the risk & finance committee of the board of directors. although our 21 investment guidelines stress diversification of risks and conservation of principal and liquidity, our investments are subject to market risks and risks inherent in individual securities. interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including inflation, monetary and fiscal policies, and domestic and international political conditions. the volatility of our losses may force us to liquidate securities, which may cause us to incur capital losses. realized and unrealized losses in our investment portfolio would generally reduce our book value, and if significant, can affect our ability to conduct business. volatility in interest rates could impact the performance of our investment portfolio which could have an adverse effect on our investment income and operating results. although we take measures to manage the risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment, we may not be able to effectively mitigate interest rate sensitivity. our mitigation efforts include maintaining a high quality portfolio of primarily fixed income investments with a relatively short duration to reduce the effect of interest rate changes on book value. a significant increase in interest rates would generally have an adverse effect on our book value. our life insurance investments typically focus on longer duration bonds to better match the obligations of this business. for the life business, policyholder behavior may be influenced by changing interest rate conditions and require a rebalancing of duration to effectively manage our asset/liability position. our fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in high quality, investment-grade securities. a smaller portion of the portfolio, approximately 14 percent at december 31, 2014, is invested in below investment-grade securities. these securities, which pay a higher rate of interest, also have a higher degree of credit or default risk and may also be less liquid in times of economic weakness or market disruptions. while we have put in place procedures to monitor the credit risk and liquidity of our invested assets, it is possible that, in periods of economic weakness (such as recession), we may experience credit or default losses in our portfolio, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. as a part of our ongoing analysis of our investment portfolio, we are required to assess whether the debt and equity securities we hold for which we have recorded an unrealized loss have been \"other-than-temporarily impaired\" under gaap, which implies an inability to recover the full economic benefits of these securities. refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. this analysis requires a high degree of judgment and requires us to make certain assessments about the potential for recovery of the assets we hold. declines in relevant stock and other financial markets, and other factors impacting the value of our investments, could result in impairments and could adversely affect our net income and other financial results. we may require additional capital or financing sources in the future, which may not be available or may be available only on unfavorable terms. our future capital and financing requirements depend on many factors, including our ability to write new business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses, as well as our investment performance. we may need to raise additional funds through financings or access funds through existing or new credit facilities or through short-term repurchase agreements. we also from time to time seek to refinance debt or credit as amounts become due or commitments expire. any equity or debt financing or refinancing, if available at all, may be on terms that are not favorable to us. in the case of equity financings, dilution to our shareholders could result, and in any case, such securities may have rights, preferences, and privileges that are senior to those of our common shares. our access to funds under existing credit facilities is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facilities to meet their funding commitments. if we cannot obtain adequate capital or sources of credit on favorable terms, or at all, we could be forced to use assets otherwise available for our business operations, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected. we may be required to post additional collateral because of changes in our reinsurance liabilities to regulated insurance companies, or because of regulatory changes that affect our companies. if our reinsurance liabilities increase, we may be required to post additional collateral for insurance company clients. in addition, regulatory changes sometimes affect our obligations to post collateral. the need to post this additional collateral, if significant enough, may require us to sell investments at a loss in order to provide securities of suitable credit quality or otherwise secure adequate capital at an unattractive cost. this could adversely impact our net income and liquidity and capital resources. u.s. and global economic and financial industry events and their consequences could harm our business, our liquidity and financial condition, and our stock price. the consequences of adverse global or regional market and economic conditions may affect (among other aspects of our business) the demand for and claims made under our products, the ability of customers, counterparties, and others to establish or maintain their relationships with us, our ability to access and efficiently use internal and external capital resources, the 22 availability of reinsurance protection, the risks we assume under reinsurance programs covering variable annuity guarantees, and our investment performance. volatility in the u.s. and other securities markets may adversely affect our stock price. a decline in our financial strength ratings could affect our standing among brokers and customers and cause our premiums and earnings to decrease. a decline in our debt ratings could increase our borrowing costs and impact our ability to access capital markets. ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance and reinsurance companies. the objective of these rating systems is to provide an opinion of an insurer's financial strength and ability to meet ongoing obligations to its policyholders. a ratings downgrade could result in a substantial loss of business as insureds, ceding companies, and brokers move to other insurers and reinsurers with higher ratings. if one or more of our debt ratings were downgraded, we could also incur higher borrowing costs, and our ability to access the capital markets could be impacted. additionally, we could be required to post collateral or be faced with the cancellation of policies and resulting premium in certain circumstances. we cannot give any assurance regarding whether or to what extent any of the rating agencies may downgrade our ratings in the future. our ability to pay dividends and to make payments on indebtedness may be constrained by our holding company structure. ace limited is a holding company and does not have any significant operations or assets other than its ownership of the shares of its operating insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries. dividends and other permitted distributions from our insurance subsidiaries are our primary source of funds to meet ongoing cash requirements, including any future debt service payments and other expenses, and to pay dividends to our shareholders. some of our insurance subsidiaries are subject to significant regulatory restrictions limiting their ability to declare and pay dividends. the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our cash requirements at the holding company level could have an adverse effect on our operations and our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders and/or meet our debt service obligations. our operating results and shareholders' equity may be adversely affected by currency fluctuations. our reporting currency is the u.s. dollar. in general, we match assets and liabilities in local currencies. where possible, capital levels in local currencies are limited to satisfy minimum regulatory requirements and to support local insurance operations. the principal currencies creating foreign exchange risk are the british pound sterling, the brazilian real, the mexican peso, the euro, the canadian dollar, the korean won, the australian dollar, and the yen. at december 31, 2014, approximately 25.3 percent of our net assets were denominated in foreign currencies. we may experience losses resulting from fluctuations in the values of non-u.s. currencies, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. operational the regulatory and political regimes under which we operate, and their volatility, could have an adverse effect on our business. our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries conduct business globally. our businesses in each jurisdiction are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision. the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are domiciled require, among other things, maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital, surplus, and liquidity; various solvency standards; and periodic examinations of subsidiaries' financial condition. in some jurisdictions, laws and regulations also restrict payments of dividends and reductions of capital. applicable statutes, regulations, and policies may also restrict the ability of these subsidiaries to write insurance and reinsurance policies, to make certain investments, and to distribute funds. the purpose of insurance laws and regulations generally is to protect policyholders and ceding insurance companies, not our shareholders. for example, some jurisdictions have enacted various consumer protection laws that make it more burdensome for insurance companies to sell policies and interact with customers in personal lines businesses. failure to comply with such regulations can lead to significant penalties and reputational injury. fines and penalties in the u.s. in particular have been trending upwards. the foreign and u.s. federal and state laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations are complex and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance or subject our business to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings. laws and regulations not specifically related to the insurance industry include trade sanctions that relate to certain countries, anti-money laundering laws, and anti-corruption laws such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act 2010, the anti-bribery provisions of the swiss penal code and similar local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials. the insurance industry is also affected by political, judicial, and legal developments that may create new and expanded regulations and theories of liability. the current economic climate and the recent financial crisis present additional uncertainties and risks relating to increased regulation and the potential for increased involvement of the u.s. and other governments in the financial services industry. 23 in addition, various legislative initiatives may impact the conduct of our business. for example, in the u.s., congress may make changes to the terrorism risk insurance program, which could have adverse effects on our business. regulators in countries where we have operations are working with the international association of insurance supervisors (iais) to consider changes to insurance company supervision, including with respect to group supervision and solvency requirements. the iais is developing a common framework to supervise internationally active insurance groups, such as ace, known as com frame. as part of com frame, the iais has announced plans to develop an international capital standard for insurance groups. the details of com frame including this global capital standard and its applicability to ace are uncertain at this time. in addition, the european union (eu) is implementing a new capital and risk management regime known as solvency ii that would apply to our businesses across the eu, effective january 1, 2016. ace businesses are also subject to the requirements of the swiss financial market supervisory authority (finma) whose regulations include swiss solvency tests. there are also risk based capital requirements in the u.s. which are also subject to revision in response to global developments. while it is not certain how or if these actions will impact ace, we do not currently expect that our capital management strategies, results of operations and financial condition will be materially affected by these regulatory changes. in the event or absence of changes in applicable laws and regulations in particular jurisdictions, we may from time to time face challenges, or changes in approach to oversight of our business from insurance or other regulators, including challenges resulting from requiring the use of information technology that cannot be quickly adjusted to address new regulatory requirements. we may not be able to comply fully with, or obtain appropriate exemptions from, applicable statutes and regulations and any changes thereto, which could have an adverse effect on our business. failure to comply with or to obtain appropriate authorizations and/or exemptions under any applicable laws and regulations could result in restrictions on our ability to do business or undertake activities that are regulated in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business and could subject us to fines and other sanctions. our worldwide operations, particularly in developing nations expose us to global geopolitical developments that could have an adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition. with operations in 54 countries, we provide insurance and reinsurance products and services to a diverse group of clients worldwide, including operations in various developing nations. both current and future foreign operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable geopolitical developments including law changes, tax changes, regulatory restrictions, government leadership changes, political events and upheaval, sociopolitical instability, and nationalization of our operations without compensation. adverse activity in any one country could negatively impact operations, increase our loss exposure under certain of our insurance products, and could, otherwise, have an adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition depending on the magnitude of the events and our net financial exposure at that time in that country. a failure in our operational systems or infrastructure or those of third parties, including due to security breaches or cyber-attacks, could disrupt business, damage our reputation, and cause losses. our operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information and assets, including in our computer systems and networks. our business depends on effective information security and systems and the integrity and timeliness of the data our information systems use to run our business. our ability to adequately price products and services, to establish reserves, to provide effective, efficient and secure service to our customers, to value our investments and to timely and accurately report our financial results also depends significantly on the integrity and availability of the data we maintain, including that within our information systems, as well as data in and assets held through third-party service providers and systems. in an effort to ensure the integrity of such data, we implement new security measures and systems and improve or upgrade our existing security measures and systems on a continuing basis. although we have implemented administrative and technical controls and take protective actions to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and to protect our information technology and assets, and we endeavor to modify such procedures as circumstances warrant and negotiate agreements with third-party providers to protect our assets, such measures may be insufficient to prevent unauthorized access, computer viruses, malware or other malicious code or cyber-attack, catastrophic events, system failures and disruptions (including in relation to new security measures and systems), employee errors or malfeasance, third party (including outsourced service providers) errors or malfeasance, loss of assets and other events that could have security consequences (each, a security event). as the breadth and complexity of our security infrastructure continues to grow, the potential risk of a security event increases. like other global companies, we have from time to time experienced security events, none of which had a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. if additional security events occur, these events may jeopardize ace's or its clients' or counterparties' confidential and other information processed and stored within ace, and transmitted through its computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions, delays, or malfunctions in ace's, its clients', its counterparties', or third parties' operations, or result in data loss or loss of assets which could result in significant losses, 24 reputational damage or a material adverse effect on our operations and critical business functions. ace may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures and to pursue recovery of lost data or assets and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered by insurance maintained. the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. we are subject to numerous u.s. federal and state laws and foreign regulations governing the protection of personal and confidential information of our clients or employees, including in relation to medical records, credit card data and financial information. these laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently and sometimes conflict. if any person, including any of our employees or those with whom we share such information, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to our client data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions. despite the contingency plans and facilities we have in place and our efforts to observe the regulatory requirements surrounding information security, our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by a disruption of the infrastructure that supports our business in the communities in which we are located, or of outsourced services or functions. this may include a disruption involving electrical, communications, transportation, or other services used by ace. if a disruption occurs in one location and ace employees in that location are unable to occupy our offices and conduct business or communicate with or travel to other locations, our ability to service and interact with clients may suffer and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communication or travel. we use analytical models to assist our decision making in key areas such as underwriting, claims, reserving, and catastrophe risks but actual results could differ materially from the model outputs and related analyses. we use various modeling techniques (e.g., scenarios, predictive, stochastic and/or forecasting) and data analytics to analyze and estimate exposures, loss trends and other risks associated with our assets and liabilities. we use the modeled outputs and related analyses to assist us in decision-making (e.g., underwriting, pricing, claims, reserving, reinsurance, and catastrophe risk) and to maintain competitive advantage. the modeled outputs and related analyses are subject to various assumptions, uncertainties, model errors and the inherent limitations of any statistical analysis, including the use of historical internal and industry data. in addition, the modeled outputs and related analyses may from time to time contain inaccuracies, perhaps in material respects, including as a result of inaccurate inputs or applications thereof. consequently, actual results may differ materially from our modeled results. if, based upon these models or other factors, we misprice our products or underestimate the frequency and/or severity of loss events, or overestimate the risks we are exposed to, new business growth and retention of our existing business may be adversely affected which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. we could be adversely affected by the loss of one or more key executives or by an inability to attract and retain qualified personnel. our success depends on our ability to retain the services of our existing key executives and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel in the future. the loss of the services of any of our key executives or the inability to hire and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could adversely affect our ability to conduct or grow our business. this risk may be particularly acute for us relative to some of our competitors because some of our senior executives work in countries where they are not citizens and work permit and immigration issues could adversely affect the ability to retain or hire key persons. we do not maintain key person life insurance policies with respect to our employees. employee error and misconduct may be difficult to detect and prevent and could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. losses may result from, among other things, fraud, errors, failure to document transactions properly, failure to obtain proper internal authorization, failure to comply with underwriting or other internal guidelines, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements. it is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct and the precautions that we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. resultant losses could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. strategic competition in the insurance and reinsurance markets could reduce our margins. insurance and reinsurance markets are highly competitive. we compete on an international and regional basis with major u.s., bermuda, european, and other international insurers and reinsurers and with underwriting syndicates, some of which have greater financial, marketing, and management resources than we do. we also compete with new companies that continue to be 25 formed to enter the insurance and reinsurance markets. in addition, capital market participants have created alternative products that are intended to compete with reinsurance products. increased competition could result in fewer submissions, lower premium rates, and less favorable policy terms and conditions, which could reduce our profit margins and adversely impact our net income and book value. insurance and reinsurance markets are historically cyclical, and we expect to experience periods with excess underwriting capacity and unfavorable premium rates. the insurance and reinsurance markets have historically been cyclical, characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity as well as periods when shortages of capacity permitted favorable premium levels. an increase in premium levels is often offset by an increasing supply of insurance and reinsurance capacity, either by capital provided by new entrants or by the commitment of additional capital by existing insurers or reinsurers, which may cause prices to decrease. any of these factors could lead to a significant reduction in premium rates, less favorable policy terms, and fewer submissions for our underwriting services. in addition to these considerations, changes in the frequency and severity of losses suffered by insureds and insurers may affect the cycles of the insurance and reinsurance markets significantly, as could periods of economic weakness (such as recession). the integration of acquired companies may not be as successful as we anticipate. acquisitions involve numerous operational, strategic, financial, accounting, legal, tax and other risks; potential liabilities associated with the acquired businesses; and uncertainties related to design, operation and integration of acquired businesses' internal controls over financial reporting. difficulties in integrating an acquired company may result in the acquired company performing differently than we expected, in operational challenges or in our failure to realize anticipated expense-related efficiencies. our existing businesses could also be negatively impacted by acquisitions. in addition, goodwill and intangible assets recorded in connection with insurance company acquisitions may be impaired if premium growth, underwriting profitability, agency retention and policy persistency, among other factors, differ from expectations. there is also the potential that proposed acquisitions that have been publicly announced will not be consummated, even if a definitive agreement has been signed by the parties. if an agreement is terminated before closing, the result would be that our proposed acquisition would not occur, which could, among other things, expose us to damages or liability and adversely impact our stock price and future operations. we may be subject to u.s. tax and bermuda tax which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and shareholder investment. ace limited and our non-u.s. subsidiaries operate in a manner so that none of these companies should be subject to u.s. tax (other than u.s. excise tax on insurance and reinsurance premium income attributable to insuring or reinsuring u.s. risks and u.s. withholding tax on some types of u.s. source investment income), because none of these companies should be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the u.s. however, because there is considerable uncertainty as to the activities that constitute being engaged in a trade or business within the u.s., we cannot be certain that the internal revenue service (irs) will not contend successfully that ace limited or its non-u.s. subsidiaries are engaged in a trade or business in the u.s. if ace limited or any of its non-u.s. subsidiaries were considered to be engaged in a trade or business in the u.s., such entity could be subject to u.s. corporate income and branch profits taxes on the portion of its earnings effectively connected to such u.s. business, in which case our results of operations and our shareholders' investments could be adversely affected. the bermuda minister of finance, under the exempted undertakings tax protection act 1966 of bermuda, as amended, has given ace limited and its bermuda insurance subsidiaries a written assurance that if any legislation is enacted in bermuda that would impose tax computed on profits or income, or computed on any capital asset, gain, or appreciation, or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax, then the imposition of any such tax would not be applicable to those companies or any of their respective operations, shares, debentures, or other obligations until march 31, 2035, except insofar as such tax would apply to persons ordinarily resident in bermuda or is payable by us in respect of real property owned or leased by us in bermuda. we cannot be certain that we will not be subject to any bermuda tax after march 31, 2035. the organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd) and the european union (eu) are considering measures that might encourage countries to increase our taxes. the oecd has published an action plan to address base erosion and profit shifting (beps) impacting its member countries and other jurisdictions. it is possible that jurisdictions in which we do business could react to the beps initiative or their own concerns by enacting tax legislation that could adversely affect us or our shareholders. a number of multilateral organizations, including the eu and the oecd have, in recent years, expressed concern about some countries not participating in adequate tax information exchange arrangements and have threatened those that do not agree to 26 cooperate with punitive sanctions by member countries. it is as yet unclear what all of these sanctions might be, which countries might adopt them, and when or if they might be imposed. we cannot assure, however, that the tax information exchange agreements (tieas) that have been or will be entered into by switzerland and bermuda will be sufficient to preclude all of the sanctions described above, which, if ultimately adopted, could adversely affect us or our shareholders. shareholders there are provisions in our charter documents that may reduce the voting rights and diminish the value of our common shares. our articles of association generally provide that shareholders have one vote for each common share held by them and are entitled to vote at all meetings of shareholders. however, the voting rights exercisable by a shareholder may be limited so that certain persons or groups are not deemed to hold 10 percent or more of the voting power conferred by our common shares. moreover, these provisions could have the effect of reducing the voting power of some shareholders who would not otherwise be subject to the limitation by virtue of their direct share ownership. our board of directors may refuse to register holders of shares as shareholders with voting rights based on certain grounds, including if the holder would, directly or indirectly, formally, constructively or beneficially own (as described in articles 8 and 14 of our articles of association) or otherwise control voting rights with respect to 10 percent or more of the registered share capital recorded in the commercial register. in addition, the board of directors shall reject entry of holders of registered shares as shareholders with voting rights in the share register or shall decide on their deregistration when the acquirer or shareholder upon request does not expressly state that she/he has acquired or holds the shares in her/his own name and for her/his account. applicable laws may make it difficult to effect a change of control of our company. before a person can acquire control of a u.s. insurance company, prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance commissioner of the state where the domestic insurer is domiciled. prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurer, the state insurance commissioner will consider such factors as the financial strength of the applicant, the integrity and management of the applicant's board of directors and executive officers, the acquirer's plans for the future operations of the domestic insurer, and any anti-competitive results that may arise from the consummation of the acquisition of control. generally, state statutes provide that control over a domestic insurer is presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing 10 percent or more of the voting securities of the domestic insurer. because a person acquiring 10 percent or more of our common shares would indirectly control the same percentage of the stock of our u.s. insurance subsidiaries, the insurance change of control laws of various u.s. jurisdictions would likely apply to such a transaction. laws of other jurisdictions in which one or more of our existing subsidiaries are, or a future subsidiary may be, organized or domiciled may contain similar restrictions on the acquisition of control of ace. while our articles of association limit the voting power of any shareholder to less than 10 percent, we cannot assure that the applicable regulatory body would agree that a shareholder who owned 10 percent or more of our common shares did not, because of the limitation on the voting power of such shares, control the applicable insurance subsidiary. these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter, or prevent a change of control of ace, including transactions that some or all of our shareholders might consider to be desirable. shareholder voting requirements under swiss law may limit ace's flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management. swiss law allows our shareholders to authorize share capital which can be issued by the board of directors without shareholder approval but this authorization must be renewed by the shareholders every two years. swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of stock as permitted in other jurisdictions. swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders many corporate actions over which the board of directors had authority prior to our redomestication to switzerland. for example, dividends must be approved by shareholders. while we do not believe that swiss law requirements relating to our capital management will have an adverse effect on ace, we cannot assure that situations will not arise where such flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders. ace limited is a swiss company; it may be difficult to enforce judgments against it or its directors and executive officers. ace limited is incorporated pursuant to the laws of switzerland. in addition, certain of our directors and officers reside outside the u.s. and all or a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of such persons are located in jurisdictions outside the u.s. as such, it may be difficult or impossible to effect service of process within the u.s. upon those persons or to recover against us or them on judgments of u.s. courts, including judgments predicated upon civil liability provisions of the u.s. federal securities laws. 27 ace has been advised by its swiss counsel that there is doubt as to whether the courts in switzerland would enforce: • judgments of u.s. courts based upon the civil liability provisions of the u.s. federal securities laws obtained in actions against it or its directors and officers, who reside outside the u.s.; or • original actions brought in switzerland against these persons or ace predicated solely upon u.s. federal securities laws. ace has also been advised by its swiss counsel that there is no treaty in effect between the u.s. and switzerland providing for this enforcement and there are grounds upon which swiss courts may not enforce judgments of u.s. courts. some remedies available under the laws of u.s. jurisdictions, including some remedies available under the u.s. federal securities laws, would not be allowed in swiss courts as contrary to that nation's public policy. as a result of the increase in par value of our shares that occurred in connection with our redomestication from the cayman islands to switzerland in july 2008, we have less flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management than previously. as of december 31, 2014, the par value of our common shares is chf 24.77 per share. under swiss law, we generally may not issue registered shares below their par value. in the event there is a need to raise common equity capital at a time when the trading price of our registered shares is below our par value, we will need to obtain approval of our shareholders to decrease the par value of our registered shares. we cannot assure that we would be able to obtain such shareholder approval. furthermore, obtaining shareholder approval would require filing a preliminary proxy statement with the sec and convening a meeting of shareholders which would delay any capital raising plans. furthermore, any reduction in par value would decrease our ability to pay dividends as a repayment of share capital which is not subject to swiss withholding tax. see \"shareholders may be subject to swiss withholding taxes on the payment of dividends\" for additional information. shareholders may be subject to swiss withholding taxes on the payment of dividends. our dividends are generally subject to a swiss withholding tax at a rate of 35 percent; however, payment of a dividend in the form of a par value reduction or qualifying capital contribution reserves reduction is not subject to swiss withholding tax. we have previously obtained shareholder approval for dividends to be paid in such form. we currently intend to recommend to shareholders that they annually approve the payment of dividends in such form but we cannot assure that our shareholders will continue to approve a reduction in such form each year or that we will be able to meet the other legal requirements for a reduction in par value, or that swiss withholding tax rules will not be changed in the future. we estimate we would be able to pay dividends in such form, and thus exempt from swiss withholding tax until 2023-2028. this range may vary depending upon changes in annual dividends, special dividends, fluctuations in u.s. dollar/swiss franc exchange rates, changes in par value or qualifying capital contribution reserves or changes or new interpretations to swiss corporate or tax law or regulations. under certain circumstances, u. s. shareholders may be subject to adverse u.s. federal income tax consequences. under certain circumstances, a u.s. person who owns 10 percent or more of the voting power of a foreign corporation that is a \"controlled foreign corporation\" (cfc) (a foreign corporation in which 10 percent u.s. shareholders own more than 50 percent of the voting power or value of the stock of a foreign corporation or more than 25 percent of certain foreign insurance corporations) for an uninterrupted period of 30 days or more during a taxable year must include in gross income for u.s. federal income tax purposes such \"10 percent u.s. shareholder's\" pro rata share of the cfc's \"subpart f income\". we believe that because of the dispersion of our share ownership, provisions in our organizational documents that limit voting power, and other factors, no u.s. person or u.s. partnership who acquires shares of ace limited directly or indirectly through one or more foreign entities should be required to include our subpart f income in income under the cfc rules of u.s. tax law. it is possible, however, that the irs could challenge the effectiveness of these provisions and that a court could sustain such a challenge, in which case the investment could be adversely affected if 10 percent or more of ace limited's stock is owned. separately, any u.s. persons who hold shares may be subject to u.s. federal income taxation at ordinary income tax rates on their proportionate share of our related person insurance income (rpii). if the rpii of any of our non-u.s. insurance subsidiaries (each a \"non-u.s. insurance subsidiary\") were to equal or exceed 20 percent of that company's gross insurance income in any taxable year and direct or indirect insureds (and persons related to those insureds) own directly or indirectly through foreign entities 20 percent or more of the voting power or value of ace limited, then a u.s. person who owns any shares of ace limited (directly or indirectly through foreign entities) on the last day of the taxable year would be required to include in his or her income for u.s. federal income tax purposes such person's pro rata share of such company's rpii for the entire taxable year. in addition, any rpii that is includible in the income of a u.s. tax-exempt organization may be treated as unrelated business taxable income. we believe that the gross rpii of each non-u.s. insurance subsidiary did not in prior years of operation and is not expected in the foreseeable future to equal or exceed 20 percent of each such company's gross insurance income. likewise, we do not expect the direct or indirect insureds of each non-u.s. insurance subsidiary (and persons related 28 to such insureds) to directly or indirectly own 20 percent or more of either the voting power or value of our shares. however, we cannot be certain that this will be the case because some of the factors which determine the extent of rpii may be beyond our control. if these thresholds are met or exceeded, any u.s. person's investment in ace limited could be adversely affected. a u.s. tax-exempt organization may recognize unrelated business taxable income if a portion of our insurance income is allocated to the organization. this generally would be the case if either we are a cfc and the tax-exempt shareholder is a 10 percent u.s. shareholder or there is rpii, certain exceptions do not apply, and the tax-exempt organization, directly or indirectly through foreign entities, owns any shares of ace limited. although we do not believe that any u.s. tax-exempt organization should be allocated such insurance income, we cannot be certain that this will be the case. potential u.s. tax-exempt investors are advised to consult their tax advisors. u.s. persons who hold shares will be subject to adverse tax consequences if we are considered to be a passive foreign investment company (pfic) for u.s. federal income tax purposes. if ace limited is considered a pfic for u.s. federal income tax purposes, a u.s. person who holds ace limited shares will be subject to adverse u.s. federal income tax consequences in which case their investment could be adversely affected. in addition, if ace limited were considered a pfic, upon the death of any u.s. individual owning shares, such individual's heirs or estate would not be entitled to a \"step-up\" in the basis of the shares which might otherwise be available under u.s. federal income tax laws. we believe that we are not, have not been, and currently do not expect to become, a pfic for u.s. federal income tax purposes. we cannot assure, however, that we will not be deemed a pfic by the irs. while there are currently no regulations regarding the application of the pfic provisions to an insurance company, new regulations or pronouncements interpreting or clarifying these rules may be forthcoming. we cannot predict what impact, if any, such guidance would have on an investor that is subject to u.s. federal income taxation. changes in tax law could adversely affect an investment in our shares. legislation is periodically introduced in the u.s. congress intended to eliminate some perceived tax advantages of companies (including insurance companies) that have legal domiciles outside the u.s. but have certain u.s. connections. it is possible that such legislation or other legislation could be enacted in the future that could have an adverse impact on us or our shareholders. similarly, jurisdictions outside the u.s. in which we do business could enact tax legislation in the future that could have an adverse impact on us or our shareholders. for example, switzerland is currently considering corporate tax reform measures that could adversely affect us or our shareholders. item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of our results of operations, financial

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ overview we operate through five business segments: insurance - north american p&c, insurance - north american agriculture, insurance - overseas general, global reinsurance, and life. for more information on our segments refer to \"segment information\" under item 1. we have grown our business through increased premium volume, expansion of product offerings and geographic reach, and acquisitions of other companies. the insurance - overseas general segment has recently expanded its operations through the following acquisitions in 2014, 2013, and 2012: • the large corporate account property and casualty (p&amp;c) insurance business of itaú seguros (itaú seguros) (october 31, 2014); • the siam commercial samaggi insurance pcl (samaggi) (we and our local partner acquired 60.86 percent ownership on april 28, 2014, and subsequently acquired an additional 32.17 percent ownership through a mandatory tender offer, which expired on june 17, 2014); • aba seguros (may 2, 2013); • fianzas monterrey (april 1, 2013); and • pt asuransi jaya proteksi (japro) (we acquired 80 percent on september 18, 2012, and our local partner acquired the remaining 20 percent on january 3, 2013). the consolidated financial statements include results of acquired businesses from the acquisition dates. refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our acquisitions. our product and geographic diversification differentiates us from the vast majority of our competitors and has been a source of stability during periods of industry volatility. our long-term business strategy focuses on sustained growth in book value achieved through a combination of underwriting and investment income. by doing so, we provide value to our clients and shareholders through use of our substantial capital base in the insurance and reinsurance markets. we are organized along a profit center structure by line of business and territory that does not necessarily correspond to corporate legal entities. profit centers can access various legal entities, subject to licensing and other regulatory rules. profit centers are expected to generate underwriting income and appropriate risk-adjusted returns. our corporate structure has facilitated the development of management talent by giving each profit center's senior management team the necessary autonomy within underwriting authorities to make operating decisions and create products and coverages needed by its target customer base. we are focused on delivering underwriting profit and strive to achieve underwriting income by only writing policies which we believe adequately compensate us for the risk we accept. our insurance and reinsurance operations generate gross revenues from two principal sources: premiums and investment income. cash flow is generated from premiums collected and investment income received less paid losses and loss expenses, policy acquisition costs, and administrative expenses. invested assets are substantially held in liquid, investment grade fixed income securities of relatively short duration. claims payments in any short-term period are highly unpredictable due to the random nature of loss events and the timing of claims awards or settlements. the value of investments held to pay future claims is subject to market forces such as the level of interest rates, stock market volatility, and credit events such as corporate defaults. the actual cost of claims is also volatile based on loss trends, inflation rates, court awards, and catastrophes. we believe that our cash balance, our highly liquid investments, credit facilities, and reinsurance protection provide sufficient liquidity to meet unforeseen claim demands that might occur in the year ahead. refer to \"liquidity\" and \"capital resources\" for additional information. 36 _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ financial highlights for the year ended december 31, 2014 • total company net premiums written increased 4.6 percent, or 5.7 percent on a constant-dollar basis. • p&amp;c combined ratio was 87.7 percent compared with 88.0 percent in 2013. the gaap combined ratio was 88.1 percent compared with 88.0 percent in 2013. • the current accident year p&amp;c combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses was 89.3 percent compared with 90.0 percent in 2013. • the p&amp;c expense ratio was 29.4 percent compared with 28.4 percent in 2013. • total pre-tax and after-tax catastrophe losses including reinstatement premiums were $288 million (1.8 percentage points of the combined ratio) and $249 million, respectively, compared with $227 million (1.7 percentage points of the combined ratio) and $197 million, respectively, in 2013. • favorable prior period development pre-tax and after-tax were $527 million (3.4 percentage points of the combined ratio) and $459 million, respectively, compared with $530 million (3.7 percentage points of the combined ratio) and $450 million, respectively, in 2013. • operating cash flow was $4.5 billion compared with $4.0 billion in 2013. • net investment income was $2.3 billion compared with $2.1 billion in 2013. • net income decreased 24.1 percent to $2.9 billion. net income in 2014 was negatively impacted compared to 2013 as a result of the mark to market accounting associated with our living benefit variable annuity reinsurance business. the relative difference is primarily due to interest rates, which fell during 2014 after rising during 2013. • share repurchases totaled $1.4 billion, or approximately 14 million shares in 2014. we reported strong premium revenue growth and combined ratios in 2014 with all divisions contributing positively to our results. growth was broad-based from all regions, reflecting our diversified business by product, geography, customer and distribution. in addition to producing strong financial results, we made numerous investments intended for future growth and earnings. for example, we launched retail distribution to complement our existing wholesale capabilities for our u.s. middle market specialty and excess & surplus business; we started a new micro business division to serve very small u.s. commercial businesses; we made acquisitions in thailand and brazil, further expanding our presence and capabilities in promising developing markets. and we signed a definitive agreement in december 2014 to acquire the fireman's fund high net worth personal lines business. this acquisition will complement our existing personal lines business, which has tripled in size in the last five years. our personal lines business is a strategic growth area and poised to continue its growth globally. these are some of the investments we made in the future of our company that will strengthen our presence and capabilities and increase our ability to produce sustainable outperformance. we are off to a good start in 2015 and we remain confident in our strategy and are relentless in our drive to execute with excellence. 37 _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements include amounts that, either by their nature or due to requirements of generally accepted accounting principles in the u.s. (gaap), are determined using best estimates and assumptions. while we believe that the amounts included in our consolidated financial statements reflect our best judgment, actual amounts could ultimately materially differ from those currently presented. we believe the items that require the most subjective and complex estimates are: • unpaid loss and loss expense reserves, including long-tail asbestos and environmental (a&amp;e) reserves; • future policy benefits reserves; • the valuation of value of business acquired (voba) and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and voba; • the assessment of risk transfer for certain structured insurance and reinsurance contracts; • reinsurance recoverable, including a provision for uncollectible reinsurance; • the valuation of our investment portfolio and assessment of other-than-temporary impairments (otti); • the valuation of deferred tax assets; • the valuation of derivative instruments related to guaranteed living benefits (glb); and • the valuation of goodwill. we believe our accounting policies for these items are of critical importance to our consolidated financial statements. the following discussion provides more information regarding the estimates and assumptions required to arrive at these amounts and should be read in conjunction with the sections entitled: prior period development, asbestos and environmental (a&e), reinsurance recoverable on ceded reinsurance, investments, net realized and unrealized gains (losses), and other (income) and expense items. unpaid losses and loss expenses as an insurance and reinsurance company, we are required by applicable laws and regulations and gaap to establish loss and loss expense reserves for the estimated unpaid portion of the ultimate liability for losses and loss expenses under the terms of our policies and agreements with our insured and reinsured customers. at december 31, 2014, our gross unpaid loss and loss expense reserves were $38.3 billion and our net unpaid loss and loss expense reserves were $27.0 billion. with the exception of certain structured settlements, for which the timing and amount of future claim payments are reliably determinable, and certain reserves for unsettled claims that are discounted in statutory filings, our loss reserves are not discounted for the time value of money. in connection with such structured settlements and certain reserves for unsettled claims, we carried net discounted reserves of $111 million and $106 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the following table

expenses associated with processing and settling unpaid claims (loss expenses). 38 the following table segregates loss reserves by three broad line of business groupings: property and all other, casualty, and a&h (or personal accident). in the table, loss expenses are defined to include unallocated and allocated loss adjustment expenses. december 31, 2014 december 31, 2013 (in millions of

$27,008 $37,443 $10,612 $26,831 the process of establishing loss reserves for property and casualty claims can be complex and is subject to considerable uncertainty as it requires the use of informed estimates and judgments based on circumstances underlying the insured loss known at the date of accrual. for example, the reserves established for high excess casualty claims, asbestos and environmental claims, claims from major catastrophic events or for our various product lines each require different assumptions and judgments to be made. necessary judgments are based on numerous factors and may be revised as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed, as new or improved methods are developed, or as laws change. hence, ultimate loss payments may differ from the estimate of the ultimate liabilities made at the balance sheet date. changes to our previous estimates of prior period loss reserves impact the reported calendar year underwriting results, adversely if our estimates increase and favorably if our estimates decrease. the potential for variation in loss reserve estimates is impacted by numerous factors, which we discuss below. in particular, these considerations differ markedly depending upon whether case or ibnr reserves are being established. reserve estimates for casualty lines are particularly uncertain given the lengthy reporting patterns and corresponding need for ibnr. case reserves for those claims reported by insureds or ceding companies to us prior to the balance sheet date, and where we have sufficient information, are determined by our claims personnel as appropriate based on the circumstances of the claim(s), standard claim handling practices, and professional judgment. furthermore, for our brandywine run-off operations and our assumed reinsurance operation, global reinsurance, we may adjust the ceded case reserves as notified by the ceding company via use of an additional case reserve if the judgment of our respective claims department differs from that of the cedant (see also the assumed reinsurance section below). with respect to ibnr reserves, and those claims that have been incurred but not reported prior to the balance sheet date, there is, by definition, limited actual information to form the case reserve estimate and reliance is placed upon historical loss experience and actuarial methods to estimate the ultimate loss obligations and the corresponding amount of ibnr. ibnr reserve estimates are generally calculated by first projecting the ultimate amount of losses for a product line and subtracting paid losses and case reserves for reported claims. the judgments involved in projecting the ultimate losses may pertain to the use and interpretation of various standard actuarial reserving methods that place reliance on the extrapolation of actual 39 historical data, loss development patterns, and industry data, and other benchmarks as appropriate. the estimate of the required ibnr reserve also requires judgment by actuaries and management to reflect the impact of more contemporary and subjective factors, both qualitative and quantitative. among some of these factors that might be considered are changes in business mix or volume, changes in ceded reinsurance structures, changes in claims handling practices, reported and projected loss trends, inflation, the legal environment, and the terms and conditions of the contracts sold to our insured parties. determining management's best estimate our recorded reserves represent management's best estimate of the provision for unpaid claims as of the balance sheet date. management's best estimate is developed after collaboration with actuarial, underwriting, claims, legal, and finance departments and culminates with the input of reserve committees. each business unit reserve committee includes the participation of the relevant parties from actuarial, finance, claims, and unit senior management and has the responsibility for finalizing and approving the estimate to be used as management's best estimate. reserves are further reviewed by ace's chief actuary and senior management. the objective of such a process is to determine a single estimate that we believe represents a better estimate than any other and which is viewed by management to be the best estimate of ultimate loss settlements. this estimate is generally based on a combination of exposure and experience based actuarial methods (described below) and other considerations such as claims reviews, reinsurance recovery assumptions and/or input from other subject matter experts such as underwriting. exposure-based methods are most commonly used on relatively immature origin years while experience-based methods provide a view based on the projection of loss experience that has emerged as of the valuation date. greater reliance is placed upon experience-based methods as the pool of emerging loss experience grows and where it is deemed sufficiently credible and reliable as the basis for the estimate. in comparing the held reserve for any given origin year to the actuarial projections, judgment is required as to the credibility, uncertainty and inherent limitations of applying actuarial techniques to historical data to project future loss experience. examples of factors that impact such judgments include, but are not limited to, the following: • nature and complexity of underlying coverage provided and net limits of exposure provided; • segmentation of data to provide sufficient homogeneity and credibility for loss projection methods; • extent of credible internal historical loss data and reliance upon industry information as required; • historical variability of actual loss emergence compared with expected loss emergence; • extent of emerged loss experience relative to the remaining expected period of loss emergence; • rate monitor information for new and renewal business; • facts and circumstances of large claims; • impact of applicable reinsurance recoveries; and • nature and extent of underlying assumptions. management does not build in any specific provision for uncertainty. we do not calculate ranges of loss reserve estimates for our individual loss reserve studies, given the lack of robust statistical approaches and the limited usefulness for such information in decision making. determining such ranges is a complex and uncertain process, and such ranges generally do not capture the potential changes in external and internal circumstances between the balance sheet date and the final settlement date that may impact the ultimate value of loss. while we believe that our recorded reserves are reasonable and represent management's best estimate for each product line as of the current valuation date, future changes to our view of the ultimate liabilities are possible. a five percent change in our net loss reserves equates to $1.4 billion and represents five percent of shareholders' equity at december 31, 2014. historically our reserves, at times, have developed in excess of 10 percent of recorded amounts. refer to \"analysis of losses and loss expenses development\", under item 1, for a summary of historical volatility between estimated loss reserves and ultimate loss settlements. we have actuarial staff within each of our business units who analyze loss reserves and regularly project estimates of ultimate losses and the corresponding indications of the required ibnr reserve. note that losses include loss expenses for the purposes of this discussion. we perform an actuarial reserve review for each product line at least once a year. at the conclusion of each review, we establish an actuarial central estimate. the process to select the actuarial central estimate, when more than one estimate is available, may differ across product lines. for example, an actuary may base the central estimate on loss projections developed using an incurred loss development approach instead of a paid loss development approach when reported losses are viewed to be a more credible indication of the ultimate loss compared with paid losses. the availability of estimates 40 for different projection techniques will depend upon the product line, the underwriting circumstances, and the maturity of the loss emergence. for a well-established product line with sufficient volume and history and low volatility, the actuarial central estimate may be drawn from a weighting of paid and reported loss development and/or bornhuetter-ferguson methods (described below). however, for a new long-tail product line for which we have limited data and experience, a rapidly growing line, or an established line with volatile experience, the emerging loss experience may not have sufficient credibility to allow selection of loss development or bornhuetter-ferguson methods and reliance may be placed upon the expected loss ratio method (described below) until the experience matures and becomes credible. typically, for each product line, one or more standard actuarial reserving methods may be used to estimate ultimate losses and loss expenses, and from these estimates, a single actuarial central estimate is selected. exceptions to the use of standard actuarial projection methods occur for individual claims of significance that require complex legal, claims, and actuarial analysis and judgment (for example, a&e account projections or high excess casualty/professional lines accounts in litigation) or for product lines where the nature of the claims experience and/or availability of the data prevent application of such standard methods. in addition, claims arising from certain catastrophic events require evaluations that do not utilize standard actuarial loss projection methods but are based upon our exposure at the time of the event and the circumstances of the catastrophe and its post-event impact. in addition to the annual loss reserve studies performed for each product line, we review the emergence of actual losses relative to expectations for most product lines each quarter. if warranted from findings in loss emergence tests, we may alter the timing of our product line reserve studies. finally, loss reserve studies are performed annually by external third-parties and the findings are used to provide management an independent assessment of our internal findings. standard actuarial reserving methods standard actuarial reserving methods include, but are not limited to, expected loss ratio, paid and reported loss development, and bornhuetter-ferguson methods. a general description of these methods is provided below. in the subsequent discussion on short-tail and long-tail business, reference is also made, where appropriate, to how consideration in method selection impacted 2014 results. in addition to these standard methods, depending upon the product line characteristics and available data we may use other recognized actuarial methods and approaches. to ensure that the projections of future loss emergence based on historical loss development patterns are representative of the underlying business, historical loss and premium data is required to be of sufficient homogeneity and credibility. for example, to improve data homogeneity, we may subdivide product line data further by similar risk attribute (e.g., geography, coverage such as property versus liability exposure, or elements of program structure such as attachments or limits), project ultimate losses for these homogeneous groups and then combine the results to provide the overall product line estimate. the premium and loss data are aggregated by origin year (e.g., the year in which the losses were incurred - \"accident year\" or \"report year\") and annual or quarterly development periods, and data at all valuations is converted at the same foreign exchange rates in order to avoid distortions from exchange rate movements over time. implicit in the standard actuarial methods that we generally utilize is the need for two fundamental assumptions: first, the pattern by which losses are expected to emerge over time for each origin year, and second the expected loss ratio for each origin year. the expected loss ratio for any particular origin year is selected after consideration of a number of factors, including historical loss ratios adjusted for rate changes, premium and loss trends, industry benchmarks, the results of policy level loss modeling at the time of underwriting, and/or other more subjective considerations for the product line (e.g., terms and conditions) and external environment as noted above. the expected loss ratio for a given origin year is initially established at the start of the origin year as part of the planning process. this analysis is performed in conjunction with underwriters and management. the expected loss ratio method arrives at an ultimate loss estimate by multiplying the expected ultimate loss ratio by the corresponding premium base. this method is most commonly used as the basis for the actuarial central estimate for immature origin periods on product lines where the actual paid or reported loss experience is not yet deemed sufficiently credible to serve as the principal basis for the selection of ultimate losses. the expected loss ratio for a given origin year may be modified over time if the underlying assumptions differ from the original assumptions (for example, the assessment of prior year loss ratios, loss trend, rate changes, actual claims, or other information). our selected paid and reported development patterns provide a benchmark against which the actual emerging loss experience can be monitored. where possible, development patterns are selected based on historical loss emergence by origin year with appropriate allowance for changes in business mix, claims handling process, and/or ceded reinsurance that are likely to lead to a discernible difference between the rate of historical and future loss emergence. for product lines where the historical data is viewed to have low statistical credibility, the selected development patterns also reflect relevant industry benchmarks and/or experience from similar product lines written elsewhere within ace. this most commonly occurs for relatively new product lines that have limited historical data or for high severity/low frequency portfolios where our historical experience exhibits 41 considerable volatility and/or lacks credibility. the paid and reported loss development methods convert the selected loss emergence pattern to a set of multiplicative factors which are then applied to actual paid or reported losses to arrive at an estimate of ultimate losses for each period. due to their multiplicative nature, the paid and reported loss development methods will leverage differences between actual and expected loss emergence. these methods tend to be utilized for more mature origin periods and for those portfolios where the loss emergence has been relatively consistent over time. the bornhuetter-ferguson method is essentially a combination of the expected loss ratio method and the loss development method, where the loss development method is given more weight as the origin year matures. this approach allows a logical transition between the expected loss ratio method which is generally utilized at earlier maturities and the loss development methods which are typically utilized at later maturities. we usually apply this method using reported loss data although paid data may also be used. the applicability of actuarial methods will also be impacted by the attachment point of the policy or contract with the insured or ceding company. in the case of low attachment points typical of primary insurance or working layer reinsurance, the experience tends to be more frequency driven. for these product types, standard actuarial methods are generally applicable in determining loss reserve levels given sufficient history and credible loss experience (although still subject to the same limitations and uncertainties described elsewhere in this section, for example, changing inflationary or legal environments). in the case of high attachment points typical of excess insurance or excess of loss reinsurance, the experience tends to be severity driven, as only a loss of significant size will enter the layer. for these product lines, it typically takes longer for loss experience to gain credibility, which adds uncertainty to the estimates derived from standard actuarial methods. for products such as our assumed reinsurance business, we typically supplement the standard actuarial methods with an analysis of each contract's terms, original pricing information, subsequent internal and external analyses of the ongoing contracts, market exposures and history, and qualitative input from claims managers. this approach is also used for structured or unique contracts. short-tail and long-tail business the time period between the date of loss occurrence and the final payment date of the ensuing claim(s) is referred to as the \"claim-tail.\" the following is a discussion of specific reserving considerations for both short-tail and long-tail product lines. in this section, we reference the nature of recent prior period development to give a high-level understanding of how these considerations translate through the reserving process into financial decisions. refer to note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on prior period development. short-tail business short-tail business generally describes product lines for which losses are typically known and paid shortly after the loss actually occurs. this would include, for example, most property, personal accident, aviation hull, and automobile physical damage policies that we write. there are some exceptions on certain product lines or events (e.g., major hurricanes or aviation crashes) where the event has occurred, but the final settlement amount is highly uncertain (e.g., coverage disputes or liability-related claims) and not known with certainty for a potentially lengthy period. due to the short reporting and development pattern for these product lines, the uncertainty associated with our estimate of ultimate losses for any particular accident period diminishes relatively quickly as actual loss experience emerges. we typically assign credibility to methods that incorporate actual loss emergence, such as the paid and reported loss development and bornhuetter-ferguson methods, sooner than would be the case for long-tail lines at a similar stage of development for a given origin year. the reserving process for short-tail losses arising from catastrophic events typically involves an assessment by the claims department, in conjunction with underwriters and actuaries, of our exposure and estimated losses immediately following an event and then subsequent revisions of the estimated losses as our insureds provide updated actual loss information. for origin year 2014, loss reserves for short-tail lines were typically established for the non-catastrophe exposures using a combination of the initial expected loss ratio method (see above) and loss development methods that incorporate actual loss emergence. as the year progressed, we also adjusted these reserves for non-catastrophe large loss activity that we considered to be greater or less than the assumptions used to establish the initial expected loss ratio. catastrophe activity was relatively low in 2014 and accordingly the judgments and uncertainties used to establish reserves for incurred catastrophe events were correspondingly less complex. for our short-tail businesses taken as a whole, overall loss trend assumptions did not differ significantly relative to prior years. in terms of prior accident years, the bulk of the changes made in the 2014 calendar year arose from origin years 2010 through 2012. specifically, the insurance - north american p&c, insurance - overseas general, and global reinsurance segments experienced $56 million, $210 million, and $11 million of favorable prior period development, respectively, primarily due to lower than anticipated loss emergence rather than any significant changes to underlying actuarial assumptions such as loss 42 development patterns. this favorable prior period development was primarily the result of changes to the ultimate loss estimates for origin years 2011 and 2012 for insurance - north american p&c, origin years 2010 through 2013 for insurance - overseas general, and origin year 2012 for global reinsurance. insurance - north american agriculture experienced $34 million of adverse prior period development primarily due to higher than expected claim development for the 2013 crop year in our multiple peril crop insurance business. long-tail business long-tail business describes lines of business for which specific losses may not be known/reported for some period and for which claims can take significant time to settle/close. this includes most casualty lines such as general liability, d&o, and workers' compensation. there are various factors contributing to the uncertainty and volatility of long-tail business. among these are: • the nature and complexity of underlying coverage provided and net limits of exposure provided; • our historical loss data and experience is sometimes too immature and lacking in credibility to rely upon for reserving purposes. where this is the case, in our reserve analysis we may utilize industry loss ratios or industry benchmark development patterns that we believe reflect the nature and coverage of the underwritten business and its future development, where available. for such product lines, actual loss experience may differ from industry loss statistics as well as loss experience for previous underwriting years; • the considerable inherent uncertainty around loss trends, claims inflation (e.g., medical and judicial) and underlying economic conditions; • the inherent uncertainty of the estimated duration of the paid and reported loss development patterns beyond the historical record requires that professional judgment be used in the determination of the length of the patterns based on the historical data and other information; • the inherent uncertainty of assuming that historical paid and reported loss development patterns for older origin years will be representative of subsequent loss emergence on recent origin years. for example, changes over time in the processes and procedures for establishing case reserves can distort reported loss development patterns or changes in ceded reinsurance structures by origin year can alter the development of paid and reported losses; • loss reserve analyses typically require loss or other data be grouped by common characteristics in some manner. if data from two combined lines of business exhibit different characteristics, such as loss payment patterns, the credibility of the reserve estimate could be affected. additionally, since casualty lines of business can have significant intricacies in the terms and conditions afforded to the insured, there is an inherent risk as to the homogeneity of the underlying data used in performing reserve analyses; and • the applicability of the price change data used to estimate ultimate loss ratios for most recent origin years. as can be seen from the above, various factors are considered when determining appropriate data, assumptions, and methods used to establish the loss reserve estimates for long-tail product lines. these factors may also vary by origin year for given product lines. the derivation of loss development patterns from data and the selection of a tail factor to project ultimate losses from actual loss emergence require considerable judgment, particularly with respect to the extent to which historical loss experience is relied upon to support changes in key reserving assumptions. examples of the relationship between changes in historical loss experience and key reserving assumptions are provided below. for those long-tail product lines that are less claim frequency and more claim severity oriented, such as high excess professional and casualty lines, we placed more reliance upon expert legal and claims review of the specific circumstances underlying reported cases rather than loss development patterns. where appropriate, we then supplemented this with loss development and bornhuetter-ferguson approaches to provide for claims that have been reported but are too immature to develop individual claims estimates and also to provide for claims that have occurred but have not been reported. the assumptions used for these lines of business are updated over time to reflect new claim and legal advice judged to be of significance. for origin year 2014, loss reserves were typically established through the application of individual product line expected loss ratios, as discussed earlier. our assumptions on loss trend and development patterns reflect reliance on our historical loss data provided the length and volume of history and homogeneity afford credibility. for those lines where our internal historical experience lacks credibility, we may place reliance upon the latest benchmark patterns (where available) from external industry bodies such as insurance services office (iso) or the national council on compensation insurance, inc. (ncci). in such cases, the assumptions used to project ultimate loss estimates will not fully reflect our own actual loss experience until our data is deemed sufficiently credible. we note that industry patterns are not always available to match the nature of the business being written; this issue is particularly problematic for non-u.s. exposed lines. given the underlying volatility of the long-tail product 43 lines and the lengthy period required for full paid and reported loss emergence, we typically assign little to no credibility to actual loss emergence that is lower than expected in the early development periods. accordingly, we generally used the expected loss ratio method for the 2014 and immediately preceding origin years to establish reserves by product line. we monitor actual paid and reported loss emergence relative to expected loss emergence for most individual product lines. as described earlier, the process to develop origin year 2014 reserves for our long-tail casualty business relies on estimates of ultimate and historical loss ratios for prior origin years adjusted to current levels through the use of key assumptions like expected rate change and loss trend. when estimating the ultimate loss levels for these prior origin years for the major long-tail lines in insurance - north american p&c, insurance - overseas general, and global reinsurance no changes of significance were made to the loss development patterns. while we generally use trends observed in internal and/or industry data to adjust prior year losses to current levels, we have made no material changes to the prospective loss trends used to develop ultimate loss ratios for origin year 2014. for long-tail portfolios where actual loss emergence in calendar year 2014 was lower than expected for the more recent origin years, the deviation was not typically seen as sufficiently credible, particularly given the volatility and lengthy period for full loss emergence, to fully reflect in our booked ultimate loss selections or the actuarial assumptions underlying the reserve reviews. however, for certain product lines with early loss emergence on more recent origin years that was greater than expected, we did respond where we believed that such adverse emergence was generally significant relative to the loss emergence assumptions (e.g., origin years 2012 and 2013 for casualty and financial lines in insurance - overseas general). such judgments were made with due consideration to the factors impacting reserve uncertainty as discussed above. the reserve actions that we took in 2014 are discussed further below and in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. for more mature origin years, typically 2010 and prior, we gave meaningful weight to indicated ultimates derived from methods that rely on the paid and reported loss development patterns based on our own historical experience where sufficient credibility was deemed to exist. as noted previously, this is consistent with our practice of allowing favorable loss emergence sufficient time to be reliably established before assigning partial or full credibility. the prior period development in 2014 for long-tail lines of business comprised several main components. first, we experienced favorable prior period development on a number of product lines where actual loss emergence was lower than expected and/or increased weighting was given to experience-based methods as relevant origin years mature (typically 2010 and prior). in particular, this included d&o, medical risk operations, and financial solutions business in insurance - north american p&c ($179 million favorable) principally in origin years 2009 and 2010, casualty and financial lines in insurance - overseas general for origin years 2010 and prior ($246 million favorable), and origin years 2009 and prior for long-tail product lines in global reinsurance ($63 million favorable). second, we recorded both favorable and adverse reserve actions in response to development on specific large claims. third, we experienced adverse development from insurance - north american p&c run-off operations including westchester and brandywine run-off operations ($247 million). the causes for the westchester and brandywine operations are described further below. sensitivity to underlying assumptions while we believe that our reserve for unpaid losses and loss expenses at december 31, 2014, is adequate, new information or emerging trends that differ from our assumptions may lead to future development of losses and loss expenses that is significantly greater or less than the recorded reserve, which could have a material effect on future operating results. as noted previously, our best estimate of required loss reserves for most portfolios is judgmentally selected for each origin year after considering the results from a number of reserving methods and is not a purely mechanical process. therefore, it is difficult to convey, in a simple and quantitative manner, the impact that a change to a single assumption will have on our best estimate. in the examples below, we attempt to give an indication of the potential impact by isolating a single change for a specific reserving method that would be pertinent in establishing the best estimate for the product line described. we consider each of the following sensitivity analyses to represent a reasonably likely deviation in the underlying assumption. insurance - north american p&c given the long reporting and paid development patterns for workers' compensation business, the development factors used to project actual current losses to ultimate losses for our current exposure requires considerable judgment that could be material to consolidated loss and loss expense reserves. specifically, adjusting ground up ultimate losses by a one percent change in the tail factor (i.e., 1.04 changed to either 1.05 or 1.03) would cause a change of approximately $432 million, either positive or negative, for the projected net loss and loss expense reserves. this represents an impact of 10 percent relative to recorded net loss and loss expense reserves of approximately $4.3 billion. 44 the reserve portfolio for our ace bermuda operations contains exposure to predominantly high excess liability coverage on an occurrence-first-reported basis (typically with attachment points in excess of $325 million and gross limits of up to $150 million) and d&o and other professional liability coverage on a claims-made basis (typically with attachment points in excess of $125 million and gross limits of up to $75 million). due to the layer of exposure covered, the expected frequency for this book is very low. as a result of the low frequency/high severity nature of the book, a small difference in the actual vs. expected claim frequency, either positive or negative, could result in a material change to the projected ultimate loss if such change in claim frequency was related to a policy where close to maximum limits were deployed. insurance - north american agriculture approximately 80 percent of the reserves for this segment are from the crop related lines, which all have short payout patterns, with the majority of the liabilities expected to be resolved in the ensuing twelve months. reserves for our multiple peril crop insurance (mpci) product are set on a case-by-case basis and our aggregate exposure is subject to state level risk sharing formulae as well as third-party reinsurance. the majority of the development risk arises out of the accuracy of case reserve estimates. we do not view our agriculture reserves as substantially influenced by the general assumptions and risks underlying more typical p&c reserve estimates. insurance - overseas general certain long-tail lines, such as casualty and professional lines, are particularly susceptible to changes in loss trend and claim inflation. heightened perceptions of tort and settlement awards around the world are increasing the demand for these products as well as contributing to the uncertainty in the reserving estimates. our reserving methods rely on loss development patterns estimated from historical data and while we attempt to adjust such factors for known changes in the current tort environment, it is possible that such factors may not entirely reflect all recent trends in tort environments. for example, when applying the reported loss development method, the lengthening of our selected loss development patterns by six months would increase reserve estimates on long-tail casualty and professional lines for accident years 2012 and prior by approximately $281 million. this represents an impact of 12.1 percent relative to recorded net loss and loss expense reserves of approximately $2.3 billion. global reinsurance typically, there is inherent uncertainty around the length of paid and reported development patterns, especially for certain casualty lines such as excess workers' compensation or general liability, which may take up to 30 years to fully develop. this uncertainty is accentuated by the need to supplement client development patterns with industry development patterns due to the sometimes low credibility of the data. the underlying source and selection of the final development patterns can thus have a significant impact on the selected ultimate net losses and loss expenses. for example, a 20 percent shortening or lengthening of the development patterns used for u.s. long-tail lines would cause the loss reserve estimate derived by the reported bornhuetter-ferguson method for these lines to change by approximately $430 million. this represents an impact of 37 percent relative to recorded net loss and loss expense reserves of approximately $1.2 billion. assumed reinsurance at december 31, 2014, net unpaid losses and loss expenses for the global reinsurance segment aggregated to $2.0 billion, consisting of $872 million of case reserves and $1.1 billion of ibnr. in comparison, at december 31, 2013, net unpaid losses and loss expenses for the global reinsurance segment aggregated to $2.2 billion, consisting of $938 million of case reserves and $1.2 billion of ibnr. for catastrophe business, we principally estimate unpaid losses and loss expenses on an event basis by considering various sources of information, including specific loss estimates reported by our cedants, ceding company and overall industry loss estimates reported by our brokers, and our internal data regarding reinsured exposures related to the geographical location of the event. our internal data analysis enables us to establish catastrophe reserves for known events with more certainty at an earlier date than would be the case if we solely relied on reports from third parties to determine carried reserves. for our casualty reinsurance business, we generally rely on ceding companies to report claims and then use that data as a key input to estimate unpaid losses and loss expenses. due to the reliance on claims information reported by ceding companies, as well as other factors, the estimation of unpaid losses and loss expenses for assumed reinsurance includes certain risks and uncertainties that are unique relative to our direct insurance business. these include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: • the reported claims information could be inaccurate; • typically, a lag exists between the reporting of a loss event to a ceding company and its reporting to us as a reinsurance claim. the use of a broker to transmit financial information from a ceding company to us increases the reporting lag. 45 because most of our reinsurance business is produced by brokers, ceding companies generally first submit claim and other financial information to brokers, who then report the proportionate share of such information to each reinsurer of a particular treaty. the reporting lag generally results in a longer period of time between the date a claim is incurred and the date a claim is reported compared with direct insurance operations. therefore, the risk of delayed recognition of loss reserve development is higher for assumed reinsurance than for direct insurance lines; and • the historical claims data for a particular reinsurance contract can be limited relative to our insurance business in that there may be less historical information available. further, for certain coverages or products, such as excess of loss contracts, there may be relatively few expected claims in a particular year so the actual number of claims may be susceptible to significant variability. in such cases, the actuary often relies on industry data from several recognized sources. we mitigate the above risks in several ways. in addition to routine analytical reviews of ceding company reports to ensure reported claims information appears reasonable, we perform regular underwriting and claims audits of certain ceding companies to ensure reported claims information is accurate, complete, and timely. as appropriate, audit findings are used to adjust claims in the reserving process. we also use our knowledge of the historical development of losses from individual ceding companies to adjust the level of adequacy we believe exists in the reported ceded losses. on occasion, there will be differences between our carried loss reserves and unearned premium reserves and the amount of loss reserves and unearned premium reserves reported by the ceding companies. this is due to the fact that we receive consistent and timely information from ceding companies only with respect to case reserves. for ibnr, we use historical experience and other statistical information, depending on the type of business, to estimate the ultimate loss. we estimate our unearned premium reserve by applying estimated earning patterns to net premiums written for each treaty based upon that treaty's coverage basis (i.e., risks attaching or losses occurring). at december 31, 2014, the case reserves reported to us by our ceding companies were $851 million, compared with the $872 million we recorded. our policy is to post additional case reserves in addition to the amounts reported by our cedants when our evaluation of the ultimate value of a reported claim is different than the evaluation of that claim by our cedant. within the insurance - north american p&c segment, we also have exposure to certain liability reinsurance lines that have been in run-off since 1994. unpaid losses and loss expenses relating to this run-off reinsurance business resides within the brandywine division of our insurance - north american p&c segment. most of the remaining unpaid loss and loss expense reserves for the run-off reinsurance business relate to a&e claims. refer to the \"asbestos and environmental (a&e)\" section for additional information. asbestos and environmental reserves included in our liabilities for losses and loss expenses are amounts for a&e (a&e liabilities). the a&e liabilities principally relate to claims arising from bodily-injury claims related to asbestos products and remediation costs associated with hazardous waste sites. the estimation of our a&e liabilities is particularly sensitive to future changes in the legal, social, and economic environment. we have not assumed any such future changes in setting the value of our a&e liabilities, which include provisions for both reported and ibnr claims. there are many complex variables that we consider when estimating the reserves for our inventory of asbestos accounts and these variables may directly impact the predicted outcome. we believe the most significant variables relating to our a&e liabilities include the current legal environment; specific settlements that may be used as precedents to settle future claims; assumptions regarding trends with respect to claim severity and the frequency of higher severity claims; assumptions regarding the ability to allocate liability among defendants (including bankruptcy trusts) and other insurers; the ability of a claimant to bring a claim in a state in which they have no residency or exposure; the ability of a policyholder to claim the right to unaggregated coverage; whether high-level excess policies have the potential to be accessed given the policyholder's claim trends and liability situation; payments to unimpaired claimants; and, the potential liability of peripheral defendants. based on the policies, the facts, the law, and a careful analysis of the impact that these factors will likely have on any given account, we estimate the potential liability for indemnity, policyholder defense costs, and coverage litigation expense. the results in asbestos cases announced by other carriers or defendants may well have little or no relevance to us because coverage exposures are highly dependent upon the specific facts of individual coverage and resolution status of disputes among carriers, policyholders, and claimants. for additional information refer to the \"asbestos and environmental (a&e)\" section and to note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. 46 future policy benefits reserves we issue contracts in our insurance - overseas general and life segments that are classified as long-duration. these contracts generally include accident and supplemental health products, term and whole life products, endowment products, and annuities. in accordance with gaap, we establish reserves for contracts determined to be long-duration based on approved actuarial methods that include assumptions related to expenses, mortality, morbidity, persistency, and investment yields with a factor for adverse deviation. these assumptions are \"locked in\" at the inception of the contract, meaning we use our original assumptions throughout the life of the policy and do not subsequently modify them unless we deem the reserves to be inadequate. the future policy benefits reserves balance is regularly evaluated for a premium deficiency. if experience is less favorable than assumptions, additional liabilities may be required, resulting in a charge to policyholder benefits and claims. valuation of value of business acquired (voba) and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and voba as part of the acquisition of businesses that sell long-duration contracts, such as life products, we established an intangible asset related to voba, which represented the fair value of the future profits of the in-force contracts. the valuation of voba at the time of acquisition is derived from similar assumptions to those used to establish the associated future policy benefits reserves. the most significant input in this calculation is the discount rate used to arrive at the present value of the net cash flows. we amortize deferred policy acquisition costs associated with long-duration contracts and voba (collectively policy acquisition costs) over the estimated life of the contracts, generally in proportion to premium revenue recognized based upon the same assumptions used in estimating the liability for future policy benefits. for non-traditional long-duration contracts, we amortize policy acquisition costs over the expected life of the contracts in proportion to estimates of expected gross profits. the estimated life is established at the inception of the contracts or upon acquisition and is based on current persistency assumptions. policy acquisition costs, which consist of commissions, premium taxes, and certain underwriting costs related directly to the successful acquisition of a new or renewal insurance contract, are reviewed to determine if they are recoverable from future income, including investment income. unrecoverable costs are expensed in the period identified. risk transfer in the ordinary course of business, we both purchase (or cede) and sell (or assume) reinsurance protection. we discontinued the purchase of all finite risk reinsurance contracts, as a matter of policy, in 2002. for both ceded and assumed reinsurance, risk transfer requirements must be met in order to use reinsurance accounting, principally resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract as premiums and losses. if risk transfer requirements are not met, a contract is to be accounted for as a deposit, typically resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract through a deposit asset or liability and not as revenue or expense. to meet risk transfer requirements, a reinsurance contract must include both insurance risk, consisting of underwriting and timing risk, and a reasonable possibility of a significant loss for the assuming entity. we also apply similar risk transfer requirements to determine whether certain commercial insurance contracts should be accounted for as insurance or a deposit. contracts that include fixed premium (i.e., premium not subject to adjustment based on loss experience under the contract) for fixed coverage generally transfer risk and do not require judgment. reinsurance and insurance contracts that include both significant risk sharing provisions, such as adjustments to premiums or loss coverage based on loss experience, and relatively low policy limits, as evidenced by a high proportion of maximum premium assessments to loss limits, can require considerable judgment to determine whether or not risk transfer requirements are met. for such contracts, often referred to as finite or structured products, we require that risk transfer be specifically assessed for each contract by developing expected cash flow analyses at contract inception. to support risk transfer, the cash flow analyses must demonstrate that a significant loss is reasonably possible, such as a scenario in which the ratio of the net present value of losses divided by the net present value of premiums equals or exceeds 110 percent. for purposes of cash flow analyses, we generally use a risk-free rate of return consistent with the expected average duration of loss payments. in addition, to support insurance risk, we must prove the reinsurer's risk of loss varies with that of the reinsured and/or support various scenarios under which the assuming entity can recognize a significant loss. to ensure risk transfer requirements are routinely assessed, qualitative and quantitative risk transfer analyses and memoranda supporting risk transfer are developed by underwriters for all structured products. we have established protocols for structured products that include criteria triggering an accounting review of the contract prior to quoting. if any criterion is triggered, a contract must be reviewed by a committee established by each of our segments with reporting oversight, including peer review, from our global structured transaction review committee. with respect to ceded reinsurance, we entered into a few multi-year excess of loss retrospectively-rated contracts, principally in 2002. these contracts primarily provided severity protection for specific product divisions. because traditional one-year reinsurance coverage had become relatively costly, these contracts were generally entered in order to secure a more cost- 47 effective reinsurance program. all of these contracts transferred risk and were accounted for as reinsurance. in addition, we maintain a few aggregate excess of loss reinsurance contracts that were principally entered into prior to 2003, such as the national indemnity company (nico) contracts referred to in the section entitled, \"asbestos and environmental (a&e)\". we have not purchased any other retroactive ceded reinsurance contracts since 1999. with respect to assumed reinsurance and insurance contracts, products giving rise to judgments regarding risk transfer were primarily sold by our financial solutions business. although we have significantly curtailed writing financial solutions business, several contracts remain in-force and principally include multi-year retrospectively-rated contracts and loss portfolio transfers. because transfer of insurance risk is generally a primary client motivation for purchasing these products, relatively few insurance and reinsurance contracts have historically been written for which we concluded that risk transfer criteria had not been met. for certain insurance contracts that have been reported as deposits, the insured desired to self-insure a risk but was required, legally or otherwise, to purchase insurance so that claimants would be protected by a licensed insurance company in the event of non-payment from the insured. reinsurance recoverable reinsurance recoverable includes balances due to us from reinsurance companies for paid and unpaid losses and loss expenses and is presented net of a provision for uncollectible reinsurance. the provision for uncollectible reinsurance is determined based upon a review of the financial condition of the reinsurers and other factors. ceded reinsurance contracts do not relieve our primary obligation to our policyholders. consequently, an exposure exists with respect to reinsurance recoverable to the extent that any reinsurer is unable or unwilling to meet its obligations or disputes the liabilities assumed under the reinsurance contracts. we determine the reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses using actuarial estimates as well as a determination of our ability to cede unpaid losses and loss expenses under existing reinsurance contracts. the recognition of a reinsurance recoverable asset requires two key judgments. the first judgment involves our estimation based on the amount of gross reserves and the percentage of that amount which may be ceded to reinsurers. ceded ibnr, which is a major component of the reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses, is generally developed as part of our loss reserving process and, consequently, its estimation is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as the estimation of gross ibnr (refer to \"critical accounting estimates - unpaid losses and loss expenses\"). the second judgment involves our estimate of the amount of the reinsurance recoverable balance that we may ultimately be unable to recover from reinsurers due to insolvency, contractual dispute, or for other reasons. estimated uncollectible amounts are reflected in a provision that reduces the reinsurance recoverable asset and, in turn, shareholders' equity. changes in the provision for uncollectible reinsurance are reflected in net income. although the obligation of individual reinsurers to pay their reinsurance obligations is based on specific contract provisions, the collectability of such amounts requires estimation by management. the majority of the recoverable balance will not be due for collection until sometime in the future, and the duration of our recoverables may be longer than the duration of our direct exposures. over this period of time, economic conditions and operational performance of a particular reinsurer may impact their ability to meet these obligations and while they may continue to acknowledge their contractual obligation to do so, they may not have the financial resources or willingness to fully meet their obligation to us. to estimate the provision for uncollectible reinsurance, the reinsurance recoverable must first be determined for each reinsurer. this determination is based on a process rather than an estimate, although an element of judgment must be applied. as part of the process, ceded ibnr is allocated to reinsurance contracts because ceded ibnr is not generally calculated on a contract by contract basis. the allocations are generally based on premiums ceded under reinsurance contracts, adjusted for actual loss experience and historical relationships between gross and ceded losses. if actual premium and loss experience vary materially from historical experience, the allocation of reinsurance recoverable by reinsurer will be reviewed and may change. while such change is unlikely to result in a large percentage change in the provision for uncollectible reinsurance, it could, nevertheless, have a material effect on our net income in the period recorded. generally, we use a default analysis to estimate uncollectible reinsurance. the primary components of the default analysis are reinsurance recoverable balances by reinsurer, net of collateral, and default factors used to estimate the probability that the reinsurer may be unable to meet its future obligations in full. the definition of collateral for this purpose requires some judgment and is generally limited to assets held in an ace-only beneficiary trust, letters of credit, and liabilities held by us with the same legal entity for which we believe there is a right of offset. we do not currently include multi-beneficiary trusts. however, we have several reinsurers that have established multi-beneficiary trusts for which certain of our companies are beneficiaries. the determination of the default factor is principally based on the financial strength rating of the reinsurer and a corresponding default factor applicable to the financial strength rating. default factors require considerable judgment and are 48 determined using the current financial strength rating, or rating equivalent, of each reinsurer as well as other key considerations and assumptions. significant considerations and assumptions include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: • for reinsurers that maintain a financial strength rating from a major rating agency, and for which recoverable balances are considered representative of the larger population (i.e., default probabilities are consistent with similarly rated reinsurers and payment durations conform to averages), the judgment exercised by management to determine the provision for uncollectible reinsurance of each reinsurer is typically limited because the financial rating is based on a published source and the default factor we apply is based on a historical default factor of a major rating agency applicable to the particular rating class. default factors applied for financial ratings of aaa, aa, a, bbb, bb, b, and ccc, are 0.8 percent, 1.2 percent, 1.7 percent, 4.9 percent, 19.6 percent, 34.0 percent, and 62.2 percent, respectively. because our model is predicated on the historical default factors of a major rating agency, we do not generally consider alternative factors. however, when a recoverable is expected to be paid in a brief period of time by a highly-rated reinsurer, such as certain property catastrophe claims, a default factor may not be applied; • for balances recoverable from reinsurers that are both unrated by a major rating agency and for which management is unable to determine a credible rating equivalent based on a parent or affiliated company, we may determine a rating equivalent based on our analysis of the reinsurer that considers an assessment of the creditworthiness of the particular entity, industry benchmarks, or other factors as considered appropriate. we then apply the applicable default factor for that rating class. for balances recoverable from unrated reinsurers for which our ceded reserve is below a certain threshold, we generally apply a default factor of 34.0 percent; • for balances recoverable from reinsurers that are either insolvent or under regulatory supervision, we establish a default factor and resulting provision for uncollectible reinsurance based on specific facts and circumstances surrounding each company. upon initial notification of an insolvency, we generally recognize expense for a substantial portion of all balances outstanding, net of collateral, through a combination of write-offs of recoverable balances and increases to the provision for uncollectible reinsurance. when regulatory action is taken on a reinsurer, we generally recognize a default factor by estimating an expected recovery on all balances outstanding, net of collateral. when sufficient credible information becomes available, we adjust the provision for uncollectible reinsurance by establishing a default factor pursuant to information received; and • for captives and other recoverables, management determines the provision for uncollectible reinsurance based on the specific facts and circumstances. the following table summarizes reinsurance recoverables and the provision for uncollectible reinsurance for each type of recoverable balance at december 31, 2014: gross reinsurance recoverables on losses and loss expenses recoverables (net of usable collateral) provision for uncollectible reinsurance (in millions of u.s. dollars) type reinsurers with credit ratings $9,169 $8,390 $202 reinsurers not rated 186 146 50 reinsurers under supervision and insolvent reinsurers 98 97 54 captives 1,986 366 23 other - structured settlements and pools 910 904 28 total $12,349 $9,903 $357 at december 31, 2014, the use of different assumptions within our approach could have a material effect on the provision for uncollectible reinsurance. to the extent the creditworthiness of our reinsurers were to deteriorate due to an adverse event affecting the reinsurance industry, such as a large number of major catastrophes, actual uncollectible amounts could be significantly greater than our provision for uncollectible reinsurance. such an event could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and our liquidity. given the various considerations used to estimate our uncollectible provision, we cannot precisely quantify the effect a specific industry event may have on the provision for uncollectible reinsurance. however, based on the composition (particularly the average credit quality) of the reinsurance recoverable balance at december 31, 2014, we estimate that a ratings downgrade of one notch for all rated reinsurers (i.e., from a to a- or a- to bbb+) could increase our provision for uncollectible reinsurance by approximately $73 million or approximately 0.6 percent of the gross reinsurance recoverable balance, assuming no other changes relevant to the calculation. while a ratings downgrade would result in an increase in our provision for uncollectible reinsurance and a charge to earnings in that period, a downgrade in 49 and of itself does not imply that we will be unable to collect all of the ceded reinsurance recoverable from the reinsurers in question. refer to note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. other-than-temporary impairments (otti) each quarter, we review securities in an unrealized loss position (impaired securities), including fixed maturities, securities lending collateral, equity securities, and other investments, to identify impaired securities to be specifically evaluated for a potential otti. because our investment portfolio is the largest component of consolidated assets and a multiple of shareholders' equity, otti could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. refer to note 3 d) to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the otti process. deferred tax assets many of our insurance businesses operate in income tax-paying jurisdictions. our deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily result from temporary differences between the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities. we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities separately for each tax-paying component (an individual entity or group of entities that is consolidated for tax purposes) in each tax jurisdiction. the realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods under the tax law in the applicable tax jurisdiction. at december 31, 2014, our net deferred tax asset was $295 million. refer to note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. at each balance sheet date, management assesses the need to establish a valuation allowance that reduces deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all, or some portion, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. the valuation allowance is based on all available information including projections of future taxable income from each tax-paying component in each tax jurisdiction, principally derived from business plans and available tax planning strategies. projections of future taxable income incorporate several assumptions of future business and operations that are apt to differ from actual experience. the valuation allowance is also based on maintaining our ability and intent to hold our u.s. available for sale fixed maturities to recovery. if our assumptions and estimates that resulted in our forecast of future taxable income for each tax-paying component prove to be incorrect, or future market events occur that prevent our ability to hold our u.s. fixed maturities to recovery, an additional valuation allowance could become necessary, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. at december 31, 2014, the valuation allowance of $17 million reflects management's assessment that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized due to the inability of certain foreign subsidiaries to generate sufficient taxable income. fair value measurements accounting guidance defines fair value as the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy based on the reliability of the inputs. the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets (level 1 inputs) and the lowest priority to unobservable data (level 3 inputs): • level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. • level 2 includes inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for assets or liabilities either directly or indirectly. level 2 inputs include, among other items, quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as interest rates and yield curves. • level 3 inputs are unobservable and reflect our judgments about assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. we categorize financial instruments within the valuation hierarchy at the balance sheet date based upon the lowest level of inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement. accordingly, transfers between levels within the valuation hierarchy occur when there are significant changes to the inputs, such as increases or decreases in market activity, changes to the availability of current prices, changes to the transparency to underlying inputs, and whether there are significant variances in quoted prices. transfers in and/or out of any level are assumed to occur at the end of the period. while we obtain values for the majority of our investment securities from pricing services, it is ultimately our responsibility to determine whether the values obtained in the financial statements are representative of fair value. we periodically update our understanding of the methodologies used by our pricing services in order to validate that the prices obtained from those services 50 are consistent with the gaap definition of fair value as an exit price. based on our understanding of the methodologies, our pricing services only produce an estimate of fair value if there is observable market information that would allow them to make a fair value estimate. based on our understanding of the market inputs used by our pricing services, all applicable investments have been valued in accordance with gaap valuation principles. we have controls to review significant price changes and stale pricing, and to ensure that prices received from pricing services have been accurately reflected in the consolidated financial statements. we do not adjust prices obtained from pricing services. additionally, fixed maturities valuation is more subjective when markets are less liquid due to the lack of market based inputs (i.e., stale pricing), which may increase the potential that an investment's estimated fair value is not reflective of the price at which an actual transaction would occur. for a small number of fixed maturities, we obtain a quote from a broker (typically a market maker). due to the disclaimers on the quotes that indicate that the price is indicative only, we include these fair value estimates in level 3. at december 31, 2014 and 2013, level 3 assets represented five percent of assets measured at fair value and three percent of total assets. level 3 liabilities represented 88 percent and 74 percent of liabilities measured at fair value at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and less than one percent of our total liabilities at both december 31, 2014 and 2013. refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the valuation techniques and inputs used to determine fair values for our financial instruments measured or disclosed at fair value by valuation hierarchy (levels 1, 2, and 3) as well as a roll-forward of level 3 financial instruments measured at fair value for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012. assumed reinsurance programs involving minimum benefit guarantees under variable annuity contracts ace reinsures various death and living benefit guarantees associated with variable annuities issued primarily in the united states and japan. we ceased writing this business in 2007. guarantees which are payable on death are referred to as guaranteed minimum death benefits (gmdb). guarantees on living benefits (glb) includes guaranteed minimum income benefits (gmib) and guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits (gmab). for further description of this product and related accounting treatment, refer to note 1 j) to the consolidated financial statements. guaranteed living benefits (glb) derivatives our glb reinsurance is classified as a derivative for accounting purposes and therefore carried at fair value. we believe that the most meaningful presentation of these glb derivatives is as follows: • estimates of the average modeled value of future cash outflows is recorded as incurred losses (i.e., benefit reserves). cash inflows or revenue are reported as net premiums earned and changes in the benefit reserves are reflected as policy benefits expense in the consolidated statement of operations, which is included in underwriting income. • the incremental difference between the fair value of glb reinsurance contracts and benefit reserves is reflected in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and related changes in fair value are reflected in net realized gains (losses) in the consolidated statement of operations. determination of glb fair value the fair value of glb reinsurance is estimated using an internal valuation model, which includes current market information and estimates of policyholder behavior from the perspective of a theoretical market participant that would assume these liabilities. all of our treaties contain claim limits, which are factored into the valuation model. the fair value depends on a number of factors, including interest rates, equity markets, credit risk, current account value, market volatility, expected annuitization rates and other policyholder behavior, and changes in policyholder mortality. the model and related assumptions are regularly re-evaluated by management and enhanced, as appropriate, based upon additional experience obtained related to policyholder behavior and availability of more timely market information. due to the inherent uncertainties of the assumptions used in the valuation models to determine the fair value of these derivative products, actual experience may differ materially from the estimates reflected in our consolidated financial statements. we intend to hold these derivative contracts to maturity (i.e., the expiration of the underlying liabilities through lapse, annuitization, death, or expiration of the reinsurance contract). to partially offset the risk of changes in the fair value of glb reinsurance contracts, we invest in derivative hedge instruments. at maturity, the cumulative realized gains and losses (excluding cumulative hedge gains or losses) from fair value changes of glb reinsurance contracts will net to zero because, over time, the insurance liability will be increased or decreased to equal our obligation. 51 determination of glb and guaranteed minimum death benefits (gmdb) benefit reserves management established benefit reserves based on a long-term benefit ratio (or loss ratio) calculated using assumptions reflecting management's best estimate of the future short-term and long-term performance of the variable annuity line of business. despite the long-term nature of the risk, the benefit ratio calculation is impacted by short-term market movements that may be judged by management to be transient. management regularly examines both qualitative and quantitative analysis, including a review of the differential between the benefit ratio used at the most recent valuation date and the benefit ratio calculated on subsequent dates. management regularly evaluates its estimates and uses judgment to determine the extent to which assumptions underlying the benefit ratio calculation should be adjusted. for the year ended december 31, 2014, management determined that no change to the benefit ratio was warranted. for further information on the estimates and assumptions used in determining the fair value of glb reinsurance, refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. for a sensitivity discussion of the effect of changes in interest rates, equity indices, and other assumptions on the fair value of glbs, and the resulting impact on our net income, refer to item 7a. risk management we employ a strategy to manage the financial market and policyholder behavior risks embedded in the reinsurance of variable annuity (va) guarantees. risk management begins with underwriting a prospective client and guarantee design, with particular focus on protecting our position from policyholder options that, because of anti-selective behavior, could adversely impact our obligation. a second layer of risk management is the structure of the reinsurance contracts. all va guarantee reinsurance contracts include some form of annual or aggregate claim limit(s). for example, for 60 percent of the gmdb portfolio (based on guaranteed value), there is an annual claim limit of 2 percent of account value. the different categories of claim limits are as follows: reinsurance program covering % of total guaranteed value (gv) % of gv that has additional reinsurance coverage additional terms gmdb with an annual claim limit of 2% of account value (av) 60% of total gmdb 2% for glb n/a gmdb with claim limit(s) that are a function of underlying gv (varies from 0.4% to 2.0% of gv) 30% of total gmdb 80% for glb l 60% of gv subject to annual claim deductibles(1) of 0.1% to 0.2% of gvl 45% of gv subject to an aggregate claim limit of approximately $384 million gmdb and gmab 10% of total glb n/a l programs are quota-share (qs) agreements with qs % decreasing as ratio of av to gv decreases: - qs 100% for ratios between 100% - 75% - qs 60% for ratios between 75% - 45% - qs 30% for ratios less than 45%l 35% of gv subject to a per policy claim deductible of 8.8% of gv for gmab only(1) 10% of total gmdb gmib

annuity deposits (1) ace would only pay total annual claims in excess of deductibles. 52 a third layer of risk management is the hedging strategy which looks to mitigate both long-term economic loss over time as well as dampen income statement volatility. we owned financial market instruments as part of the hedging strategy with a fair value liability of $19 million and $54 million at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the instruments are substantially collateralized by our counterparties, on a daily basis. we also limit the aggregate amount of variable annuity reinsurance guarantee risk we are willing to assume. the last substantive transactions were quoted in late 2007. the aggregate number of policyholders is currently decreasing through policyholder withdrawals, annuitizations, and deaths at a rate of 5 percent to 15 percent per annum. note that glb claims cannot occur for any reinsured policy until it has reached the end of its \"waiting period\". 48 percent of the policies we reinsure reached the end of their \"waiting periods\" in 2014 and prior, as shown in the table below. year of first payment eligibility percent of living benefitaccount values 2014

(rain and hail) acquired in 2010; • north american division of combined insurance acquired in 2008; • domestic and international divisions of ace ina acquired in 1999, including subsequent international acquisitions; and • ace tempest re's businesses acquired in 1996 and 1998. the impairment evaluation first uses a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not (i.e., more than a 50 percent probability) that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount. if a reporting unit fails this qualitative assessment, a quantitative analysis is then used. the quantitative analysis is a two-step process in which an initial assessment for potential impairment is performed and, if a potential impairment is present, the amount of impairment is measured and recorded. other reporting units from smaller acquisitions are also assessed annually. based on our impairment testing for 2014, we determined no impairment was required and none of our reporting units were at risk for impairment. in assessing the fair value of a reporting unit, we make assumptions and estimates about the profitability attributable to our reporting units, including: • short-term and long-term growth rates; and • estimated cost of equity and changes in long-term risk-free interest rates. if our assumptions and estimates made in assessing the fair value of acquired entities change, we could be required to write-down the carrying value of goodwill which could be material to our results of operations in the period the charge is taken. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ consolidated operating results -

overseas general segment on a constant-dollar basis from new business writings in our retail operations in all product lines - personal lines, a&h, and p&c and from the acquisitions of fianzas monterrey in april 2013, aba seguros in may 2013, samaggi in april 2014, and itaú seguros in october 2014. foreign exchange adversely impacted growth on an as reported basis. our insurance - north american p&c segment reported an increase in net premiums written from growth across a broad range of our product portfolio throughout our ace usa retail and our wholesale divisions, as well as in our commercial risk services and ace private risk services divisions, primarily reflecting strong renewal retention and new business. our life segment also reported an increase in net premiums written primarily due to growth in our asian markets. net premiums written decreased in our insurance - north american agriculture segment due to lower multiple peril crop insurance (mpci) revenues reflecting lower commodity prices, partially offset by higher premium retention as a result of the non-renewal of a third-party proportional reinsurance agreement. our global reinsurance segment also reported a decrease in net premiums written due to the non-renewal of a large workers' compensation treaty, partially offset by new business. net premiums written increased in 2013 due to higher net premiums written in our insurance - overseas general segment on a constant-dollar basis driven by strong performance in our retail operations in all product lines - p&c, a&h, and personal lines. the acquisitions of aba seguros and fianzas monterrey (mexican acquisitions), and jaya proteksi in september 2012 also added to premium growth. foreign exchange adversely impacted growth on an as reported basis. our insurance - north american p&c segment also reported increases in net premiums written in our ace usa retail division from growth across a broad range of our product portfolio reflecting rate increases, exposure changes, strong renewal retention, and new business. net written premiums decreased in our insurance - north american agriculture segment due to lower premium retention in our mpci program. net premiums earned for short-duration contracts, typically p&c contracts, generally reflect the portion of net premiums written that were recorded as revenues for the period as the exposure periods expire. net premiums earned for long-duration contracts, 55 typically traditional life contracts, generally are recognized as earned when due from policyholders. net premiums earned increased in 2014 in our insurance - overseas general, insurance - north american p&c, and life segments as described above. our global reinsurance segment also reported an increase in net premiums earned primarily from the shorter earning period on certain of the new business written this year including two non-recurring short-term treaties. net premiums earned decreased in our insurance - north american agriculture segment from lower net premiums written as described above. net premiums earned increased in 2013 in our insurance - overseas general segment driven by strong performance in all product lines and our acquisitions as described above. our insurance - north american p&c segment also reported increases in net premiums earned from higher net premiums written as described above. net premiums earned decreased in our insurance - north american agriculture and global reinsurance segments from lower net premiums written as described above. net investment income was $2.3 billion for 2014, $2.1 billion for 2013, and $2.2 billion for 2012. refer to \"net investment income\" and \"investments\" for additional information. in evaluating our segments excluding life, we use the combined ratio, the loss and loss expense ratio, the policy acquisition cost ratio, and the administrative expense ratio. we calculate these ratios by dividing the respective expense amounts by net premiums earned. we do not calculate these ratios for the life segment as we do not use these measures to monitor or manage that segment. the combined ratio is determined by adding the loss and loss expense ratio, the policy acquisition cost ratio, and the administrative expense ratio. a combined ratio under 100 percent indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio exceeding 100 percent indicates underwriting loss. the following table presents the components of gaap combined ratio as well as a reconciliation of gaap combined ratio to p&c combined ratio. the p&c combined ratio is a non-gaap financial measure and includes the impact of realized gains and losses on crop derivatives. these derivatives were purchased to provide economic benefit, in a manner similar to reinsurance protection, in the event that a significant decline in commodity pricing impacts underwriting results. we view gains and losses on these derivatives as part of the results of our underwriting operations. 2014 2013 2012 loss and loss expense ratio 58.7 % 59.6 % 65.7 % policy acquisition cost ratio 16.8 % 15.7 % 15.3 % administrative expense ratio 12.6 % 12.7 % 12.9 % gaap combined ratio 88.1 % 88.0 % 93.9 % gains on crop derivatives (0.4 )% -

north american agriculture segment's mpci business. the 2012 ratio was favorably impacted by higher premium retention and lower agent commissions in the mpci business caused by the drought conditions in the u.s. this increase was partially offset by a lower policy acquisition cost ratio in our insurance - overseas general segment primarily due to the relatively lower acquisition costs expensed by our new mexican operations. our administrative expense ratio decreased slightly in 2014 as growth in net premiums earned outpaced growth in administrative expenses, partially offset by the favorable impact of a $29 million prior year legal settlement. our administrative expense ratio decreased in 2013 primarily due to the favorable impact of the legal settlement in 2013 and growth in net premiums earned that outpaced the growth in administrative expenses in our insurance - north american p&c segment. this favorable impact was offset by a decrease in our insurance - north american agriculture segment's net premiums earned as well as the impact of lower administrative and operating expense (a&o) reimbursements in our mpci business. our effective income tax rate, which we calculate as income tax expense divided by income before income tax, is dependent upon the mix of earnings from different jurisdictions with various tax rates. a change in the geographic mix of earnings would change the effective income tax rate. our effective income tax rate was 18.2 percent in 2014, compared with 11.3 percent and 9.1 percent in 2013 and 2012, respectively. the effective income tax rate in 2014 is higher compared to 2013 primarily due to both net realized losses and a lower percentage of operating earnings being generated in lower tax paying jurisdictions as well as a $115 million change to deferred tax assets that resulted from the decline in the book value of certain foreign subsidiaries, related to unrealized foreign exchange losses. the increase in our effective income tax rate in 2013 compared to 2012 was due to the favorable resolution of various prior years' tax matters and the closing of statutes of limitations of $124 million during 2012. partially offsetting the increase in the 2013 effective tax rate was the impact of both net realized gains on derivatives and a higher percentage of earnings being generated in lower tax paying jurisdictions during 2013. the lower tax rates attributed to our foreign operations primarily reflects lower corporate tax rates that prevail outside of the u.s. during 2014, approximately 66 percent of our total pre-tax income was tax effected based on these lower rates. the significant jurisdictions outside of the u.s. include the u.k., switzerland, and bermuda with effective federal income tax rates in those countries of 21.5 percent, 7.83 percent, and 0.0 percent, respectively. 57 _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ prior period development years ended december 31(in millions of u.s. dollars, except for percentages) long-tail short-tail total % of net unpaidreserves (1) 2014 insurance -

personal lines, a&h, and p&c. the increase in personal lines reflected growth in all regions, and a&h growth 62 was driven by strong results in all regions except europe. p&c growth was driven primarily by new business writings in asia and latin america. in addition, the acquisitions of fianzas monterrey in april 2013, aba seguros in may 2013, samaggi in april 2014, and itaú seguros in october 2014 added $310 million of growth to premiums. foreign exchange adversely impacted growth for 2014 on an as reported basis. net premiums written increased in 2013 on a constant-dollar basis driven by strong performance in our retail operations and from acquisitions. growth was reported in our retail operations in all product lines - p&c, a&h, and personal lines. p&c growth was reported across all regions of our retail operations, driven by strong renewal retention and improved new business writings. a&h growth was primarily driven by strong results in asia and latin america. personal lines growth reflected new business opportunities in europe, latin america, and asia. in addition, the acquisitions of aba seguros, fianzas monterrey, and jaya proteksi in september 2012, added $407 million of growth to premiums. foreign exchange adversely impacted growth for 2013 on an as reported basis. net premiums earned increased in 2014 and 2013 primarily due to the increase in net premiums written as described above. insurance -

million in 2013 and $76 million in 2012. catastrophe losses in 2014 were primarily related to flooding in europe, severe storms in japan, a hurricane in mexico, and a hailstorm in australia. catastrophe losses in 2013 were primarily related to flooding in australia, europe, and canada, as well as hurricanes in latin america, and an earthquake in new zealand. catastrophe losses in 2012 were primarily from superstorm sandy, hurricane isaac, and flooding in the u.k. net favorable prior period development was $391 million in 2014, compared with $299 million in 2013 and $226 million in 2012. refer to the \"prior period development\" section for additional information. the adjusted loss ratio decreased in 2014 due primarily to both mix of business and underwriting actions which improved loss ratios on several portfolios. the adjusted loss ratio decreased in 2013 due primarily to large property losses in 2012 which unfavorably impacted the 2012 ratio. the policy acquisition ratio increased in 2014 due primarily to the normal impact of initial year purchase accounting adjustments related to our mexican acquisitions which favorably impacted the 2013 policy acquisition cost ratio by 0.6 points. as a result of purchase accounting requirements, the unearned premiums at the date of purchase related to the businesses acquired are recognized over the remaining coverage period with no expense for the associated historical acquisition costs that were incurred to underwrite those policies. in addition, the policy acquisition cost ratio increased due to a change in the overall mix of business towards a&h and personal lines products in regions that have higher acquisition cost ratios. the policy acquisition ratio decreased in 2013 primarily due to the relatively lower acquisition costs expensed by our new mexican operations. the administrative expense ratio decreased in 2014 due primarily to growth in net premiums earned that outpaced the growth in administrative expenses. in addition, the administrative expense ratio decreased due to increased spending in the prior year to support growth. the administrative expense ratio decreased in 2013 due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange, the mexican acquisitions described above, which generate lower administrative expenses than our other businesses, as well as growth in net premiums earned that outpaced the growth in administrative expenses and lower a&h regulatory fees paid in europe. 64 global reinsurance the global reinsurance segment represents our reinsurance operations comprising ace tempest re bermuda, ace tempest re usa, ace tempest re international, and ace tempest re canada. global reinsurance markets its reinsurance products worldwide under the ace tempest re brand name and provides a

property catastrophe cessions to a sidecar, altair re, and lower catastrophe reinstatement premiums. this decrease was substantially offset by strong renewal retention and new business written, primarily in our u.s. property and u.s. automobile lines of business. net premiums earned increased in 2014 primarily from the shorter earning period on certain of the new business written this year including two non-recurring short-term treaties. net premiums earned decreased in 2013 due to a non-recurring lpt treaty written in 2012, which was fully earned when written and, to a lesser extent, the higher property catastrophe cessions noted above. this decrease was partially offset by higher net premiums earned in our u.s. property lines due to higher premiums written in 2013 and prior years. 65 the following tables present a line of business breakdown of global reinsurance net premiums earned: % change (in millions of u.s. dollars, except for percentages) 2014 2013 2012 2014 vs.

catastrophe losses in 2012 were primarily from superstorm sandy, hurricane isaac, and other north american weather-related events. net favorable prior period development was $63 million in 2014, compared with $84 million in 2013 and $61 million in 2012 (2014, 2013 and 2012 are net of $10 million, $8 million, and $4 million, respectively, of unfavorable premium adjustments to loss sensitive treaties). refer to the \"prior period development\" section for additional information. the adjusted loss and loss expense ratio decreased slightly in 2014 and decreased in 2013 primarily due to the lpt treaty written in 2012, which unfavorably impacted the 2012 ratio. the policy acquisition cost ratio increased in 2014 primarily due to a change in the mix of business towards products written in the u.s. that have a higher acquisition cost ratio than in other regions and the impact of the non-renewal of a large workers' compensation treaty which incurred no acquisition costs. the policy acquisition cost ratio increased in 2013 due to a change in the mix of business towards products that have a higher acquisition cost ratio as well as the lpt treaty written in 2012, which did not generate acquisition costs. the administrative expense ratio increased in 2014 as the prior year included the favorable impact of a $2 million expense adjustment that reduced the administrative expense ratio in 2013. excluding this adjustment, the administrative expense ratio remained flat. the administrative expense ratio remained relatively flat in 2013. 66 life the life segment includes

remained flat in 2014 after adjusting for the $16 million unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. a&h net premiums written increased slightly in 2013 with improved new business production and a catch-up in premium registrations. life insurance net premiums written increased in 2014 and 2013 primarily due to growth in our asian markets. life reinsurance net premiums written decreased in 2014 and 2013 because there is no new life reinsurance business currently being written. deposits collected on universal life and investment contracts (life deposits) are not reflected as revenues in our consolidated statements of operations in accordance with gaap. new life deposits are an important component of production and key to our efforts to grow our business. although life deposits do not significantly affect current period income from operations, they are an important indicator of growth. the increase in life deposits collected in 2014 and 2013 is primarily due to growth in our asian markets. 67 in 2014, we determined that certain a&h marketing-related costs were more appropriately classified as acquisition costs. this resulted in a $59 million increase to acquisition expenses and an offsetting decrease to administrative expenses in 2014. net realized gains (losses), which are excluded from life underwriting income, relate primarily to the change in the net fair value of reported guaranteed living benefits (glb) reinsurance liabilities and changes in the fair value of derivatives used to partially offset the risk in the variable annuity guarantee portfolio. during 2014, realized losses of $213 million were associated with a net increase in the value of glb liabilities; this increase was primarily due to lower interest rates and the unfavorable impact of discounting future claims for one less year, partially offset by a weakening yen and rising u.s. equity levels. in the fourth quarter of 2014, we completed an updated in-depth review of actual policyholder lapse and annuitization behavior by treaty for our variable annuity reinsurance business. as a result of our review, we made several refinements to our lapse assumptions, the most significant of which was an increase in lapses for most large, in-the-money, guaranteed minimum income benefits (gmib) policies beyond the surrender charge period. the increase in lapse assumptions decreased the fair value of glb liabilities and generated a realized gain of $31 million. because of a greater degree of reported experience related to behavior in years subsequent to the first year of annuitization eligibility, we also made several adjustments to our annuitization assumptions, which generally lowered the annuitization rate for most clients, while raising it for two clients. the change in annuitization assumptions decreased the fair value of glb liabilities and generated a realized gain of $39 million. we will continue to monitor actual policyholder behavior against our assumptions and make adjustments as appropriate. also, during the fourth quarter of 2014, we increased the granularity of policy groupings used in our valuation model. this refinement increased the fair value of glb liabilities and generated a realized loss of $78 million. during 2013, realized gains of $929 million were associated with a net decrease in the value of glb liabilities; this decrease was primarily due to rising equity levels, higher interest rates, and a weakening yen, partially offset by a net unfavorable impact of changes in lapse and annuitization assumptions and the unfavorable impact of discounting future claims for one less year. during 2012, realized gains of $203 million were associated with a net decrease in the value of glb liabilities; this decrease was primarily due to rising equity levels and a weakening yen, partially offset by an increased value of glb liabilities due to falling interest rates and the unfavorable impact of discounting future claims for one less year. in addition, we experienced realized losses of $168 million, $579 million, and $297 million in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively, due to a decrease in the value of derivative instruments, which decrease in value when the s&p 500 index increases. 68

(119 ) net investment income $2,252 $2,144 $2,181 net investment income is influenced by a number of factors including the amounts and timing of inward and outward cash flows, the level of interest rates, and changes in overall asset allocation. net investment income increased 5.1 percent in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to a higher overall invested asset base and call activity in our corporate bond portfolio, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange. net investment income decreased 1.7 percent in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to lower reinvestment rates in our fixed income portfolio, offset by a higher overall invested asset base. the investment portfolio's average market yield on fixed maturities was 2.8 percent, 3.0 percent, and 2.3 percent at december 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. average market yield on fixed maturities represents the weighted average yield to maturity of our fixed income portfolio based on the market prices of the holdings at that date. the 1.9 percent yield on short-term investments for the year ended december 31, 2014 reflects the global nature of our insurance operations. for example, yields on short-term investments in brazil, indonesia, ecuador, and malaysia range from 3.3 percent to 11.8 percent. the 4.9 percent yield on our equity securities portfolio for the year ended december 31, 2014 is high relative to the yield on the s&p 500 index because of dividends on preferred equity securities and because we classified our strategic emerging debt portfolio, which is a mutual fund, as equity. during the third quarter of 2014, however, we elected to exchange our interest in the strategic emerging debt portfolio for direct ownership of certain of the underlying fixed maturities, and the remainder in cash. in 2014, the strategic emerging debt portfolio, prior to the election to exchange our interest, and the preferred equity securities represented 64 percent of the gross equity securities investment income. the following table shows the return on average invested assets: years ended december 31 (in millions of u.s. dollars, except for percentages) 2014 2013 2012 average

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ net realized and unrealized gains (losses) we take a long-term view with our investment strategy, and our investment managers manage our investment portfolio to maximize total return within certain specific guidelines designed to minimize risk. the majority of our investment portfolio is available for sale and reported at fair value. our held to maturity investment portfolio is reported at amortized cost. the effect of market movements on our available for sale investment portfolio impacts net income (through net realized gains (losses)) when securities are sold or when we record an other-than-temporary impairment (otti) charge in net income. for a discussion related to how we assess otti for all of our investments, including credit-related otti, and the related impact on net income, refer to note 3 d) to the consolidated financial statements. additionally, net income is impacted through the reporting of changes in the fair value of derivatives, including financial futures, options, swaps, and glb reinsurance. changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation on available for sale securities, which result from the revaluation of securities held, are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity in the consolidated balance sheets. the following table presents our pre-tax net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investments: year ended december 31, 2014 year ended december 31, 2013

public equity. for the year ended december 31, 2013, other-than-temporary impairments include $18 million for fixed maturities, $2 million for private equity, and $2 million for public equity. at december 31, 2014, our investment portfolios held by u.s. legal entities included approximately $37 million of gross unrealized losses on fixed income investments. our tax planning strategy related to these losses is based on our view that we will hold these fixed income investments until they recover their cost. as such, we have recognized a deferred tax asset of approximately $13 million related to these fixed income investments. this strategy allows us to recognize the associated deferred tax asset related to these fixed income investments as we do not believe these losses will ever be realized. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ other income and expense items other (income) expense was $(82) million in 2014 compared with $15 million and $(6) million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. refer to note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for the components of other (income) expense. 70 _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ investments our investment portfolio is invested primarily in publicly traded, investment grade, fixed income securities with an average credit quality of a/aa as rated by the independent investment rating services standard and poor's (s&p)/ moody's investors service (moody's). the portfolio is externally managed by independent, professional investment managers and is broadly diversified across geographies, sectors, and issuers. other investments principally comprise direct investments, investment funds, and limited partnerships. we hold no collateralized debt obligations or collateralized loan obligations in our investment portfolio, and we provide no credit default protection. we have long-standing global credit limits for our entire portfolio across the organization. exposures are aggregated, monitored, and actively managed by our global credit committee, comprising senior executives, including our chief financial officer, our chief risk officer, our chief investment officer, and our treasurer. we also have well-established, strict contractual investment rules requiring managers to maintain highly diversified exposures to individual issuers and closely monitor investment manager compliance with portfolio guidelines. the average duration of our fixed income securities, including the effect of options and swaps, was 4.0 years at both december 31, 2014 and 2013. we estimate that a 100 basis point (bps) increase in interest rates would reduce the valuation of our fixed income portfolio by approximately $2.4 billion at december 31, 2014. the following table shows the fair value and cost/amortized cost of our invested assets: december

investments $63,162 $60,918 $61,093 $59,779 the fair value of our total investments increased $2.1 billion during the year ended december 31, 2014, primarily due to the investing of operating cash flows and unrealized appreciation, partially offset by share repurchases, and the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange. during the third quarter of 2014, we decided to transfer securities, considered essential holdings in a diversified portfolio, with a total fair value of $2.0 billion from fixed maturities available for sale to fixed maturities held to maturity. these securities, which we have the intent and ability to hold to maturity, were transferred given the growth in ace's investment portfolio over the last several years, as well as continued efforts to manage the diversification of our global portfolio. 71 the following tables present the market value of our fixed maturities and short-term investments at december 31, 2014 and 2013. the first table lists

municipal as part of our overall investment strategy, we may invest in states, municipalities, and other political subdivisions fixed maturity securities (municipal). we apply the same investment selection process described previously to our municipal investments. the portfolio is highly diversified primarily in state general obligation bonds and essential service revenue bonds including education and utilities (water, power, and sewers). non-u.s. our exposure to the euro results primarily from ace european group which is headquartered in london and offers a broad range of coverages throughout the european union, central, and eastern europe. ace primarily invests in euro denominated investments to support its local currency insurance obligations and required capital levels. ace's local currency investment portfolios have strict contractual investment guidelines requiring managers to maintain a high quality and diversified portfolio to both sector and individual issuers. investment portfolios are monitored daily to ensure investment manager compliance with portfolio guidelines. our non-u.s. investment grade fixed income portfolios are currency-matched with the insurance liabilities of our non-u.s. operations. the average credit quality of our non-u.s. fixed income securities is a and 54 percent of our holdings are rated aaa or guaranteed by governments or quasi-government agencies. within the context of these investment portfolios, our government and corporate bond holdings are highly diversified across industries and geographies. issuer limits are based on credit rating (aa-two percent, a-one percent, bbb-0.5 percent of the total portfolio) and are monitored daily via an internal compliance system. because of this investment approach we do not have a direct exposure to troubled sovereign borrowers in europe. we manage our indirect exposure using the same credit rating based investment approach. accordingly, we do not believe our indirect exposure is material. the following table summarizes the market value and amortized cost of our non-u.s. fixed income portfolio by country/sovereign for non-u.s. government securities at december 31,

are listed in the non-u.s. corporate fixed income portfolio above represent the ultimate parent company's country of risk. non-u.s. corporate securities could be issued by foreign subsidiaries of u.s. corporations. below-investment grade corporate fixed income portfolio below-investment grade securities have different characteristics than investment grade corporate debt securities. risk of loss from default by the borrower is greater with below-investment grade securities. below-investment grade securities are generally unsecured and are often subordinated to other creditors of the issuer. also, issuers of below-investment grade securities usually have higher levels of debt and are more sensitive to adverse economic conditions, such as recession or increasing interest rates, than investment grade issuers. at december 31, 2014, our corporate fixed income investment portfolio included below-investment grade and non-rated securities which, in total, comprised approximately 13 percent of our fixed income portfolio. our below-investment grade and non-rated portfolio includes over 1,200 issuers, with the greatest single exposure being $96 million. we manage high-yield bonds as a distinct and separate asset class from investment grade bonds. the allocation to high-yield bonds is explicitly set by internal management and is targeted to securities in the upper tier of credit quality (bb/b). our minimum rating for initial purchase is bb/b. six external investment managers are responsible for high-yield security selection and portfolio construction. our high-yield managers have a conservative approach to credit selection and very low historical default experience. holdings are highly diversified across industries and subject to a 1.5 percent issuer limit as a percentage of high-yield allocation. we monitor position limits daily through an internal compliance system. derivative and structured securities (e.g., credit default swaps and collateralized loan obligations) are not permitted in the high-yield portfolio. 74 ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ reinsurance

uncollectible reinsurance. we evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and potential reinsurers on a regular basis and also monitor concentrations of credit risk with reinsurers. the provision for uncollectible reinsurance is required principally due to the potential failure of reinsurers to indemnify us, primarily because of disputes under reinsurance contracts and insolvencies. the provision for uncollectible reinsurance is based on a default analysis applied to gross reinsurance recoverables, net of approximately $2.4 billion and $2.3 billion of collateral at december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the increase in net reinsurance recoverable on loss and loss expenses was primarily due to the acquisition of itaú seguros, which added $1.1 billion, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ asbestos and environmental (a&e) asbestos and environmental (a&e) reserving considerations for asbestos, ace faces claims relating to policies issued to manufacturers, distributors, installers, and other parties in the chain of commerce for asbestos and products containing asbestos. claims can be filed by individual claimants or groups of claimants with the potential for hundreds of individual claimants at one time. claimants will generally allege damages across an extended time period which may coincide with multiple policies covering a wide range of time periods for a single insured. environmental claims present exposure for remediation and defense costs associated with the contamination of property as a result of pollution. it is common, especially for larger defendants, to be named as a potentially responsible party at multiple sites. the following table presents count information for asbestos claims by causative agent and environmental claims by site, for direct policies only: asbestos (by causative agent) environmental (by site) 2014 2013 2014 2013 open at beginning of year 1,107 1,058 3,339 3,390 newly reported 64 69 201 138 closed or otherwise disposed 44 20 422 189 open at end of year 1,127 1,107 3,118 3,339 closed or otherwise disposed environmental sites were higher in 2014 primarily due to several settlements and a continuous review of pending cases completed in prior years. survival ratios are calculated by dividing the asbestos or environmental loss and allocated loss adjustment expense (alae) reserves by the average asbestos or environmental loss and alae payments for the three most recent calendar years (3 year survival ratio). the 3 year survival ratios for gross and net asbestos loss and alae reserves were 3.9 years and 4.4 years, respectively. the 3 year survival ratios for gross and net environmental loss and alae reserves were 2.0 years and 1.8 years, respectively. the survival ratios provide only a very rough depiction of reserves and are significantly impacted by a number of factors such as aggressive settlement practices, variations in gross to ceded relationships within the asbestos or environmental claims, and levels of coverage provided. we, therefore, urge caution in using these very simplistic ratios to gauge reserve adequacy. 75 _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ catastrophe management we actively monitor our catastrophe risk accumulation around the world. the table below presents our modeled annual aggregate pre-tax probable maximum loss (pml), net of reinsurance, for 100-year and 250-year return periods for u.s. hurricane and california earthquake at december 31, 2014 and 2013. the table also presents ace's corresponding share of pre-tax industry losses for each of the return periods for u.s. hurricane and california earthquake. for example, according to the model, for the 1-in-100 return period scenario, there is a one percent chance that our losses incurred in any year from u.s. hurricane events could be in excess of $1,757 million (or 5.9 percent of our total shareholders' equity at december 31, 2014). we estimate that at such hypothetical loss levels, ace's share of aggregate industry losses would be approximately 1.1 percent. u.s. hurricane california earthquake december 31 december 31 december 31 december 31 2014 2013 2014 2013 modeled annual aggregate net pml ace % of totalshareholders'equity % ofindustry ace ace % of totalshareholders'equity % ofindustry ace (in millions of u.s. dollars, except for percentages)

portfolio at october 1, 2014 and reinsurance program at january 1, 2015. the modeling estimates at december 31, 2013 reflected our reinsurance program at january 1, 2014, which excluded named storm coverage in north america for the time period generally considered outside u.s. hurricane season. while this exclusion carried nominal risk, it impacted the point in time pml estimate in the prior year as the point in time estimate does not take into account the seasonality of hurricanes. we had defined \"named storm\" as a storm or storm system that has been declared by the national hurricane center (nhc) to be a tropical cyclone, tropical storm or a hurricane and includes wind, gusts, hail, rain, tornadoes or cyclones related to such storm. ace established a new global property catastrophe program for our north american and international operations that provided global natural catastrophe and terrorism coverage that was effective as of july 1, 2014. refer to \"natural catastrophe property reinsurance program\" for additional information. as a result of the new reinsurance program, the modeled pml for u.s. hurricane at december 31, 2014 is lower compared to december 31, 2013. the modeling estimates of both ace and industry loss levels are inherently uncertain owing to key assumptions. first, while the use of third-party catastrophe modeling packages to simulate potential hurricane and earthquake losses is prevalent within the insurance industry, the models are reliant upon significant meteorology, seismology, and engineering assumptions to estimate hurricane and earthquake losses. in particular, modeled hurricane and earthquake events are not always a representation of actual events and ensuing additional loss potential. second, there is no universal standard in the preparation of insured data for use in the models and the running of the modeling software. third, we are reliant upon third-party estimates of industry insured exposures and there is significant variation possible around the relationship between our loss and that of the industry following an event. fourth, we assume that our reinsurance recoveries following an event are fully collectible. these loss estimates do not represent our potential maximum exposures and it is highly likely that our actual incurred losses would vary materially from the modeled estimates. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ natural catastrophe property reinsurance program ace's core property catastrophe reinsurance program provides protection against natural catastrophes impacting its primary property operations (i.e., excluding our global reinsurance and life segments). we regularly review our reinsurance protection and corresponding property catastrophe exposures. this may or may not lead to the purchase of additional reinsurance prior to a program's renewal date. in addition, prior to each renewal date, we consider how much, if any, coverage we intend to buy and we may make material changes to the current structure in light of various factors, including modeled pml assessment at various return periods, reinsurance pricing, our risk tolerance and exposures, and various other structuring considerations. 76 ace established a new global catastrophe program for our north american and international operations. the program is effective july 1, 2014 through june 30, 2015, and consists of two layers in excess of losses retained by ace. approximately 20 percent of the coverage was placed with reinsurers providing upfront collateral equal to the limit of their participation and without a reinstatement. the remaining coverage was placed without upfront collateral and with one additional reinstatement limit in the event of a natural peril loss. in addition, we also purchased terrorism coverage (excluding nuclear, biological, chemical and radiation coverage) for the united states from july 1, 2014 to june 30, 2015 with the same limits and retention and percentage placed except that the majority of terrorism coverage is on an aggregate basis above our retentions without a reinstatement. loss location layer of loss comments notes united states $0 million - $500 million losses retained by ace (a) (excluding alaska and hawaii) united states $500 million -$1.0 billion

underlying per risk programs and certain other catastrophe programs purchased by individual business units. these other catastrophe programs have the potential to reduce our effective retention below the stated levels. (b) these coverages are both part of the same core layer within the global catastrophe program and are approximately 90% placed with reinsurers. as such, it may be exhausted in one region and not available in the other. (c) these coverages are both part of the same second layer within the global catastrophe program and are approximately 98% placed with reinsurers. as such, it may be exhausted in one region and not available in the other. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ political risk, trade credit, and structured trade credit political risk insurance is a specialized coverage that provides clients with protection against unexpected, catastrophic political or macroeconomic events, primarily in developing markets. we participate in this market through our wholly-owned subsidiary sovereign risk insurance ltd. (sovereign), and through a unit of our london-based agm operation. sovereign is one of the world's leading underwriters of political risk insurance and has a global portfolio spread across more than 100 countries. its clients include financial institutions, national export credit agencies, leading multilateral agencies, and multinational corporations. agm writes political risk, trade credit, and structured trade credit business out of underwriting offices in london, england; hamburg, germany; sao paulo, brazil; singapore; and in the u.s. in the following locations: new york, new york; los angeles; california; and washington, d.c. our political risk insurance provides protection to commercial lenders against defaults on cross border loans, insulates investors against equity losses, and protects exporters against defaults on contracts. commercial lenders, our largest client segment, are covered for missed scheduled loan repayments due to acts of confiscation, expropriation or nationalization by the host government, currency inconvertibility or exchange transfer restrictions, or war or other acts of political violence. in addition, in the case of loans to government-owned entities or loans that have a government guarantee, political risk policies cover scheduled payments against risks of non-payment or non-honoring of government guarantees. equity investors and corporations receive similar coverage to that of lenders, except they are protected against financial losses, inability to repatriate dividends, and physical damage to their operations caused by covered events. our export contracts protection provides coverage for both exporters and their financing banks against the risk of contract frustration due to government actions, including non-payment by government entities. 77 agm's trade credit and structured trade credit businesses cover losses due to insolvency, protracted default, and political risk perils including export and license cancellation. it provides trade credit coverage to larger companies that have sophisticated credit risk management systems, with exposure to multiple customers and that have the ability to self-insure losses up to a certain level through excess of loss coverage. its structured trade credit business provides coverage to trade finance banks, exporters, and trading companies, with exposure to trade-related financing instruments. we have implemented structural features in our policies in order to control potential losses within the political risk, trade credit, and structured credit businesses. these include basic loss sharing features that include co-insurance and deductibles, and in the case of trade credit, the use of non-qualifying losses that drop smaller exposures deemed too difficult to assess. ultimate loss severity is also limited by using waiting periods to enable the insurer and insured to agree on recovery strategies, and the subrogation of the rights of the lender/exporter to the insurer following a claim. we have the option to pay claims over the original loan payment schedule, rather than in a lump sum in order to provide insureds and the insurer additional time to remedy problems and work towards full recoveries. it is important to note that political risk, trade credit, and structured trade credit policies are named peril conditional contracts, not financial guarantees, and claims are only paid after conditions and warranties are fulfilled. political risk, trade credit, and structured trade credit insurance do not cover currency devaluations, bond defaults, any form of derivatives, movements in overseas equity markets, transactions deemed illegal, or situations where corruption or misrepresentation has occurred, or debt that is not legally enforceable. in addition to assessing and mitigating potential exposure on a policy-by-policy basis, we also have specific risk management measures in place to manage overall exposure and risk. these measures include placing country and individual transaction limits based on country risk and credit ratings, combined single loss limits on multi-country policies, the use of reinsurance protection, and regular modeling and stress-testing of the portfolio. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ crop insurance we are, and have been since the 1980s, one of the leading writers of crop insurance in the u.s. and have conducted that business through a managing general agent subsidiary of rain and hail. we provide protection throughout the u.s. on a variety of crops and are therefore geographically diversified, which reduces the risk of exposure to a single event or a heavy accumulation of losses in any one region. our crop insurance business comprises two components - multiple peril crop insurance (mpci) and crop-hail insurance. the mpci program is offered in conjunction with the u.s. department of agriculture (usda). the policies cover revenue shortfalls or production losses due to natural causes such as drought, excessive moisture, hail, wind, frost, insects, and disease. generally, policies have deductibles ranging from 10 percent to 50 percent of the insured's risk. the usda's risk management agency (rma) sets the policy terms and conditions, rates and forms, and is also responsible for setting compliance standards. as a participating company, we report all details of policies underwritten to the rma and are party to a standard reinsurance agreement (sra). the sra sets out the relationship between private insurance companies and the federal crop insurance corporation (fcic) concerning the terms and conditions regarding the risks each will bear including the pro-rata and state stop-loss provisions which allows companies to limit the exposure of any one state or group of states on their underwriting results. in addition to the pro-rata and excess of loss reinsurance protections inherent in the sra, we also purchase third-party proportional and stop-loss reinsurance for our mpci business to reduce our exposure. we may also enter into crop derivative contracts to further manage our risk exposure. each year the rma issues a final sra for the subsequent reinsurance year. in june 2014, the rma released the 2015 sra which establishes the terms and conditions for the 2015 reinsurance year (i.e., july 1, 2014 through june 30, 2015) that replaced the 2014 sra. there were no significant changes in the terms and conditions. on the mpci business, we recognize net premiums written as soon as estimable, which is generally when we receive acreage reports from the policyholders on the various crops throughout the u.s. this allows us to best determine the premium associated with the liability that is being planted. the mpci program has specific timeframes as to when producers must report acreage to us and in certain cases, the reporting occurs after the close of the respective reinsurance year. once the net premium written has been recorded, the premium is then earned over the growing season for the crops. a majority of the crops that are covered in the program are typically subject to the sra in effect at the beginning of the year. given the major crops covered in the program, we typically see a substantial written and earned premium impact in the second and third quarters. the pricing of mpci premium is determined using a number of factors including commodity prices and related volatility. for instance, in most states the pricing for the mpci revenue product for corn includes a factor that is based on the average price 78 in february of the chicago board of trade december corn futures. to the extent that the corn commodity prices are higher in february than they were in the previous february, and all other factors are the same, the increase in corn prices will increase the corn premium year over year. our crop-hail program is a private offering. premium is earned on the crop-hail program over the coverage period of the policy. given the very short nature of the growing season, most crop-hail business is typically written in the second and third quarters with the earned premium also more heavily occurring during this time frame. we use industry data to develop our own rates and forms for the coverage offered. the policy primarily protects farmers against yield reduction caused by hail and/or fire, and related costs such as transit to storage. we offer various deductibles to allow the grower to partially self-insure for a reduced premium cost. we limit our crop-hail exposures through the use of township liability limits and third-party proportional and stop-loss reinsurance on our net retained hail business. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ liquidity liquidity is a measure of a company's ability to generate cash flows sufficient to meet short-term and long-term cash requirements. as a holding company, ace limited possesses assets that consist primarily of the stock of its subsidiaries and other investments. in addition to net investment income, ace limited's cash flows depend primarily on dividends or other statutorily permissible payments. historically, these dividends and other payments have come from ace's bermuda-based operating subsidiaries, which we refer to as our bermuda subsidiaries. our consolidated sources of funds consist primarily of net premiums written, fees, net investment income, and proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. funds are used at our various companies primarily to pay claims, operating expenses, and dividends, to service debt, and to purchase investments. we anticipate that positive cash flows from operations (underwriting activities and investment income) should be sufficient to cover cash outflows under most loss scenarios for the near term. should the need arise, we generally have access to capital markets and available credit facilities. refer to \"credit facilities\" below for additional information. our access to funds under an existing credit facility is dependent on the ability of the bank that is a party to the facility to meet its funding commitments. our existing credit facility has a remaining term expiring in november 2017 and requires that we maintain certain financial covenants, all of which we met at december 31, 2014. should our existing credit provider experience financial difficulty, we may be required to replace credit sources, possibly in a difficult market. if we cannot obtain adequate capital or sources of credit on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. to date, we have not experienced difficulty accessing our credit facility. to further ensure the sufficiency of funds to settle unforeseen claims, we hold certain invested assets in cash and short-term investments. in addition, for certain insurance, reinsurance, or deposit contracts that tend to have relatively large and reasonably predictable cash outflows, we attempt to establish dedicated portfolios of assets that are duration-matched with the related liabilities. with respect to the duration of our overall investment portfolio, we manage asset durations to both maximize return given current market conditions and provide sufficient liquidity to cover future loss payments. all things being equal, in a low interest rate environment, the overall duration of our fixed maturities tends to be shorter and in a high interest rate environment, such duration tends to be longer. at december 31, 2014, the average duration of our fixed maturities (4.0 years) is less than the average expected duration of our insurance liabilities (4.8 years). the increase in duration of our insurance liabilities (4.8 years in 2014 and 4.5 years in 2013) is principally due to decreases in interest rates in 2014. despite our safeguards, if paid losses accelerate beyond our ability to fund such paid losses from current operating cash flows, we might need to either liquidate a portion of our investment portfolio or arrange for financing. potential events causing such a liquidity strain could include several significant catastrophes occurring in a relatively short period of time, large uncollectible reinsurance recoverables on paid losses (as a result of coverage disputes, reinsurers' credit problems, or decreases in the value of collateral supporting reinsurance recoverables) or increases in collateral postings under our variable annuity reinsurance business. because each subsidiary focuses on a more limited number of specific product lines than is collectively available from the ace group of companies, the mix of business tends to be less diverse at the subsidiary level. as a result, the probability of a liquidity strain, as described above, may be greater for individual subsidiaries than when liquidity is assessed on a consolidated basis. if such a liquidity strain were to occur in a subsidiary, we could be required to liquidate a portion of our investments, potentially at distressed prices, as well as be required to contribute capital to the particular subsidiary and/or curtail dividends from the subsidiary to support holding company operations. the payment of dividends or other statutorily permissible distributions from our operating companies are subject to the laws and regulations applicable to each jurisdiction, as well as the need to maintain capital levels adequate to support the insurance 79 and reinsurance operations, including financial strength ratings issued by independent rating agencies. during 2014, we were able to meet all of our obligations, including the payments of dividends on our common shares, with our net cash flows. we assess which subsidiaries to draw dividends from based on a number of factors. considerations such as regulatory and legal restrictions as well as the subsidiary's financial condition are paramount to the dividend decision. ace limited received dividends of $300 million and $825 million from its bermuda subsidiaries in 2014 and 2013, respectively. the payment of any dividends from agm or its subsidiaries is subject to applicable u.k. insurance laws and regulations. in addition, the release of funds by syndicate 2488 to subsidiaries of agm is subject to regulations promulgated by the society of lloyd's. ace limited received no dividends from agm in 2014 and 2013. the u.s. insurance subsidiaries of ace ina holdings inc. (ace ina) may pay dividends, without prior regulatory approval, subject to restrictions set out in state law of the subsidiary's domicile (or, if applicable, commercial domicile). ace ina's international subsidiaries are also subject to insurance laws and regulations particular to the countries in which the subsidiaries operate. these laws and regulations sometimes include restrictions that limit the amount of dividends payable without prior approval of regulatory insurance authorities. ace limited received no dividends from ace ina in 2014 and 2013. debt issued by ace ina is serviced by statutorily permissible distributions by ace ina's insurance subsidiaries to ace ina as well as other group resources. ace ina received $401 million of dividends from its subsidiaries, of which $374 million was paid in cash, in 2014 and no dividends in 2013. at december 31, 2014, the amount of dividends available to be paid to ace ina in 2015 from its subsidiaries without prior approval of insurance regulatory authorities totals $1.1 billion. cash flows our insurance and reinsurance operations provide liquidity in that premiums are received in advance, sometimes substantially in advance, of the time claims are paid. generally, cash flows are affected by claim payments that, due to the nature of our operations, may comprise large loss payments on a limited number of claims and which can fluctuate significantly from period to period. the irregular timing of these loss payments can create significant variations in cash flows from operations between periods. refer to \"contractual obligations and commitments\" for our estimate of future claim payments by period. sources of liquidity include cash from operations, routine sales of investments, and financing arrangements. the following is a discussion of our cash flows for 2014, 2013, and 2012. operating cash flows reflect net income for each period, adjusted for non-cash items and changes in working capital. operating cash flows were $4.5 billion in 2014, compared with $4.0 billion in both 2013 and 2012. operating cash flows increased in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily due to higher net premiums collected of $1.0 billion, partially offset by higher net losses paid of $406 million. operating cash flows in 2013 were comparable to 2012, as higher net premiums collected of $276 million and lower income taxes paid of $220 million were offset by higher net losses paid of $287 million and higher expenses paid of $136 million. cash used for investing was $2.5 billion in 2014, compared with $4.4 billion and $3.4 billion in 2013 and 2012, respectively. cash used for investing in 2014 was lower compared to 2013 primarily due to lower net purchases of fixed maturities. cash used for investing in 2013 was higher compared to 2012 primarily due to the acquisitions of aba seguros and fianzas monterrey of $977 million, compared to acquisitions in 2012 of $98 million. cash used for financing was $1.8 billion in 2014, compared with cash flows from financing of $391 million in 2013, and cash used for financing of $550 million in 2012. cash used for financing in 2014 included $1.4 billion of share repurchases and $862 million of dividends paid on common shares. cash flows from financing in 2013 included $947 million of proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, partially offset by dividends paid on common shares of $517 million. cash used for financing in 2012 primarily related to dividends paid on common shares of $815 million. dividends paid on common shares were higher in 2014 compared to 2013 due to a $0.12 per share increase in our quarterly dividend approved by our shareholders in january 2014 and an additional three percent increase approved by our shareholders at our may 2014 annual general meeting. dividends paid on common shares in 2013 were lower compared to 2012 due to the accelerated payment of the fourth quarter 2012 dividend in december 2012, which would normally have been paid in the first quarter 2013. both internal and external forces influence our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. claim settlements, premium levels, and investment returns may be impacted by changing rates of inflation and other economic conditions. in many cases, significant periods of time, ranging up to several years or more, may lapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to us, and the settlement of the liability for that loss. 80 in the current low interest rate environment, we use repurchase agreements as a low-cost alternative for short-term funding needs and to address short-term cash timing differences without disrupting our investment portfolio holdings. at december 31, 2014, there were $1.4 billion in repurchase agreements outstanding. in addition to cash from operations, routine sales of investments, and financing arrangements, we have agreements with a third-party bank provider which implemented two international multi-currency notional cash pooling programs to enhance cash management efficiency during periods of short-term timing mismatches between expected inflows and outflows of cash by currency. the programs allow us to optimize investment income by avoiding portfolio disruption. in each program, participating ace entities establish deposit accounts in different currencies with the bank provider. each day the credit or debit balances in every account are notionally translated into a single currency (u.s. dollars) and then notionally pooled. the bank extends overdraft credit to all participating ace entities as needed, provided that the overall notionally pooled balance of all accounts in each pool at the end of each day is at least zero. actual cash balances are not physically converted and are not commingled between legal entities. ace entities may incur overdraft balances as a means to address short-term liquidity needs. any overdraft balances incurred under this program by an ace entity would be guaranteed by ace limited (up to $300 million in the aggregate). our syndicated letter of credit facility allows for same day drawings to fund a net pool overdraft should participating ace entities withdraw contributed funds from the pool.

deployed to support our business operations. december 31 december 31 (in millions of u.s. dollars, except for percentages) 2014 2013 short-term debt $2,552 $1,901 long-term debt 3,357 3,807 total debt

november 2015, from long-term debt to short-term debt in the consolidated balance sheet. in may 2014, we issued $700 million of 3.35 percent senior notes due may 2024. the proceeds from the debt issuance are expected to be used to repay at maturity the $700 million of 2.6 percent senior notes due november 2015. in june 2014, ace ina's $500 million of 5.875 percent senior notes matured and were fully paid. for discussion of our debt outstanding, refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. we believe our financial strength provides us with the flexibility and capacity to obtain available funds externally through debt or equity financing on both a short-term and long-term basis. our ability to access the capital markets is dependent on, among other things, market conditions and our perceived financial strength. we have accessed both the debt and equity markets from time to time. we generally maintain the ability to issue certain classes of debt and equity securities via an unlimited sec shelf registration which is renewed every three years. this allows us capital market access for refinancing as well as for unforeseen or opportunistic capital needs. our current shelf registration on file with the sec expires in december 2017. as part of our capital management program, in november 2013, our board of directors (board) authorized the repurchase of up to $2.0 billion of ace's common shares through december 31, 2014, replacing prior board authorizations. we repurchased $1,449 million, $290 million, and $7 million of common shares in a series of open market transactions in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. as of december 31, 2014, there were 14,172,726 common shares in treasury with a weighted average cost of $102.17 per share. 81 in november 2014, our board authorized the repurchase of $1.5 billion of ace's common shares through december 31, 2015, replacing the november 2013 authorization when it expired on december 31, 2014. for the period january 1, 2015 through february 26, 2015, we repurchased 1,877,463 common shares for a total of $211 million in a series of open market transactions. at february 26, 2015, $1.3 billion in share repurchase authorization remained through december 31, 2015. common shares our common shares had a par value of chf 24.77 each at december 31, 2014. under swiss law, dividends must be stated in swiss francs though dividend payments are made by ace in u.s. dollars. following ace's redomestication to switzerland, dividends have generally been distributed by way of a par value reduction (under the methods approved by our shareholders at our annual general meetings). our annual dividend is payable in four quarterly installments. at the january 10, 2014 extraordinary general meeting, our shareholders approved a resolution to increase our quarterly dividend 24 percent from $0.51 per share to $0.63 per share for the payments made on january 31, 2014 and april 17, 2014, with the $0.12 per share increase for each installment distributed from capital contribution reserves (and the $0.51 per share distributed by way of par value reduction). at our may 2014 annual general meeting, our shareholders approved an annual dividend for the following year of $2.60 per share, payable in four quarterly installments of $0.65 per share after the annual general meeting in the form of a distribution by way of a par value reduction. refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our dividends. dividend distributions on common shares amounted to chf 2.47 ($2.70) per share for the year ended december 31, 2014 (including par value reductions of chf 2.27 per share).

commitments $69,274 $13,812 $13,488 $8,370 $33,604 (1) refer to note 1 k) to the consolidated financial statements. (2) primarily comprises audit fees and agreements with vendors to purchase system software administration and maintenance services. (3) the timing of the payments of these commitments is uncertain and will differ from the estimated timing in the table. 82 the above table excludes the following items: • pension obligations: minimum funding requirements for our pension obligations are immaterial. subsequent funding commitments are apt to vary due to many factors and are difficult to estimate at this time. refer to note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. • liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits: the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest, was $23 million at december 31, 2014. we recognize accruals for interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations. at december 31, 2014, we had $9 million in liabilities for income tax-related interest and penalties in our consolidated balance sheets. we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate for the timing of cash settlement with respect to these liabilities. refer to note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. we have no other significant contractual obligations or commitments not reflected in the table above. we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. estimated gross loss payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts we are obligated to pay claims under insurance and reinsurance contracts for specified loss events covered under those contracts. such loss payments represent our most significant future payment obligation as a p&c insurance and reinsurance company. in contrast to other contractual obligations, cash payments are not determinable from the terms specified within the contract. for example, we do not ultimately make a payment to our counterparty for many insurance and reinsurance contracts (i.e., when a loss event has not occurred) and if a payment is to be made, the amount and timing cannot be determined from the contract. in the table above, we estimate payments by period relating to our gross liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses included in the consolidated balance sheet at december 31, 2014, and do not take into account reinsurance recoverable. these estimated loss payments are inherently uncertain and the amount and timing of actual loss payments are likely to differ from these estimates and the differences could be material. given the numerous factors and assumptions involved in both estimates of loss and loss expense reserves and related estimates as to the timing of future loss and loss expense payments in the table above, differences between actual and estimated loss payments will not necessarily indicate a commensurate change in ultimate loss estimates. the liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses presented in our balance sheet is discounted for certain structured settlements for which the timing and amount of future claim payments are reliably determinable and certain reserves for unsettled claims that are discounted in statutory filings. accordingly, the estimated amounts in the table exceed the liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses presented in our balance sheet. refer to note 1 h) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. estimated payments for future policy benefits we establish reserves for future policy benefits for life, long-term health, and annuity contracts. the amounts in the table are gross of fees or premiums due from the underlying contracts. the liability for future policy benefits for life, long-term health, and annuity contracts presented in our balance sheet is discounted and reflected net of fees or premiums due from the underlying contracts. accordingly, the estimated amounts in the table exceed the liability for future policy benefits presented in our balance sheet. payment amounts related to these reserves must be estimated and are not determinable from the contract. due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing and amount of these payments, actual results could materially differ from the estimates in the table. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ credit facilities as our bermuda subsidiaries are non-admitted insurers and reinsurers in the u.s., the terms of certain u.s. insurance and reinsurance contracts require them to provide collateral, which can be in the form of letters of credit (locs). locs may also be used for general corporate purposes. we have a $1 billion unsecured operational loc facility guaranteed by ace limited (adjustable to $1.5 billion upon consent of the issuers) expiring in november 2017. we are allowed to use up to $300 million of this loc facility as an unsecured revolving credit facility. at december 31, 2014, outstanding locs issued under this facility were $479 million. 83 we did not renew our $500 million bilateral loc facility that expired in june 2014. we also did not renew our $425 million series of four bilateral uncollateralized loc facilities supporting agm underwriting capacity for lloyd's syndicate 2488. we elected instead to satisfy our collateral obligations primarily by pledging additional fixed income securities from our investment portfolio into existing insurance trusts. it is anticipated that our $1 billion unsecured operational loc facility will be renewed on expiry but such renewal is subject to the availability of credit from banks utilized by ace. in the event that such credit support is insufficient, we could be required to provide alternative security to clients. this could take the form of additional insurance trusts supported by our investment portfolio or funds withheld using our cash resources. the value of locs required is driven by, among other things, statutory liabilities reported by variable annuity guarantee reinsurance clients, loss development of existing reserves, the payment pattern of such reserves, the expansion of business, and loss experience of such business. the facility noted above requires that we maintain certain covenants, all of which have been met at december 31, 2014. these covenants include: (i) maintenance of a minimum consolidated net worth in an amount not less than the \"minimum amount\". for the purpose of this calculation, the minimum amount is an amount equal to the sum of the base amount (currently $20.2 billion) plus 25 percent of consolidated net income for each fiscal quarter, ending after the date on which the current base amount became effective, plus 50 percent of any increase in consolidated net worth during the same period, attributable to the issuance of common and preferred shares. the minimum amount is subject to an annual reset provision. (ii) maintenance of a maximum debt to total capitalization ratio of not greater than 0.35 to 1. under this covenant, debt does not include trust preferred securities or mezzanine equity, except where the ratio of the sum of trust preferred securities and mezzanine equity to total capitalization is greater than 15 percent. in this circumstance, the amount greater than 15 percent would be included in the debt to total capitalization ratio. at december 31, 2014, (a) the minimum consolidated net worth requirement under the covenant described in (i) above was $20.9 billion and our actual consolidated net worth as calculated under that covenant was $27.7 billion and (b) our ratio of debt to total capitalization was 0.165 to 1, which is below the maximum debt to total capitalization ratio of 0.35 to 1 as described in (ii) above. our failure to comply with the covenants under any credit facility would, subject to grace periods in the case of certain covenants, result in an event of default. this could require us to repay any outstanding borrowings or to cash collateralize locs under such facility. our failure to repay material financial obligations, as well as our failure with respect to certain other events expressly identified, would result in an event of default under the facility. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ ratings ace limited and its subsidiaries are assigned credit and financial strength (insurance) ratings from internationally recognized rating agencies, including s&p, a.m. best, moody's, and fitch. the ratings issued on our companies by these agencies are announced publicly and are available directly from the agencies. our internet site (www.acegroup.com, under investor information) also contains some information about our ratings, but such information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this report. financial strength ratings reflect the rating agencies' opinions of a company's claims paying ability. independent ratings are one of the important factors that establish our competitive position in the insurance markets. the rating agencies consider many factors in determining the financial strength rating of an insurance company, including the relative level of statutory surplus necessary to support the business operations of the company. these ratings are based upon factors relevant to policyholders, agents, and intermediaries and are not directed toward the protection of investors. such ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities. credit ratings assess a company's ability to make timely payments of principal and interest on its debt. it is possible that, in the future, one or more of the rating agencies may reduce our existing ratings. if one or more of our ratings were downgraded, we could incur higher borrowing costs, and our ability to access the capital markets could be impacted. in addition, our insurance and reinsurance operations could be adversely impacted by a downgrade in our financial strength 84 ratings, including a possible reduction in demand for our products in certain markets. also, we have insurance and reinsurance contracts which contain rating triggers. in the event the s&p or a.m. best financial strength ratings of ace fall, we may be faced with the cancellation of premium or be required to post collateral on our underlying obligation associated with this premium. we estimate that at december 31, 2014, a one-notch downgrade of our s&p or a.m. best financial strength ratings would result in an immaterial loss of premium or requirement for collateral to be posted.\"\"\"\n\nInstruction:\nIdentify and extract sentences or phrases that are directly or indirectly related to \"IT capability\", including but not limited to: information technology (it) capabilities have been evolving in scope to more comprehensively encompass the coordination of a firm’s assets and internal processes and their interfirm transactions and relationships.

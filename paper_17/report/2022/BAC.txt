item 1a. risk factors the discussion below addresses our material risk factors of which we are aware. any risk factor, either by itself or together with other risk factors, could materially and adversely affect our businesses, results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition. references to third parties may include their upstream and downstream service providers who may also contribute to our risks. other factors not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial could also adversely affect our businesses, results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition. therefore, the risk factors below should not be considered all of the potential risks that we may face. for more information on how we manage risks, see managing risk in the md&a on page 46. for more information about the risks contained in the risk factors section, see item 1. business on page 2, md&a on page 26 and notes to consolidated financial statements on page 94.
market we may be adversely affected by the financial markets, fiscal, monetary, and regulatory policies, and economic conditions.
general economic, political, social and health conditions in the u.s. and abroad affect financial markets and our business. in particular, global markets may be affected by the level and volatility of interest rates, availability and market conditions of financing, changes in gross domestic product (gdp), economic growth or its sustainability, inflation, supply chain disruptions, consumer spending, employment levels, labor shortages, challenging labor market conditions, wage stagnation, federal government shutdowns, energy prices, home prices, commercial property values, bankruptcies, a default by a significant market participant or class of counterparties, including companies in emerging markets, fluctuations or other significant changes in both debt and equity capital markets and currencies, liquidity, the continued transition from interbank offered rates (ibors) and other benchmark rates to alternative reference rates (arrs), the impact of volatility of digital assets on the broader market, the growth of global trade and commerce, trade policies, the availability and cost of capital and credit, disruption of communication, transportation or energy infrastructure, recessionary fears and investor sentiment. global markets, including energy and commodity markets, may be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of climate change, acute and/or chronic extreme weather events or natural disasters, the emergence or continuation of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, cyberattacks, military conflict, terrorism, or other geopolitical events. market fluctuations may impact our margin requirements and affect our liquidity. any sudden or prolonged market downturn, as a result of the above factors or otherwise, could result in a decline in net interest income and noninterest income and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including capital and liquidity levels. high inflation, elevated interest rate levels, supply chain disruptions, and the russia/ukraine conflict, including the related energy impact in europe, have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact financial markets and macroeconomic conditions and could result in additional market volatility and disruptions.
global uncertainties regarding fiscal and monetary policies present economic challenges. actions taken by the federal reserve or other central banks, including changes in target rates, balance sheet management and lending facilities, are beyond our control and difficult to predict, particularly in a high inflation environment. this can affect interest rates and the value of financial instruments and other assets, such as debt securities, and impact our borrowers and potentially increase delinquency rates and may also raise government debt levels, adversely affect businesses and household incomes and increase uncertainty surrounding monetary policy. monetary policy in response to high inflation has led to a significant increase in market interest rates and a flattening and/or inversion of the yield curve. this has resulted in and may continue to result in volatility of equity and other markets, further volatility of the u.s. dollar, a widening in credit spreads and higher interest rates and recessionary concerns, and could result in elevated unemployment, which could impact investor risk appetite and our borrowers, potentially increasing delinquency rates. it is also possible that high inflation may limit the scope of monetary support, including cuts to the federal funds rate, in the event of an economic downturn, resulting in a more protracted period of a flat and/or inverted yield curve.
any future change in monetary policy by the federal reserve, in an effort to stimulate the economy or otherwise, resulting in lower interest rates would likely result in lower revenue through lower net interest income, which could adversely affect our results of operations. additionally, changes to existing u.s. laws and regulatory policies and evolving priorities, including those related to financial regulation, taxation, international trade, fiscal policy, climate change (including efforts to transition to a low-carbon economy) and healthcare, may adversely impact u.s. or global economic activity and our customers', our counterparties' and our earnings and operations. globally, many central banks are simultaneously reducing monetary accommodation through interest rate or balance sheet policy, which has contributed and may continue to contribute to elevated financial and capital market volatility and significant changes to asset values. while higher interest rates have positively impacted our net interest income, higher interest rates have negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact deposits, loan demand and funding costs. if the u.s. government's debt ceiling limit is not raised, the ramifications could result in market volatility, ratings downgrades and limit fiscal policy responses to recessionary conditions. this could have a negative and potentially severe impact on the u.s. and world economy and financial and capital markets, including higher interest rates, higher volatility, lower asset values, lower liquidity, downgrades to u.s. debt, and a weakened u.s. dollar.
changes to international trade and investment policies by the u.s. could negatively impact financial markets. escalation of tensions between the u.s. and the people's republic of china (china) could lead to further u.s. measures that adversely affect financial markets, disrupt world trade and commerce and lead to trade retaliation, including through the use of tariffs, foreign exchange measures or the large-scale sale of u.s. treasury bonds. any restrictions on the activities of businesses, could also negatively affect financial markets.
these developments could adversely affect our businesses, customers, securities and derivatives portfolios, including the risk of lower re-investment rates within those portfolios, our level of charge-offs and provision for credit losses, the carrying value of our deferred tax assets, our capital levels, our liquidity and our results of operations.
increased market volatility and adverse changes in financial or capital market conditions may increase our market risk.
our liquidity, competitive position, business, results of operations and financial condition are affected by market risks such as changes in interest and currency exchange rates, fluctuations in equity, commodity and futures prices, trading volumes and prices of securitized products, the implied volatility of interest rates and credit spreads and other economic and bank of america business factors. these market risks may adversely affect, among other things, the value of our securities, including our on- and off-balance sheet securities, trading assets and other financial instruments, the cost of debt capital and our access to credit markets, the value of assets under management (aum), fee income relating to aum, customer allocation of capital among investment alternatives, the volume of client activity in our trading operations, investment banking, underwriting and other capital market fees, which have already been negatively impacted, the general profitability and risk level of the transactions in which we engage and our competitiveness with respect to deposit pricing. the value of certain of our assets is sensitive to changes in market interest rates. if the federal reserve or a non-u.s. central bank changes or signals a change in monetary policy, market interest rates or credit spreads could be affected, which could adversely impact the value of such assets. changes to fiscal policy, including expansion of u.s. federal deficit spending and resultant debt issuance, could also affect market interest rates. if interest rates decrease, our results of operations could be negatively impacted, including future revenue and earnings growth. the continued flattening and/or inversion of the yield curve could also negatively impact our results of operations, including revenue and earnings.
our models and strategies to assess and control our market risk exposures are subject to inherent limitations. in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated and vice versa. such changes to the relationship between market parameters may limit the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and cause us to incur significant losses. changes in correlation can be exacerbated where market participants use risk or trading models with assumptions or algorithms similar to ours. in these and other cases, it may be difficult to reduce our risk positions due to activity of other market participants or widespread market dislocations, including circumstances where asset values are declining significantly or no market exists. where we own securities that do not have an established liquid trading market or are otherwise subject to restrictions on sale or hedging, or where the degree of accessible liquidity declines significantly, we may not be able to reduce our positions and risks associated with such holdings, so we may suffer larger than expected losses when adverse price movements take place. this risk can be exacerbated where we hold a position that is large relative to the available liquidity.
if asset values decline, we may incur losses and negative impacts to capital and liquidity requirements.
we have a large portfolio of financial instruments, including loans and loan commitments, securities financing agreements, asset-backed secured financings, derivative assets and liabilities, debt securities, marketable equity securities and certain other assets and liabilities that we measure at fair value and are subject to valuation and impairment assessments. we determine these values based on applicable accounting guidance, which, for financial instruments measured at fair value, requires an entity to base fair value on exit price and to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in fair value measurements. the fair values of these financial instruments include adjustments for market liquidity, credit quality, funding impact on certain derivatives and other transaction-specific factors, where appropriate.
gains or losses on these instruments can have a direct impact on our results of operations, unless we have effectively hedged our exposures. increases in interest rates may result in further decreases in residential mortgage loan originations and could impact the origination of corporate debt. in addition, increases in interest rates or changes in spreads may continue to adversely impact the fair value of debt securities and, accordingly, for debt securities classified as available for sale, may continue to adversely affect accumulated other comprehensive income and, thus, capital levels. these market moves could also adversely impact our regulatory liquidity requirements. any decreases in interest rates may increase prepayment speeds of certain assets, and, therefore, could adversely affect net interest income. changes in interest rates also may impact the value of mortgage service rights retained.
fair values may be impacted by declining values of the underlying assets or the prices at which observable market transactions occur and the continued availability of these transactions or indices. the financial strength of counterparties, with whom we have economically hedged some of our exposure to these assets, also will affect the fair value of these assets. sudden declines and volatility in the prices of assets may curtail or eliminate trading activities in these assets, which may make it difficult to sell, hedge or value these assets. the inability to sell or effectively hedge assets reduces our ability to limit losses in such positions, and the difficulty in valuing assets may increase our risk-weighted assets (rwa), which requires us to maintain additional capital and increases our funding costs. values of aum also impact revenues in our wealth management and related advisory businesses for asset-based management and performance fees. declines in values of aum can result in lower fees earned for managing such assets.
liquidity if we are unable to access the capital markets, have prolonged net deposits outflows, or our borrowing costs increase, our liquidity and competitive position will be negatively affected.
liquidity is essential to our businesses. we fund our assets primarily with globally sourced deposits in our bank entities, as well as secured and unsecured liabilities transacted in the capital markets. we rely on certain secured funding sources, such as repo markets, which are typically short-term and credit-sensitive. we also engage in asset securitization transactions, including with the government-sponsored enterprises (gses), to fund consumer lending activities. our liquidity could be adversely affected by any inability to access the capital markets, illiquidity or volatility in the capital markets, the decrease in value of eligible collateral or increased collateral requirements (including as a result of credit concerns for short-term borrowing), changes to our relationships with our funding providers based on real or perceived changes in our risk profile, prolonged federal government shutdowns, or changes in regulations, guidance or gse status that impact our funding. additionally, our liquidity or cost of funds may be negatively impacted by the unwillingness or inability of the federal reserve to act as lender of last resort, unexpected simultaneous draws on lines of credit, slower customer payment rates, restricted access to the assets of prime brokerage clients, the withdrawal of or failure to attract customer deposits or invested funds (which could result from attrition driven by customers seeking higher yielding deposits or securities products, customer desire to utilize an alternative financial institution perceived to be safer, changes in customer spending behavior due to inflation, decline in the economy or other drivers resulting in an increased need for cash), increased regulatory liquidity, capital and margin requirements for our u.s. or international banks and their nonbank subsidiaries, which could result in the inability to transfer liquidity internally and inefficient funding, changes in patterns of intraday liquidity usage resulting from a counterparty or technology failure or other idiosyncratic event or failure or bank of america default by a significant market participant or third party (including clearing agents, custodians, central banks or central counterparty clearinghouses (ccps)). these factors also have the potential to increase our borrowing costs and negatively impact our liquidity.
several of these factors may arise due to circumstances beyond our control, such as general market volatility, disruption, shock or stress, the emergence or continuation of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, federal reserve policy decisions (including fluctuations in interest rates or federal reserve balance sheet composition), negative views or loss of confidence about us or the financial services industry generally or due to a specific news event, changes in the regulatory environment or governmental fiscal or monetary policies, actions by credit rating agencies or an operational problem that affects third parties or us. the impact of these potentially sudden events, whether within our control or not, could include an inability to sell assets or redeem investments, unforeseen outflows of cash, the need to draw on liquidity facilities, the reduction of financing balances and the loss of equity secured funding, debt repurchases to support the secondary market or meet client requests, the need for additional funding for commitments and contingencies and unexpected collateral calls, among other things, the result of which could be increased costs, a liquidity shortfall and/or impact on our liquidity coverage ratio.
our liquidity and cost of obtaining funding may be directly related to investor behavior, debt market disruption, firm specific concerns or prevailing market conditions, including changes in interest and currency exchange rates, significant fluctuations in equity and futures prices, lower trading volumes and prices of securitized products and our credit spreads. increases in interest rates and our credit spreads can increase the cost of our funding and result in mark-to-market or credit valuation adjustment exposures. changes in our credit spreads are market driven and may be influenced by market perceptions of our creditworthiness, including changes in our credit ratings or changes in broader financial market and macroeconomic conditions. changes to interest rates and our credit spreads occur continuously and may be unpredictable and highly volatile. we may also experience net interest margin compression as a result of offering higher than expected deposit rates in order to attract and maintain deposits. concentrations within our funding profile, such as maturities, currencies or counterparties, can reduce our funding efficiency.
reduction in our credit ratings could limit our access to funding or the capital markets, increase borrowing costs or trigger additional collateral or funding requirements.
our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are directly impacted by our credit ratings. credit ratings may also be important to investors, customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and seek to engage in certain transactions, including over-the-counter (otc) derivatives. our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by rating agencies, which consider a number of financial and non-financial factors, including our franchise, financial strength, performance and prospects, management, governance, risk management practices, capital adequacy, asset quality and operations, among other criteria, as well as factors not under our control, such as regulatory developments, the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment and changes to the methodologies used to determine our ratings, or ratings generally.
rating agencies could make adjustments to our credit ratings at any time and there can be no assurance as to whether or when any downgrades could occur. a reduction in our credit ratings could result in a wider credit spread and negatively affect our liquidity, access to credit markets, the related cost of funds, our businesses and certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where counterparty creditworthiness is critical. if the short-term credit ratings of our parent company, or bank or broker-dealer subsidiaries, were downgraded by one or more levels, we may experience loss of access to short-term funding sources such as repo financing, and/or incur increased cost of funds and increased collateral requirements. under the terms of certain otc derivative contracts and other trading agreements, if our or our subsidiaries' credit ratings are downgraded, the counterparties may require additional collateral or terminate these contracts or agreements.
while certain potential impacts are contractual and quantifiable, the full consequences of a credit rating downgrade are inherently uncertain and depend upon numerous dynamic, complex and inter-related factors and assumptions, including the relationship between long-term and short-term credit ratings and the behaviors of customers, investors and counterparties.
bank of america corporation is a holding company, is dependent on its subsidiaries for liquidity and may be restricted from transferring funds from subsidiaries.
bank of america corporation, as the parent company, is a separate and distinct legal entity from our bank and nonbank subsidiaries. we evaluate and manage liquidity on a legal entity basis. legal entity liquidity is an important consideration as there are legal, regulatory, contractual and other limitations on our ability to utilize liquidity from one legal entity to satisfy the liquidity requirements of another, including the parent company, which could result in adverse liquidity events. the parent company depends on dividends, distributions, loans and other payments from our bank and nonbank subsidiaries to fund dividend payments on our preferred stock and common stock and to fund all payments on our other obligations, including debt obligations. any inability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds, pay dividends or make payments to us may adversely affect our cash flow and financial condition.
many of our subsidiaries, including our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to laws that restrict dividend payments, or authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to the parent company or other subsidiaries. our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to lend or transact with affiliates, minimum regulatory capital and liquidity requirements and restrictions on their ability to use funds deposited with them in bank or brokerage accounts to fund their businesses. intercompany arrangements we entered into in connection with our resolution planning submissions could restrict the amount of funding available to the parent company from our subsidiaries under certain adverse conditions.
additional restrictions on related party transactions, increased capital and liquidity requirements and additional limitations on the use of funds on deposit in bank or brokerage accounts, as well as lower earnings, can reduce the amount of funds available to meet the obligations of the parent company and even require the parent company to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries. also, regulatory action that requires additional liquidity at each of our subsidiaries could impede access to funds we need to pay our obligations or pay dividends. in addition, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary's liquidation or reorganization is subject to prior claims of the subsidiary's creditors.
bank of america bank of america corporation's liquidity and financial condition, and the ability to pay dividends and obligations, could be adversely affected in the event of a resolution.
bank of america corporation, our parent holding company, is required to periodically submit a plan to the fdic and federal reserve describing its resolution strategy under the u.s. bankruptcy code in the event of material financial distress or failure. bank of america corporation's preferred resolution strategy is a "single point of entry" strategy, whereby only the parent holding company would file for bankruptcy under the u.s. bankruptcy code. certain key operating subsidiaries would be provided with sufficient capital and liquidity to operate through severe stress and to enable such subsidiaries to continue operating or be wound down in a solvent manner following a bankruptcy of the parent holding company. bank of america corporation has entered into intercompany arrangements resulting in the contribution of most of its capital and liquidity to key subsidiaries. pursuant to these arrangements, if bank of america corporation's liquidity resources deteriorate so severely that resolution becomes imminent, it will no longer be able to draw liquidity from its key subsidiaries and will be required to contribute its remaining financial assets to a wholly-owned holding company subsidiary. this could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, including the ability to meet our payment obligations and the ability to return capital to shareholders, including through the payment of dividends and repurchase of the corporation's common stock.
if the fdic and federal reserve jointly determine that bank of america corporation's resolution plan is not credible, they could impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth, activities or operations. we could also be required to take certain actions that could impose operating costs and result in the divestiture of assets or restructuring of businesses and subsidiaries.
when a g-sib such as bank of america corporation is in default or danger of default, the fdic may be appointed receiver to conduct an orderly liquidation, and could, among other things, invoke the orderly liquidation authority, instead of the u.s. bankruptcy code, if the secretary of the treasury makes certain financial distress and systemic risk determinations. additionally, the fdic could replace bank of america corporation with a bridge holding company, which could continue operations and result in an orderly resolution of the underlying bank, but whose equity would be held solely for the benefit of our creditors. the fdic's "single point of entry" strategy may result in our security holders suffering greater losses than would have been the case under a bankruptcy proceeding or a different resolution strategy.
if the corporation is resolved under the u.s. bankruptcy code or the fdic's orderly liquidation authority, third-party creditors of the corporation's subsidiaries may receive significant or full recoveries on their claims while security holders of bank of america corporation could face significant or complete losses.
credit economic or market disruptions and insufficient credit loss reserves may result in a higher provision for credit losses.
a number of our products expose us to credit risk, including loans, letters of credit, derivatives, debt securities, trading account assets and assets held-for-sale. deterioration in the financial condition of our consumer and commercial borrowers, counterparties or underlying collateral could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
our credit portfolios may be impacted by u.s. and global macroeconomic and market conditions, events and disruptions, including declines in gdp, consumer spending or property values, asset price corrections, increasing consumer and corporate leverage, increases in corporate bond spreads, government shutdowns, tax changes, rising or elevated unemployment levels, inflation, fluctuations in foreign exchange or interest rates, as well as the emergence or continuation of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, extreme weather events and the impacts of climate change, including acute and/or chronic extreme weather events and efforts to transition to a low-carbon economy. significant economic or market stresses and disruptions typically have a negative impact on the business environment and financial markets, which could impact the underlying credit quality of our borrowers, counterparties and assets. property value declines or asset price corrections could increase the risk of borrowers or counterparties defaulting or becoming delinquent in their obligations to us, and could decrease the value of the collateral we hold, which could increase credit losses. credit risk could also be magnified by lending to leveraged borrowers or declining asset prices, including property or collateral values, unrelated to macroeconomic stress. simultaneous drawdowns on lines of credit and/or an increase in a borrower's leverage in a weakening economic environment, or otherwise, could result in deterioration in our credit portfolio, should borrowers be unable to fulfill competing financial obligations. increased delinquency and default rates could adversely affect our credit portfolios, including consumer credit card, home equity and residential mortgage portfolios through increased charge-offs and provisions for credit losses.
a recessionary environment and/or a rise in unemployment could adversely impact the ability of our consumer and/or commercial borrowers or counterparties to meet their financial obligations and negatively impact our credit portfolio. consumers have been and may continue to be negatively impacted by inflation, resulting in drawdowns of savings or increases in household debt. higher interest rates, which have increased debt servicing costs for some businesses and households, may adversely impact credit quality, particularly in a recessionary environment. certain sectors also remain at risk (e.g., commercial real estate office exposure, consumer discretionary industries) as a result of shifts in demand from the pandemic. globally, conditions of slow growth or recession could further contribute to weaker credit conditions. if the macroeconomic environment worsens, our credit portfolio and allowance for credit losses could be adversely impacted.
we establish an allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, based on management's best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses (ecl) inherent in our relevant financial assets. the process to determine the allowance for credit losses uses models and assumptions that require us to make difficult and complex judgments that are often interrelated, including forecasting how borrowers or counterparties may perform in changing economic conditions. the ability of our borrowers or counterparties to repay their obligations may be impacted by changes in future economic conditions, which in turn could impact the accuracy of our loss forecasts and allowance estimates. there is also the possibility that we have failed or will fail to accurately identify the appropriate economic indicators or accurately estimate their impacts to our borrowers or counterparties, which could impact the accuracy of our loss forecasts and allowance estimates.
if the models, estimates and assumptions we use to establish reserves or the judgments we make in extending credit to our borrowers or counterparties, which are more sensitive bank of america due to the current uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, prove inaccurate in predicting future events, we may suffer losses in excess of our ecl. in addition, changes to external factors can negatively impact our recognition of credit losses in our portfolios and allowance for credit losses.
the allowance for credit losses is our best estimate of ecl; however, there is no guarantee that it will be sufficient to address credit losses, particularly if the economic outlook deteriorates significantly and quickly, or unexpectedly. as circumstances change, we may increase our allowance, which would reduce our earnings. if economic conditions worsen, impacting our consumer and commercial borrowers, counterparties or underlying collateral, and credit losses are worse than expected, we may increase our provision for credit losses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
our concentrations of credit risk could adversely affect our credit losses, results of operations and financial condition.
we may be subject to concentrations of credit risk because of a common characteristic or common sensitivity to economic, financial, public health or business developments. concentrations of credit risk may reside in a particular industry, geography, product, asset class, counterparty or within any pool of exposures with a common risk characteristic. a deterioration in the financial condition or prospects of a particular industry, geographic location, product or asset class, or a failure or downgrade of, or default by, any particular entity or group of entities could negatively affect our businesses, and it is possible our limits and credit monitoring exposure controls will not function as anticipated.
we execute a high volume of transactions and have significant credit concentrations with respect to the financial services industry, predominantly comprised of broker-dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies, mutual funds, hedge funds, ccps and other institutional clients. financial services institutions and other counterparties are inter-related because of trading, funding, clearing or other relationships. defaults by one or more counterparties, or market uncertainty about the financial stability of one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, could lead to market-wide liquidity disruptions, losses, defaults and related disputes and litigation.
our credit risk may also be heightened by market risk when the collateral held by us cannot be liquidated or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivatives exposure due to us, which may occur as a result of events that impact the value of the collateral, such as an asset price correction or fraud. disputes with obligors as to the valuation of collateral could increase in times of significant market stress, volatility or illiquidity, and we could suffer losses during such periods if we are unable to realize the fair value of the collateral or manage declines in the value of collateral.
we have concentrations of credit risk with respect to our consumer real estate and consumer credit card, and our commercial real estate and asset managers and funds portfolios, which represent a significant percentage of our overall credit portfolio. declining home price valuations and demand where we have large concentrations could result in increased servicing advances and expenses, defaults, delinquencies or credit losses. the impacts of earthquakes, as well as climate change, such as rising average global temperatures and sea levels, and the increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters, including droughts, floods, wildfires and hurricanes, could negatively impact collateral, the valuations of home or commercial real estate or our customers' ability and/or willingness to pay fees, outstanding loans or afford new products. this could also cause insurability risk and/or increased insurance costs to customers.
economic weaknesses, sustained elevated inflation, adverse business conditions, market disruptions, adverse economic or market events, rising interest or capitalization rates, declining asset prices, greater volatility in areas where we have concentrated credit risk or deterioration in real estate values or household incomes may cause us to experience a decrease in cash flow and higher credit losses in our portfolios or cause us to write down the value of certain assets. we could also experience continued and long-term negative impacts to our commercial credit exposure and an increase in credit losses within those industries that may be permanently impacted by a change in consumer preferences resulting from covid-19 (e.g., commercial real estate exposure) or other industry disruptions.
we also enter into transactions with sovereign nations, u.s. states and municipalities. unfavorable economic or political conditions (such as those arising from the russia/ukraine conflict), disruptions to capital markets, currency fluctuations, changes in oil prices, social instability and changes in government or monetary policies could adversely impact the operating budgets or credit ratings of these government entities and expose us to credit and liquidity risk.
liquidity disruptions in the financial markets may result in our inability to sell, syndicate or realize the value of our positions, increasing concentrations, which could increase rwa and the credit and market risk associated with our positions.
we may be adversely affected by weaknesses in the u.s. housing market.
u.s. home prices declined and housing demand slowed in the second half of 2022, including in certain markets where we have large concentrations of loans, driven in part by higher mortgage rates, including 30-year fixed-rate mortgages that more than doubled from 2021. this has negatively impacted the demand in some cases and underlying collateral for many of our products. additionally, our mortgage loan production volume is generally influenced by the rate of growth in residential mortgage debt outstanding and the size of the residential mortgage market, both of which have slowed due to rising interest rates and reduced affordability. a deeper downturn in the condition of the u.s. housing market could result in both significant write-downs of asset values in several asset classes, notably mortgage-backed securities (mbs). if the u.s. housing market were to further weaken, the value of real estate could decline, which could result in increased credit losses and delinquent servicing expenses, negatively affect our representations and warranties exposures, and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
our derivatives businesses may expose us to unexpected risks and potential losses.
we are party to a large number of derivatives transactions that may expose us to unexpected market, credit and operational risks that could cause us to suffer unexpected losses. severe declines in asset values or an unanticipated credit event, including unforeseen circumstances that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated and vice versa, may create losses resulting from risks not appropriately taken into account or anticipated in the development, structuring or pricing of a derivative instrument. certain otc derivative contracts and other trading agreements provide that upon the occurrence of certain specified events, such as a change to our or our affiliates' credit ratings, we may be required to provide additional collateral or take other bank of america remedial actions, and we could experience increased difficulty obtaining funding or hedging risks. in some cases our counterparties may have the right to terminate or otherwise diminish our rights under these contracts or agreements.
we are also a member of various ccps, which potentially increases our credit risk exposures to those ccps. in the event that one or more members of a ccp default on their obligations, we may be required to pay a portion of any losses incurred by the ccp as a result of that default. a ccp may also, at its discretion, modify the margin we are required to post, which could mean unexpected and increased funding costs and exposure to that ccp. as a clearing member, we are exposed to the risk of non-performance by our clients for which we clear transactions, which may not be covered by available collateral. additionally, default by a significant market participant may result in further risk and potential losses.
geopolitical we are subject to numerous political, economic, market, reputational, operational, compliance, legal, regulatory and other risks in the jurisdictions in which we operate.
we do business throughout the world, including in emerging markets. economic or geopolitical stress in one or more countries could have a negative impact regionally or globally, resulting in, among other things, market volatility, reduced market value and economic output. our liquidity and credit risk could be adversely impacted by, and our businesses and revenues derived from non-u.s. jurisdictions are subject to, risk of loss from financial, social or judicial instability, economic sanctions, changes in government leadership, including as a result of electoral outcomes or otherwise, changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks, expropriation, nationalization and/or confiscation of assets, price controls, high inflation, natural disasters, the emergence or continuation of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, capital controls, currency re-denomination risk from a country exiting the eu or otherwise, currency fluctuations, foreign exchange controls or movements (caused by devaluation or de-pegging), unfavorable political and diplomatic developments, oil price fluctuations and changes in legislation. these risks are especially elevated in emerging markets.
continued tensions between the u.s. and important trading partners, particularly china, may result in sanctions, further tariff increases or other restrictive actions on cross-border trade, investment, and transfer of information technology that weigh on trade volumes, raise costs for producers, and adversely affect our businesses and revenues, as well as our customers and counterparties, including their credit quality.
slowing growth, recessionary conditions, market volatility and/or political or civil unrest, global supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, wage pressures and elevated inflation in many countries pose additional challenges, including in the form of volatility in financial markets. foreign exchange rates against the u.s. dollar remain an area of uncertainty and potential volatility as the federal reserve and other central banks raise interest rates, and depreciation could increase our financial risks with clients that deal in non-u.s. currencies but have u.s. dollar-denominated debt.
we invest or trade in the securities of corporations and governments located in non-u.s. jurisdictions, including emerging markets. revenues from the trading of non-u.s. securities may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above factors. furthermore, the impact of these fluctuations could be magnified because non-u.s. trading markets, particularly in emerging markets, are generally smaller, less liquid and more volatile than u.s. trading markets. risks in one nation can limit our opportunities for portfolio growth and negatively affect our operations in other nations, including our u.s. operations. market and economic disruptions may affect consumer confidence levels and spending, corporate investment and job creation, bankruptcy rates, levels of incurrence and default on consumer and corporate debt, economic growth rates and asset values, among other factors.
elevated government debt levels raise the risk of volatility, significant valuation changes, political tensions among eu members regarding fiscal policy or defaults on or devaluation of sovereign debt, which could expose us to substantial losses. financial markets have been and may continue to be sensitive to government plans to lower taxes or increase spending.
our non-u.s. businesses are also subject to extensive regulation by governments, securities exchanges and regulators, central banks and other regulatory bodies. in many countries, the laws and regulations applicable to the financial services and securities industries are less predictable, prone to change and uncertainty and evolving, and it may be difficult to determine the requirements of local laws in every market or manage our relationships with multiple regulators in various jurisdictions. significant resources are spent on understanding and monitoring foreign laws, rules and regulations. our inability to remain in compliance with local laws and manage our relationships with regulators could result in increased expenses, changes to our organizational structure and adversely affect our businesses, reputation and results of operations in that market.
we are also subject to complex and extensive u.s. and non-u.s. laws, rules and regulations, which subject us to costs and risks relating to bribery and corruption, anti-money laundering, embargo programs and economic sanctions, which can vary by jurisdiction and require implementation of complex operational capabilities and compliance programs. non-compliance and/or violations could result in an increase in operational and compliance costs, and enforcement actions and civil and criminal penalties against us and individual employees. the increasing speed and novel ways in which funds circulate could make it more challenging to track the movement of funds and heighten financial crimes risk. compliance with these evolving regulatory regimes and legal requirements depends on our ability to improve our processes, controls, surveillance, detection and reporting and analytic capabilities.
in connection with the u.k.'s exit from the eu, we are now subject to different laws and regulations, which are expected to diverge further over time, and are subject to the oversight of additional regulatory authorities. as political and regulatory environments evolve, further changes to the legal and regulatory framework under which our subsidiaries provide products and services in the u.k. and in the eu may result in additional compliance costs and have negative tax consequences or an adverse impact on our results of operations.
in the u.s., the government's debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns have increased the possibility of u.s. government defaults on its debt and/or downgrades to its credit ratings, and prolonged government shutdowns, which could weaken the u.s. dollar, cause market volatility, negatively impact the global economy and banking system and adversely affect our financial condition, including our liquidity. additionally, changes in fiscal, monetary or regulatory policy, including as a result of labor shortages, wage pressures, supply chain disruptions and higher inflation, could increase our compliance costs and adversely affect our business operations, organizational structure and results of operations. monetary policy has contributed to a significant depreciation of many foreign currencies over the past bank of america year. emerging markets are particularly vulnerable to tighter u.s. monetary policy, and many have responded by tightening monetary policy and intervening in foreign exchange markets. further monetary tightening by the federal reserve risks creating additional currency volatility and recessionary conditions in a number of non-u.s. markets.
we are also subject to geopolitical risks, including economic sanctions, acts or threats of international or domestic terrorism, including responses by the u.s. or other governments thereto, increased risk of state-sponsored cyberattacks or campaigns, civil unrest and/or military conflicts, including the escalation of tensions between china and taiwan, which could adversely affect business, market trade and general economic conditions abroad and in the u.s. the russia/ukraine conflict has magnified such risks and resulted in regional instability and adversely impacted commodity and other financial markets, as well as economic conditions, especially in europe where there is significant risk of recession in some countries. the disruption of energy supplies and other goods and sanctions have contributed to inflationary pressures in europe and other regions, which has resulted in greater monetary tightening by policymakers, and could adversely impact the profitability of businesses and our credit risk. military escalation resulting in the involvement of neighboring countries and/or north atlantic treaty organization member countries or new sanctions could result in additional economic disruptions, financial market volatility, and changes to asset valuations, which could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our results of operations.
business operations a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties or the financial services industry, could cause disruptions, adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition, and cause legal or reputational harm.
operational risk exposure exists throughout our organization and as a result of our interactions with, and reliance on, third parties and the financial services industry infrastructure. our operational and security systems infrastructure, including our computer systems, emerging technologies, data management and internal processes and controls, as well as those of third parties, are integral to our performance.
our financial, accounting, data processing and transmission, storage, backup and other operating or security systems and infrastructure, or those of third parties, may be ineffective or fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our or such third party's control, which could adversely affect our ability to process transactions or provide services. prolonged disruptions to our critical business operations and customer services are possible due to computer, telecommunications, network, utility, electronic or physical infrastructure outages, including from abuse or failure of our electronic trading and algorithmic platforms, significant unplanned increases in customer transactions, newly identified vulnerabilities in key hardware and software, failure of aging infrastructure or manual processes, retired or redundant software and/or hardware, technology project implementation challenges and supply chain disruptions. operational disruptions and prolonged operational outages could also result from events arising from natural disasters, including acute and chronic weather events, such as wildfires, tornadoes, hurricanes and floods, some of which are happening with more frequency and severity, and earthquakes, as well as local or larger scale political or social matters, including civil unrest, terrorist acts and military conflict.
we continue to have greater reliance on remote access tools and technology and employees' personal systems (and our third parties' employees' personal systems) and increased data utilization and are increasingly dependent upon our information technology infrastructure to operate our businesses remotely due to the increased number of employees who work from home and evolving customer preferences, including increased reliance on digital banking and other digital services provided by our businesses. effective management of our business continuity increasingly depends on the security, reliability and adequacy of such systems.
we also rely on our employees, representatives and third parties in our day-to-day operations, who may, due to illness, unavailability, human error, misconduct (including errors in judgment, malice, fraudulent or illegal activity), malfeasance or a failure or breach of systems or infrastructure cause disruptions to our organization and expose us to operational losses, regulatory risk and reputational harm. our and our third parties' inability to properly introduce, deploy and manage changes to internal financial and governance processes, existing products, services and technology, and new product innovations and technology could also result in additional operational and regulatory risk.
regardless of the measures we have taken to implement training, procedures, backup systems and other safeguards to support our operations and bolster our operational resilience, our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by significant disruptions to us or to third parties with whom we interact or upon whom we rely, including systemic cyber events that result in system outages and unavailability of part or all of the internet, cloud services and/or the financial services industry infrastructure (including electronic trading platforms and critical banking activities). our ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to third-party systems and the financial services industry infrastructure is more limited than with our own systems.
any backup systems may not process data as quickly as our primary systems and some data might not have been backed up. we regularly update the systems we rely on to support our operations and growth and to remain compliant with all applicable laws, rules and regulations globally. this updating entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones, including business interruptions.
a failure or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure resulting in disruption to our critical business operations and customer services and/or failure to identify, effectively respond to operational risks in a timely manner, and continue to deliver our services through an operational disruption could expose us to a number of risks, including market abuse, regulatory, market, privacy and liquidity risk, and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition, and cause legal or reputational harm.
a cyberattack, information or security breach, or a technology failure of ours or of a third party could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business, result in the misuse or disclosure of information, result in additional costs, damage to our reputation, increase our regulatory and legal risks and cause financial losses.
our business is highly dependent on the security, controls and efficacy of our infrastructure, computer and data management systems, and those of our customers, suppliers, counterparties and other third parties, the financial services bank of america industry and financial data aggregators, with whom we interact, on whom we rely or who have access to our customers' personal or account information. we rely on effective access management and the secure collection, processing, transmission, storage and retrieval of confidential, proprietary, personally identifiable and other information in our and our third parties' computer and data management systems and networks.
our cybersecurity risk and exposure remains heightened because of, among other things, our prominent size and scale, high-profile brand, geographic footprint and international presence and role in the financial services industry and the broader economy. the proliferation of third-party financial data aggregators and emerging technologies, including our use of automation, artificial intelligence (ai) and robotics, increase our cybersecurity risks and exposure.
we, our employees, customers, regulators and third parties are regularly the target of an increasing number of cyber threats and attacks. cyber threats and techniques used in cyberattacks are pervasive, sophisticated and difficult to prevent, including computer viruses, malicious or destructive code (such as ransomware), social engineering (including phishing, vishing and smishing), denial of service or information or other security breach tactics that could result in disruptions to our businesses and operations, the loss of our funds and/or our clients' and the unauthorized disclosure, release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction or theft of confidential, proprietary and other information, including intellectual property, of ours, our employees, our customers or of third parties. cyberattacks may be carried out on a worldwide scale and by a growing number of cyber actors, including organized crime groups, hackers, terrorist organizations, extremist parties, hostile foreign governments, state-sponsored actors, activists, disgruntled employees and other third parties, including those involved in corporate espionage.
cyber threats and the techniques used in cyberattacks change, develop and evolve rapidly, including from emerging technologies, such as advanced forms of ai and quantum computing. despite substantial efforts to protect the integrity and resilience of our systems and implement controls, processes, policies, employee training and other protective measures, we may not be able to anticipate or detect cyberattacks or information or security breaches and/or develop or implement effective preventive or defensive measures to address or mitigate such attacks or breaches. internal access management failures could result in the compromise or unauthorized exposure of confidential data. additionally, the failure of our employees to exercise sound judgment and vigilance when targeted with social engineering cyberattacks may increase our vulnerability.
our risk and exposure to cyberattacks and security breaches continue to increase due to the acceptance and use of digital banking products and services, including mobile banking products, and reliance on remote access tools and technology, which have increased our reliance on virtual/digital interactions and a larger number of access points to our networks that must be secured. this increased risk of unauthorized access to our networks results in greater amounts of information being available for access. employees working remotely away from the office (whether on personal or our devices) also represent inherently greater risk than employees working in our offices. greater demand on our information technology infrastructure and security tools and processes will likely continue.
we also face indirect technology, cybersecurity and operational risks relating to the customers, clients and other third parties with whom we do business and the financial services industry, upon whom we rely to facilitate or enable our business activities or upon whom our customers rely. other indirect risks relate to providers of products and/or services, financial counterparties, financial data aggregators, financial intermediaries, such as clearing agents, exchanges and clearing houses, regulators, providers of critical infrastructure, such as internet access and electrical power, and retailers for whom we process transactions. we are also at additional risk resulting from critical third-party information security and open-source software vulnerabilities.
we have exposure to cyber threats due to our continuous transmission of sensitive information to, and storage of such information by, third parties, including providers of products and/or services, and regulators, the outsourcing of some of our business operations, and system and customer account updates and conversions. further, any such event may not be disclosed to us in a timely manner. any failure, cyberattack or other information or security breach that significantly degrades, deletes or compromises our systems or data could adversely impact third parties, counterparties and the critical infrastructure of the financial services industry.
due to increasing consolidation, interdependence and complexity of financial entities and technology systems, a technology failure, cyberattack or other information or security vulnerability, failure or breach that significantly exposes, degrades, deletes or compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities or third parties could adversely impact us and increase the risk of operational failure, as disparate systems need to be integrated, often on an accelerated basis.
cyberattacks or security breaches could persist for an extended period of time before being detected and take additional time to determine the scope, extent, amount, and type of information compromised, following which the impact and measures to recover and restore to a business-as-usual state may be difficult to assess. we continue to expend significant additional money and resources to modify or enhance our protective measures, investigate and remediate any information security, software or network vulnerabilities or incidents whether specific to us, a third party, the industry or businesses in general, and develop our capabilities to respond and recover.
while we have experienced cyberattacks and security breaches, and expect to continue to, we have not experienced any material losses or other material consequences relating to technology failure, cyberattacks or other information or security breaches, whether directed at us or third parties. there can be no assurance that our controls and procedures in place to monitor and mitigate the risks of cyber threats, including the remediation of critical information security and software vulnerabilities, will be sufficient and/or timely and that we will not suffer material losses or consequences in the future. successful penetration or circumvention of system security could result in negative consequences, including loss of customers and business opportunities, the withdrawal of customer deposits, misappropriation or destruction of our intellectual property, proprietary information or confidential information and/or the confidential, proprietary or personally identifiable information of certain parties, such as our employees, customers, providers of products and services, counterparties and other third parties, or damage to their computers or systems. any future technology failure, cyberattack or breach could adversely affect our ability to conduct day-to-day business activities, effect transactions, service our clients, manage our exposure to risk or expand our bank of america businesses, result in fraudulent or unauthorized transactions or cause prolonged computer and network outages resulting in material disruptions to our or our customers' or other third parties' network access or critical business operations and customer services, in the u.s. and/or globally.
any cyberattack or breach, whether directed at us or third parties, may result in significant lost revenue, give rise to losses and claims brought by third parties, litigation exposure, regulatory sanctions, enforcement actions, government fines, penalties or intervention and other negative consequences. the actual or perceived success of a cyberattack on our systems may damage our reputation with customers and third parties with whom we do business and/or result in the loss of confidence in our security measures. additionally, our failure to disclose or communicate cyber incidents appropriately to relevant parties could result in regulatory, privacy, operational and reputational risk. although we maintain cyber insurance, there can be no assurance that liabilities or losses we may incur will be covered under such policies or that the amount of insurance will be adequate. cyberattacks or other information or security breaches could also result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, additional compliance costs, and our internal controls or disclosure controls being rendered ineffective. the occurrence of any of these events could adversely impact our businesses, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.
failure to satisfy our obligations as servicer for residential mortgage securitizations, loans owned by other entities and other related losses could adversely impact our reputation, servicing costs or results of operations.
we and our legacy companies service mortgage loans on behalf of third-party securitization vehicles and other investors. if we commit a material breach of our obligations as servicer or master servicer, we may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period of time following notice, which could cause us to lose servicing income. we may also have liability for any failure by us, as a servicer or master servicer, for any act or omission on our part that involves willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of our duties. if any such breach was found to have occurred, it may harm our reputation, increase our servicing costs or losses due to potential indemnification obligations, result in litigation or regulatory action or adversely impact our results of operations. additionally, foreclosures may result in costs, litigation or losses due to irregularities in the underlying documentation, or if the validity of a foreclosure action is challenged by a borrower or overturned by a court because of errors or deficiencies in the foreclosure process. we may also incur costs or losses relating to delays or alleged deficiencies in processing documents necessary to comply with state law governing foreclosure.
changes in the structure of and relationship among the gses could adversely impact our business.
we rely on the gses to guarantee or purchase mortgage loans that meet their conforming loan requirements. during 2022, we sold approximately $4.1 billion of loans to gses, primarily freddie mac (fhlmc). fhlmc and fannie mae (fnma) are currently in conservatorship, with the federal housing finance agency (fhfa) acting as conservator. in 2019, the treasury department published a proposal to recapitalize fhlmc and fnma and remove them from conservatorship and reduce their role in the marketplace. in january 2021, the treasury department further amended the agreement that governs the conservatorship of fhlmc and fnma and delineated the continued objective to remove the gses from conservatorship. however, we cannot predict the future prospects of the gses, timing of the recapitalization or release from conservatorship, or content of legislative or rulemaking proposals regarding the future status of the gses in the housing market. if the gses take a reduced role in the marketplace, including by limiting the mortgage products they offer, we could be required to seek alternative funding sources, retain additional loans on our balance sheet, secure funding through the federal home loan bank system, or securitize the loans through private label securitization, which could increase our cost of funds related to the origination of new mortgage loans, increase credit risk and/or impact our capacity to originate new mortgage loans. uncertainty regarding their future and the mbs they guarantee continues to exist for the foreseeable future. these developments could adversely affect our securities portfolios, capital levels, liquidity and results of operations.
our risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and reducing the potential for losses.
our risk management framework is designed to minimize risk and loss to us. we seek to effectively and consistently identify, measure, monitor, report and control the key types of risk to which we are subject, including strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. additionally, risks may span across multiple key risk types, including climate risk and legal risk. while we employ a broad and diversified set of controls and risk mitigation techniques, including modeling and forecasting, hedging strategies and techniques that seek to balance our ability to profit from trading positions with our exposure to potential losses, our ability to control and mitigate risks that result in losses is inherently limited by our ability to identify and measure all risks, including emerging and unknown risks, anticipate the timing and impact of risks, apply effective hedging strategies, make correct assumptions, manage and aggregate data correctly and efficiently, identify changes in markets or client behaviors not yet inherent in historical data and develop risk management models and forecasts to assess and control risk.
our ability to manage risk is dependent on our ability to consistently execute all elements of our risk management program and develop and maintain a culture of managing risk well throughout the corporation and manage risks associated with third parties, including providers of products and/or services, enable effective risk management and help confirm that risks are appropriately considered, evaluated and responded to in a timely manner. uncertain economic and geopolitical conditions, heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny of and change within the financial services industry, the pace of technological changes, accounting and market developments, the failure of employees, representatives and third parties to comply with our policies and risk framework and the overall complexity of our operations, among other developments, have in the past and may in the future result in a heightened level of risk. for example, we have experienced increased operational, reputational and compliance risk as a result of the prior need to rapidly deploy and implement multiple and varying pandemic relief programs, including the processing of unemployment benefits for california and certain other states, which have resulted in and will continue to result in losses. our failure to manage evolving risks or properly anticipate, manage, control or mitigate risks could result in additional losses.
bank of america regulatory, compliance and legal we are subject to evolving government legislation and regulations and certain settlements, orders and agreements with government authorities from time to time.
we are subject to evolving and comprehensive regulation under federal and state laws in the u.s. and the laws of the various jurisdictions in which we operate, including increasing and complex regulatory sanctions regimes. these laws and regulations significantly affect and have the potential to restrict the scope of our existing businesses, limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities, including the products and services we offer, reduce certain fees and rates or make our products and services more expensive for our clients. we are also required to file various financial and non-financial regulatory reports to comply with laws, rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate.
we continue to adjust our business and operations, legal entity structure, disclosure and policies, processes, procedures and controls, including with regard to capital and liquidity management, risk management and data management, to comply with laws, rules and regulations, as well as guidance and interpretation by regulatory authorities, including the department of treasury (including the internal revenue service (irs)), federal reserve, occ, cfpb, financial stability oversight council, fdic, department of labor, sec and cftc in the u.s., foreign regulators, other government authorities and self-regulatory organizations. further, we could become subject to future laws, rules and regulations beyond those currently proposed, adopted or contemplated in the u.s. or abroad, including policies and rulemaking related to emerging technologies, cybersecurity and data, and climate risk management and esg governance and reporting, including emissions and sustainability disclosure. the cumulative effect of all of the current and possible future legislation and regulations on our litigation and regulatory exposure, businesses, operations and profitability remains uncertain and necessitates that we make certain assumptions with respect to the scope and requirements of prospective and proposed laws, rules and regulations in our business planning. if these assumptions prove incorrect, we could be subject to increased regulatory, legal and compliance risks and costs as well as potential reputational harm. also, u.s. and regulatory initiatives abroad may overlap, and non-u.s. regulation and initiatives may be inconsistent or may conflict with current or proposed u.s. regulations, which could lead to compliance risks and increased costs.
our regulators' prudential and supervisory authority gives them broad power and discretion to direct our actions, and they have assumed an active oversight, inspection and investigatory role across the financial services industry. regulatory focus is not limited to laws, rules and regulations applicable to the financial services industry, but includes other significant laws, rules and regulations that apply across industries and jurisdictions, including those related to anti-money laundering, anti-bribery, anti-corruption and regulatory sanctions.
we are also subject to laws, rules and regulations in the u.s. and abroad, including the gdpr and ccpa as modified by the cpra, and a number of additional jurisdictions enacting or considering similar laws, regarding privacy and the disclosure, collection, use, sharing and safeguarding of personally identifiable information, including our employees, customers, suppliers, counterparties and other third parties, the violation of which could result in litigation, regulatory fines, enforcement actions and operational loss. the complexity and risk of compliance has been magnified by the collection of employee health and/or other information in response to the pandemic. additionally, we will likely be subject to new and evolving data privacy laws in the u.s. and abroad, which could result in additional costs of compliance, litigation, regulatory fines and enforcement actions. there remains complexity and uncertainty, including potential suspension or prohibition, regarding data transfer because of concerns over compliance with laws, rules and regulations for cross-border flows and transfers of personal data from the european economic area (eea) to the u.s. and other jurisdictions outside of the eea, resulting from judicial and regulatory guidance. to the extent that a new eu-u.s. data privacy framework leads to a relaxation of applicable legislation and regulations, regardless of transfer mechanism, challenges are expected from consumer advocacy groups. other jurisdictions, including china, russia and india, have commenced consultation efforts or enacted new legislation or regulations to establish standards for personal data transfers. if cross-border personal data transfers are suspended or restricted or we are required to implement distinct processes for each jurisdiction's standards, this could result in operational disruptions to our businesses, additional costs, increased enforcement activity, new contract negotiations with third parties, and/or modification of such data management.
as part of their enforcement authority, our regulators and other government authorities have the authority to, among other things, conduct investigations and assess significant civil or criminal monetary fines, penalties or restitution, issue cease and desist orders, initiate injunctive action, apply regulatory sanctions or enter into consent orders. the amounts paid by us and other financial institutions to settle proceedings or investigations have, in some instances, been substantial and may increase. in some cases, governmental authorities have required criminal pleas or other extraordinary terms as part of such resolutions, which could have significant consequences, including reputational harm, loss of customers, restrictions on the ability to access capital markets, and the inability to operate certain businesses or offer certain products. our response to regulators and other government authorities may be time-consuming, be expensive and divert management attention from our business. the outcome of any matter, which may last years, may be difficult to predict or estimate.
additionally, the terms of settlements, orders and agreements that we have entered into with government entities and regulatory authorities have imposed, or could impose, significant operational and compliance costs on us with respect to enhancements to our procedures and controls, losses with respect to fraudulent transactions perpetrated against our customers, expansion of our risk and control functions within our lines of business, investment in technology and the hiring of significant numbers of additional risk, control and compliance personnel. if we fail to meet the requirements of the regulatory settlements, orders or agreements to which we are subject, or, more generally, fail to maintain risk and control procedures and processes that meet the heightened standards established by our regulators and other government authorities, we could be required to enter into further settlements, orders or agreements and pay additional fines, penalties or judgments, or accept material regulatory restrictions on our businesses.
improper actions, behaviors or practices by us, our employees or representatives that are illegal, unethical or contrary to our core values could harm us, our shareholders or customers or damage the integrity of the financial markets, and are subject to regulatory scrutiny across jurisdictions. the complexity of the regulatory and enforcement regimes in the bank of america u.s., coupled with the global scope of our operations and the regulatory environment worldwide, also means that a single event or practice or a series of related events or practices may give rise to a significant number of overlapping investigations and regulatory proceedings, either by multiple federal and state agencies in the u.s. or by multiple regulators and other governmental entities in different jurisdictions. actions by other members of the financial services industry related to business activities in which we participate may result in investigations by regulators or other government authorities.
while we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs, compliance risks will continue to exist, particularly as we anticipate and adapt to new and evolving laws, rules and regulations. we also rely upon third parties who may expose us to compliance and legal risk. future legislative or regulatory actions, and any required changes to our business or operations, or those of third parties upon whom we rely, resulting from such developments and actions could result in a significant loss of revenue, impose additional compliance and other costs or otherwise reduce our profitability, limit the products and services that we offer or our ability to pursue certain business opportunities, require us to dispose of certain businesses or assets, require us to curtail certain businesses, affect the value of assets that we hold, require us to increase our prices and therefore reduce demand for our products, or otherwise adversely affect our businesses.
we are subject to risks from potential liability arising from lawsuits and regulatory and government action.
we face significant legal risks in our business, with a high volume of claims against us and other financial institutions. the amount of damages, penalties and fines that litigants and regulators seek from us and other financial institutions continues to be significant. this includes disputes with consumers, customers and other counterparties.
financial institutions, including us, continue to be the subject of claims alleging anti-competitive conduct with respect to various products and markets, including u.s. antitrust class actions claiming joint and several liability for treble damages. as disclosed in note 12 - commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements, we also face contractual indemnification and loan-repurchase claims arising from alleged breaches of representations and warranties in the sale of residential mortgages by legacy companies, which may result in a requirement that we repurchase the mortgage loans, or make whole or provide other remedies to counterparties.
u.s. regulators and government agencies regularly pursue enforcement claims against financial institutions including the corporation for alleged violations of law and customer harm under the financial institutions reform, recovery, and enforcement act, the federal securities laws, the false claims act, fair lending laws and regulations (including the equal credit opportunity act and the fair housing act), antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws and regulations related to products and services such as overdraft and sales practices, including prohibitions on unfair, deceptive, and/or abusive acts and practices under the consumer financial protection act and the federal trade commission act. such claims may carry significant penalties, restitution and, in certain cases, treble damages, and the ultimate resolution of regulatory inquiries, investigations and other proceedings to which we are subject from time-to-time is difficult to predict.
there is also an increased focus on compliance with u.s. and global laws, rules and regulations related to the collection, use, sharing and safeguarding of personally identifiable information and corporate data, as well as the implementation, use and management of emerging technologies, including ai and machine learning. additionally, misconduct by our employees and representatives, including unethical, fraudulent, improper or illegal conduct, unfair, deceptive, abusive or discriminatory business practices, or violations of policies, procedures, laws, rules or regulations, including conduct that affects compliance with books and records requirements, can result in litigation and/or government investigations and enforcement actions, and cause significant reputational harm. we are also subject to litigation and regulatory and government actions regarding fraud perpetrated against our customers in connection with the use of our products and services and increased scrutiny of sustainability-related policies, goals, targets and disclosure, which could result in litigation, regulatory investigations and actions and reputational harm.
the global environment of extensive investigations, regulation, regulatory compliance burdens, litigation and regulatory enforcement, combined with uncertainty related to the continually evolving regulatory environment, have affected and will likely continue to affect operational and compliance costs and risks, including the limitation or cessation of our ability or feasibility to continue providing certain products and services. lawsuits and regulatory actions have resulted in and will likely continue to result in judgments, orders, settlements, penalties and fines adverse to us. further, we entered into orders with government authorities regarding our participation in implementing government relief measures related to the pandemic and other federal and state government assistance programs, including the processing of unemployment benefits for california and certain other states, and continue to be involved in related litigation which may result in judgments and/or settlements. litigation and investigation costs, substantial legal liability or significant regulatory or government action against us could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, including liquidity, and results of operations, and/or cause significant reputational harm.
u.s. federal banking agencies may require us to increase our regulatory capital, total loss-absorbing capacity (tlac), long-term debt or liquidity requirements.
we are subject to u.s. regulatory capital and liquidity rules. these rules, among other things, establish minimum requirements to qualify as a well-capitalized institution. if any of our subsidiary insured depository institutions fail to maintain their status as well capitalized under the applicable regulatory capital rules, the federal reserve will require us to agree to bring the insured depository institution back to well-capitalized status. for the duration of such an agreement, the federal reserve may impose restrictions on our activities. if we were to fail to enter into or comply with such an agreement, the federal reserve may impose more severe restrictions on our activities, including requiring us to cease and desist activities permitted under the bank holding company act of 1956.
capital and liquidity requirements are frequently introduced and amended. it is possible that regulators may increase regulatory capital requirements including tlac and long-term debt requirements, change how regulatory capital or rwa is calculated or increase liquidity requirements. our ability to return capital to our shareholders depends in part on our ability to maintain regulatory capital levels above minimum requirements plus buffers. to the extent that increases occur in our scb, g-sib surcharge or countercyclical capital buffer, our returns of capital to shareholders, including common stock dividends and common stock repurchases, could decrease. for example, our g-sib surcharge is expected to increase by 50 bps to 3.0 percent on january 1, 2024. the federal reserve could bank of america also limit or prohibit capital actions, such as paying or increasing dividends or repurchasing common stock, as a result of economic disruptions or events.
as part of its ccar, the federal reserve conducts stress testing on parts of our business using hypothetical economic scenarios prepared by the federal reserve. those scenarios may affect our ccar stress test results, which may impact the level of our scb, requiring us to hold additional capital. for example, based on ccar 2022 stress test results, our scb increased 90 bps to 3.4 percent on october 1, 2022.
a significant component of regulatory capital ratios is calculating our rwa and our leverage exposure, which may increase. the basel committee on banking supervision has also revised several key methodologies for measuring rwa that have not yet been implemented in the u.s., including a standardized approach for operational risk, revised market risk requirements and constraints on the use of internal models, as well as a capital floor based on the revised standardized approaches. it is expected in 2023 that u.s. banking regulators will propose updates to the u.s. capital framework to incorporate the basel committee revisions. economic disruptions or events may also cause an increase in our balance sheet, rwa or leverage exposures, increasing required regulatory capital and liquidity amounts.
changes to and compliance with the regulatory capital and liquidity requirements may impact our operations by requiring us to liquidate assets, increase borrowings, issue additional equity or other securities, reduce the amount of common stock repurchases or dividends, cease or alter certain operations and business activities or hold highly liquid assets, which may adversely affect our results of operations.
changes in accounting standards or assumptions in applying accounting policies could adversely affect us.
accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported value of our assets or liabilities and results of operations and are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. if assumptions, estimates or judgments were erroneously applied, we could be required to correct and restate prior-period financial statements. accounting standard-setters and those who interpret the accounting standards, including the sec, banking regulators and our independent registered public accounting firm may also amend or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how various standards should be applied. these changes may be difficult to predict and could impact the preparation and reporting of our financial statements, including the application of new or revised standards retrospectively, resulting in revisions to prior-period financial statements.
we may be adversely affected by changes in u.s. and non-u.s. tax laws and regulations.
it is possible that governmental authorities in the u.s. and/or other countries could further change tax laws in a way that would materially adversely affect us, including changes to the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 and inflation reduction act of 2022. new guidelines issued by the organization for economic cooperation and development could adversely impact how the global profits of multinational enterprises are taxed. any change in tax laws and regulations or interpretations of current or future tax laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax liabilities and results of operations. u.s. and foreign tax laws are complex and our judgments, interpretations or applications of such tax laws could differ from that of the relevant governmental authority. this could result in additional tax liabilities and interest, penalties, the reduction of certain tax benefits and/or the requirement to make adjustments to amounts recorded, which could be material.
additionally, we have u.k. net deferred tax assets (dta) which consist primarily of net operating losses that are expected to be realized by certain subsidiaries over an extended number of years. adverse developments with respect to tax laws or to other material factors, such as prolonged worsening of europe's capital markets or changes in the ability of our u.k. subsidiaries to conduct business in the eu, could lead our management to reassess and/or change its current conclusion that no valuation allowance is necessary with respect to our u.k. net dta.
reputation damage to our reputation could harm our businesses, including our competitive position and business prospects.
our ability to attract and retain customers, clients, investors and employees is impacted by our reputation. harm to our reputation can arise from various sources, including actual or perceived activities of our officers, directors, employees, contractors, third parties, clients, counterparties and other representatives, such as fraud, misconduct and unethical behavior (such as employees' sales practices), adequacy of our responsiveness to fraud claims perpetrated against our customers, effectiveness of our internal controls, litigation or regulatory matters and their outcomes, compensation practices, lending practices, suitability or reasonableness of particular trading or investment strategies, including the reliability of our research and models, and prohibiting clients from engaging in certain transactions.
our reputation may also be harmed by actual or perceived failure to deliver the products and standards of service and quality expected by our customers, clients and the community, including the overstatement or mislabeling of the environmental benefits of our products, services or transactions, failure to recognize and address customer complaints, compliance failures, inability to implement or manage emerging technologies, including quantum computing, ai, machine learning and technology change, failure to maintain effective data management, security breaches, cyber incidents, prolonged or repeated system outages, unintended disclosure of personal, proprietary or confidential information, breach of fiduciary obligations and handling of the emergence or continuation of health emergencies or pandemics. for example, we entered into orders with certain government agencies regarding our processing of unemployment benefits for california and certain other states, and continue to be involved in related litigation, which may result in judgments and/or settlements. our reputation may also be negatively impacted by our esg practices and disclosures, and those of our customers and third parties.
actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members or individuals in the industry also can adversely affect our reputation. also, adverse publicity or negative information posted on social media by employees, the media or otherwise, whether or not factually correct, may adversely impact our business prospects or financial results.
we are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations regarding fair lending activity, udaap, electronic funds transfers, know-your-customer requirements, data protection and privacy, including the gdpr, ccpa as modified by the cpra, cross-border data movement, cybersecurity and other matters, as well as evolving and expansive interpretations of these laws and bank of america regulations. principles concerning the appropriate scope of consumer and commercial privacy vary considerably in different jurisdictions, and regulatory and public expectations regarding the definition and scope of consumer and commercial privacy may remain fluid. these laws may be interpreted and applied by various jurisdictions in a manner inconsistent with our current or future practices, or with one another. if personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers in our possession, or in the possession of third parties or financial data aggregators, is mishandled, misused or mismanaged, or if we do not timely or adequately address such information, we may face regulatory, legal and operational risks, which could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.
we could suffer reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest. management of potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions, obligations and interests with and among our clients. the actual or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to use our products and services, or result in litigation or enforcement actions, which could adversely affect our business.
our actual or perceived failure to address these and other issues, such as operational risks, gives rise to reputational risk that could harm us and our business prospects. failure to appropriately address any of these issues could also give rise to additional regulatory restrictions, legal risks and reputational harm, which could, among other consequences, increase the size and number of litigation claims and damages asserted or subject us to enforcement actions, fines and penalties, and cause us to incur related costs and expenses.
other the impacts of the pandemic have adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect us.
the covid-19 pandemic has directly and indirectly negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, adversely affected equity market valuations, created significant volatility and disruption in financial and capital markets, resulted in challenging labor market conditions, and adversely impacted our financial results to varying degrees and in various respects. the future direct and indirect effects of the pandemic on global health and economic conditions and activity remain uncertain, continue to evolve by region, country and state and depend on future developments that cannot be predicted, including impacts from the expiration of the federal covid-19 public health emergency, surges of covid-19 cases and the spread of more dangerous variants of covid-19, the availability, usage and acceptance of effective medical treatments and vaccines, changing client preferences and behavior and future public response and government actions, including travel bans and restrictions, and limitations on business. such evolving impacts of the pandemic could disrupt the u.s. and global economy, including changes in financial and capital markets, and adversely affect our businesses and operations, liquidity, results of operations and financial condition, including from increased allowance for credit losses and noninterest expenses, which are dependent on the pandemic's duration and severity.
reforms to and replacement of ibors and certain other rates or indices may adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.
though significant progress has been made in the global financial markets to replace products and contracts referencing london interbank offered rate (libor) or other ibors (ibor products), the aggregate notional amount of these ibor products remains material to our business. risks and challenges associated with the transition from ibors remain and may result in consequences that cannot be fully anticipated, which expose us to various financial, operational, supervisory, conduct and legal risk.
while there has been significant progress in market and client adoption of arrs, usage of arrs may vary across or within categories of contracts, products and services, potentially resulting in market fragmentation, decreased trading volumes and liquidity, increased complexity and modeling and operational risks. arrs have compositions and characteristics that differ from the benchmarks they replace, in some cases they have limited liquidity, and may demonstrate less predictable performance over time than the benchmarks they replace. for example, certain arrs are calculated on a compounded or weighted-average basis and, unlike ibors, do not reflect bank credit risk and therefore typically require a spread adjustment. there are important differences between the fallbacks, triggers and calculation methodologies being implemented in cash and derivatives markets. any mismatch between the adoption of arrs in loans, securities and derivatives markets may impact hedging or other financial arrangements we have implemented, and we may experience unanticipated market exposures. changes resulting from transition to successor or alternative rates may adversely affect the yield on loans or securities held by us, amounts paid on securities we have issued, amounts received and paid on derivatives we have entered into, the value of such loans, securities or derivative instruments, the trading market for such products and contracts, and our ability to effectively use hedging instruments to manage risk. there can be no assurance that existing assets and liabilities based on or linked to ibors that have not already transitioned to arrs will transition without delay or potential disputes.
although a significant majority of the aggregate notional amount of our remaining ibor products maturing after 2022 include or have been amended to include fallbacks to arrs, the transitioning of certain ibor products that do not include fallback provisions or adequate fallback mechanisms require additional efforts to modify their terms. some outstanding ibor products are particularly challenging to modify due to the requirement that all impacted parties consent to such modification. to address outstanding ibor products that are difficult to modify, legislation has been adopted in the u.s. and in other jurisdictions. litigation, disputes or other action may occur as a result of the interpretation or application of legislation or regulations, including if there is an overlap between laws or regulations in different jurisdictions or from interactions with any fca-compelled "synthetic" libor settings.
some of our ibor products may contain language giving the calculation agent (which may be us) discretion to determine the successor rate (including the applicable spread adjustment) to the existing benchmark. we may face a risk of litigation, disputes or other actions from clients, counterparties, customers, investors or others based on various claims, for example, that we incorrectly interpreted or enforced ibor-based contract provisions, failed to appropriately communicate the effect that the transition to arrs will have on existing and future products, treated affected parties unfairly or made inappropriate product recommendations to or investments on behalf of its clients, or engaged in anti-competitive behavior or unlawfully manipulated markets or benchmarks.
arr-based products that we develop, launch and/or support, including products using credit sensitive rates, may perform differently to ibor products during times of economic stress, bank of america adverse or volatile market conditions and across the credit and economic cycle, which may impact the value, return on and profitability of our arr-based assets. new financial products linked to arrs may have additional legal, financial, tax, operational, market, compliance, reputational, competitive or other risks to us, our clients and other market participants. banking regulators in the u.s. and globally have maintained heightened regulatory scrutiny and intensified supervisory focus on financial institution libor transition plans, preparations and readiness, including our use of credit-sensitive rates like the bloomberg short-term bank yield index and arr-based term rates, which could result in regulatory action, litigation and/or the need to change the products offered by our businesses. failure to meet industry-wide ibor transition milestones and to cease issuance of ibor products by relevant cessation dates may, subject to certain regulatory exceptions, result in supervisory enforcement by applicable regulators, increase our cost of, and access to, capital or lead to other consequences.
the ongoing market transition has altered, and additional developments may further alter, some aspects of our risk profile and risk management strategies, including derivatives and hedging strategies, modeling and analytics, valuation tools, product design and systems, controls, procedures and operational infrastructure. further changes may increase costs and expose us to potential risks related to regulatory compliance, requirements or inquiries. among other risks, various ibor products transition to arrs at different times or in different manners, with the result that we may face unexpected interest rate, pricing or other exposures across business or product lines, and we may face operational risks related to planned processes at certain ccps to convert outstanding usd libor-cleared derivatives to arr positions. continuing reforms to market transition and other factors may adversely affect our business, including the ability to serve customers and maintain market share, financial condition or results of operations and could result in reputational harm to us.
we face significant and increasing competition in the financial services industry.
we operate in a highly competitive environment and experience intense competition from local and global financial institutions and new entrants in domestic and foreign markets. we compete on the basis of a number of factors, including customer service and convenience, the pricing, quality and range of products and services we offer, lending limits, the quality and delivery of our technology and our reputation, experience and relationships in relevant markets. there is increasing pressure to provide products and services on more attractive terms, including lower fees and higher interest rates on deposits, and lower cost investment strategies, which may impact our ability to effectively compete. the changing regulatory environment may also create competitive disadvantages, including from different regulatory requirements.
emerging technologies and the growth of e-commerce have lowered geographic and monetary barriers of other financial institutions, made it easier for non-depository institutions to offer traditional banking products and services and allowed non-traditional financial service providers and technology companies to compete with traditional financial service companies in providing electronic and internet-based financial solutions and services, including electronic securities trading with low or no fees and commissions, marketplace lending, financial data aggregation and payment processing services, including real-time payment platforms. further, clients may choose to conduct business with other market participants who engage in business or offer products in areas we deem speculative or risky as an alternative to traditional banking products. increased competition may reduce our net interest margin and revenues from our fee-based products and services and negatively affect our earnings, including by pressuring us to lower pricing or credit standards, requiring additional investment to improve the quality and delivery of our technology, reducing our market share and/or affecting the willingness of our clients to do business with us.
our inability to adapt our business strategies, products and services could harm our business.
we rely on a diversified mix of businesses that deliver a broad range of financial products and services through multiple distribution channels. our success depends on our and our third-party providers' of products and services abilities to adapt our business strategies, products and services and their respective features in a timely manner, including available payment processing services and technology to rapidly evolving industry standards and consumer preferences.
the widespread adoption and rapid evolution of emerging technologies, including analytic capabilities, self-service digital trading platforms and automated trading markets, internet services, and digital assets, such as central bank digital currencies, cryptocurrencies (including stablecoins), tokens and other cryptoassets that utilize distributed ledger technology (dlt), as well as dlt in payment, clearing and settlement processes creates additional risks, could negatively impact our ability to compete and require substantial expenditures to the extent we were to modify or adapt our existing products and services. as such new technologies evolve and mature, our businesses and results of operations could be adversely impacted, including as a result of the introduction of new competitors to the payment ecosystem and increased volatility in deposits and/or significant long-term reduction in deposits (i.e., financial disintermediation). also, we may not be as timely or successful in developing or introducing new products and services, integrating new products or services into our existing offerings, responding, managing or adapting to changes in consumer behavior, preferences, spending, investing and/or saving habits, achieving market acceptance of our products and services, reducing costs in response to pressures to deliver products and services at lower prices or sufficiently developing and maintaining loyal customers. the corporation's, or its third-party providers', inability or resistance to timely innovate or adapt its operations, products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences could result in service disruptions and harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations and reputation.
we could suffer operational, reputational and financial harm if our models fail to properly anticipate and manage risk.
we use models extensively to forecast losses, project revenue and expenses, assess and control our operations and financial condition, assist in capital planning and measure, forecast and assess capital and liquidity requirements for credit, market, operational and strategic risks. under our enterprise model risk policy, model risk management is required to perform model oversight, including independent validation before initial use, ongoing monitoring reviews through outcomes analysis and benchmarking, and periodic revalidation. however, models are subject to inherent limitations from simplifying assumptions, uncertainty regarding economic and financial outcomes, and emerging risks from applications that rely on ai.
our models may not be sufficiently predictive of future results due to limited historical patterns, extreme or unanticipated market movements or customer behavior and liquidity, especially during severe market downturns or stress events (e.g., geopolitical or pandemic events), which could limit bank of america their effectiveness and require timely recalibration. the models that we use to assess and control our market risk exposures also reflect assumptions about the degree of correlation among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators, which may not be representative of the next downturn and would magnify the limitations inherent in using historical data to manage risk. market conditions in recent years have involved unprecedented dislocations and highlight the limitations inherent in using historical data to manage risk. our models may also be adversely impacted by human error and may not be effective if we fail to properly oversee and review them at regular intervals and detect their flaws during our review and monitoring processes, they contain erroneous data, assumptions, valuations, formulas or algorithms or our applications running the models do not perform as expected. regardless of the steps we take to help confirm effective controls, governance, monitoring and testing, and implement new technology and automated processes, we could suffer operational, reputational and financial harm, including funding or liquidity shortfalls, if models fail to properly anticipate and manage risks.
failure to properly manage data may result in our inability to manage risk and business needs, errors in our operations, critical reporting and strategic decision-making, inaccurate reporting and non-compliance with laws, rules and regulations.
we rely on our ability to manage and process data in an accurate, timely and complete manner, including capturing, transporting, aggregating, using, transmitting data externally, and retaining and protecting data appropriately. while we continually update our policies, programs, processes and practices and implement emerging technologies, such as automation, ai and robotics, our data management processes may not be effective and are subject to weaknesses and failures, including human error, data limitations, process delays, system failure or failed controls. failure to properly manage data effectively in an accurate, timely and complete manner may adversely impact its quality and reliability and our ability to manage current and emerging risk, produce accurate financial and non-financial, regulatory and operational reporting, detect or surveil potential misconduct or non-compliance with laws, rules and regulations, as well as to manage changing business needs, strategic decision-making, resolution strategy and operations. the failure to establish and maintain effective, efficient and controlled data management could adversely impact our ability to develop our products and relationships with our customers, increase regulatory risk and operational losses, and damage our reputation.
our operations, businesses and customers could be adversely affected by the impacts related to climate change.
climate change and related environmental sustainability matters present short-term and long-term risks to us. the physical risks include an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters, including floods, wildfires, hurricanes and tornados, as well as chronic longer-term shifts such as rising average global temperatures and sea levels. such disasters could impact our facilities and employees and disrupt our operations or the operations of customers or third parties, and result in market volatility or negatively impact our customers' ability to repay outstanding loans, result in rapid deposit outflows or drawdowns of credit facilities, cause supply chain and/or distribution network disruptions, damage collateral or result in the deterioration of the value of collateral or insurance shortfalls.
there is also increasing risk related to the transition to a low-carbon economy. changes in consumer preferences, market pressures, advancements in technology and additional legislation, regulatory and legal requirements could alter the scope of our existing businesses, limit our ability to pursue certain business activities and offer certain products and services, amplify credit and market risks, negatively impact asset values and increase expenses, including as a result of legal, compliance and public disclosure costs in the u.s. and globally with potential jurisdictional divergence, strategic planning, required capital expenditures and changes in technology and markets, including supply chain and insurance availability and cost. we have devoted and expect to continue to devote additional resources as a result of our response to climate change. our climate change strategies, policies, and disclosures, our ability to achieve our climate-related goals, targets and commitments, and/or the environmental or climate impacts attributable to our products, transactions or services will likely result in heightened legal and compliance risk and could result in reputational harm as a result of negative public sentiment, regulatory scrutiny, litigation and reduced investor and stakeholder confidence. our ability to meet our climate-related goals, targets and commitments, including our goal to achieve certain greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions targets by 2030 and net zero ghg emissions in our financing activities, operations and supply chain before 2050, is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control, such as technology advances, clearly defined roadmaps for industry sectors, public policies and better emissions data reporting, and ongoing engagement with customers, suppliers, investors, government officials and other stakeholders.
there are and will continue to be challenges related to capturing, verifying, analyzing and disclosing climate-related data, which includes nonfinancial data and other information that is subject to measurement uncertainties, may not be independently verified, and may result in legal or reputational harm.
our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified employees is critical to our success, business prospects and competitive position.
our performance and competitive position is heavily dependent on the talents, development and efforts of highly skilled individuals. competition for qualified personnel within the financial services industry and from businesses outside the financial services industry is intense.
our competitors include global institutions and institutions subject to different compensation and hiring regulations than those imposed on u.s. institutions and financial institutions. also, our ability to attract, develop and retain employees could be impacted by changing workforce concerns, expectations, practices and preferences (including remote work), and increasing labor shortages and competition for labor, which could increase labor costs.
in order to attract and retain qualified personnel, we must provide market-level compensation. as a large financial and banking institution, we are and may become subject to additional limitations on compensation practices by the federal reserve, the occ, the fdic and other regulators around the world, which may or may not affect our competitors. furthermore, because a substantial portion of our annual incentive compensation paid to many of our employees is long-term equity-based awards based on the value of our common stock, declines in our profitability or outlook could adversely affect the ability to attract and retain employees. if we are unable to continue to attract, develop and retain qualified individuals, our business prospects and competitive position could be adversely affected.

for more information on our capital resources, see capital management on page 49.
changes in u.s. tax law on august 16, 2022, the u.s. enacted the inflation reduction act of 2022, which contained a number of tax-related provisions. the tax changes included the extension and expansion of renewable energy tax credit programs, the establishment of a new 15 percent alternative minimum tax (amt) on adjusted financial statement income for large corporations and a one percent excise tax on stock repurchases. for more information, see financial highlights - income tax expense on page 29.
russia/ukraine conflict due to the russia/ukraine conflict, there has been significant volatility in financial and commodities markets, and multiple jurisdictions have implemented various economic sanctions. at december 31, 2022 and 2021, our direct net country exposure to russia was $443 million and $733 million, primarily consisting of outstanding loans and leases totaling $391 million and $686 million, and our net country exposure to ukraine was not significant. while the corporation's direct exposure to russia is limited, the potential duration, course and impact of the russia/ukraine conflict remain uncertain and could adversely affect macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, which could negatively impact the corporation's businesses, results of operations and financial position. for more information on the risks related to the russia/ukraine conflict, see the market, credit and geopolitical sections in item 1a. risk factors on page 8.
libor and other benchmark rates after december 31, 2021, ice benchmark administration (iba) ceased publishing british pound sterling (gbp), euro, swiss franc, and japanese yen (jpy) london interbank offered rate (libor) settings and one-week and two-month u.s. dollar (usd) libor settings, subject to the continued publication of certain non-representative libor settings based on a modified calculation (i.e., on a "synthetic" basis). the remaining usd libor settings (i.e., overnight, one month, three month, six month and 12 month) will cease or become non-representative immediately after june 30, 2023, although the financial conduct authority (fca) has issued a consultation seeking views on whether to compel publication of the one-month, three-month and six-month usd libor settings on a "synthetic" basis for a short time after june 30, 2023 (i.e., through september 30, 2024). separately, the federal reserve, the office of the comptroller of the currency and the federal deposit insurance corporation (fdic) issued supervisory guidance encouraging banks to cease entering into new contracts that use usd libor as a reference rate by december 31, 2021, subject to certain regulatory-approved exceptions (usd libor guidance).
as a result, a major transition has been and continues to be in progress in the global financial markets with respect to the replacement of interbank offered rates (ibors). this has been and continues to be a complex process impacting a variety of our businesses and operations. ibors have historically been used in many of the corporation's products and contracts, including derivatives, consumer and commercial loans, mortgages, floating-rate notes and other adjustable-rate products and financial instruments. in response, the corporation established an enterprise-wide ibor transition program, with active involvement of senior management and regular reports to the management risk committee (mrc) and enterprise risk committee (erc). the program continues to drive the corporation's industry and regulatory engagement, client and financial contract changes, internal and external communications, technology and operations modifications, including updates to its operational models, systems and processes, introduction of new products, migration of existing clients, and program strategy and governance.
as of december 31, 2021, the corporation transitioned or otherwise addressed ibor-based products and contracts referencing the rates that ceased or became non-representative after december 31, 2021, including libor-linked commercial loans, libor-based adjustable-rate consumer mortgages, libor-linked derivatives and interdealer trading of certain usd libor and other interest rate swaps, and related hedging arrangements. additionally, in accordance with the usd libor guidance, the corporation has ceased entering into new contracts that use usd libor as a reference rate, subject to limited exceptions, including those consistent with supervisory guidance.
the corporation launched capabilities and services to support the issuance of and trading in products indexed to various alternative reference rates (arrs) and developed employee training programs as well as other internal and external sources of information on the various challenges and opportunities that the replacement of ibors has presented and continues to present. the corporation continues to monitor a variety of market scenarios as part of its transition efforts, including risks associated with insufficient preparation by bank of america individual market participants or the overall market ecosystem, ability of market participants to meet regulatory and industry-wide recommended milestones, and access and demand by clients and market participants to liquidity in certain products, including libor products.
with respect to the transition of libor products referencing usd libor settings ceasing or becoming non-representative as of june 30, 2023, a significant majority of the corporation's notional contractual exposure to such libor settings, of which the significant majority is derivatives contracts, have been remediated (i.e., updated to include fallback provisions to arrs based on market-driven protocols, regulatory guidance and industry-recommended fallback provisions and related mechanisms), and the corporation is continuing to remediate the remaining usd libor exposure. for example, during the first half of 2023, certain central counterparties (ccps) expect to complete processes to convert outstanding usd libor-cleared derivatives to arr positions. the remaining exposure, a majority of which is made up of derivatives and commercial loans and which represents a small minority of outstanding usd libor notional contractual exposure of the corporation, requires active dialogue with clients to modify the contracts. for any residual exposures after june 2023 that continue to have no fallback provisions, the corporation continues to assess and plans to leverage relevant contractual and statutory solutions, including the adjustable interest rate (libor) act in the u.s. (as implemented by the federal reserve) and "synthetic" usd libor (if the fca compels such publication), to transition such exposure.
while there remain risks to the corporation associated with the transition from ibors (as discussed under item 1a. risk factors - other on page 20), such risks have been monitored and, where applicable, managed through the corporation's efforts and dedicated operational resources to date. in the corporation's view, the potential likelihood and/or impact of transition-related risks has lessened over time, and the corporation anticipates it has devoted appropriate resources to remaining transition efforts and will be able to continue to appropriately monitor and manage such risks as the transition process continues. the corporation expects transition-related risks to further diminish as certain market developments occur prior to june 30, 2023.
the corporation has implemented regulatory, tax and accounting changes and continues to monitor current and potential impacts of the transition, including internal revenue service tax regulations and guidance and financial accounting standards board guidance. in addition, the corporation has engaged impacted clients in connection with the transition by providing education on arrs and the timing of transition events. the corporation is also working actively with global regulators, industry working groups and trade associations.

net income was $27.5 billion, or $3.19 per diluted share in 2022 compared to $32.0 billion, or $3.57 per diluted share in 2021. the decrease in net income was primarily due to an increase in provision for credit losses, lower noninterest income and higher noninterest expense, partially offset by higher net interest income.

net interest income net interest income increased $9.5 billion to $52.5 billion in 2022 compared to 2021. net interest yield on a fully taxable-equivalent (fte) basis increased 30 basis points (bps) to 1.96 percent for 2022. the increase was primarily driven by benefits from higher interest rates, including lower premium amortization expense, and loan growth, partially offset by a lower amount of accelerated net capitalized loan fees due to paycheck protection program (ppp) loan forgiveness, which primarily occurred in 2021. for more information on net interest yield and the fte basis, see supplemental financial data on page 32, and for bank of america more information on interest rate risk management, see interest rate risk management for the banking book on page 79.

noninterest income decreased $3.7 billion to $42.5 billion for 2022 compared to 2021. the following highlights the significant changes.
●    service charges decreased $1.1 billion primarily driven by the impact of non-sufficient funds and overdraft policy changes as well as lower treasury service charges.
●    investment and brokerage services decreased $789 million primarily driven by lower market valuations and declines in assets under management (aum) pricing, partially offset by positive aum flows.
●    investment banking fees decreased $4.1 billion primarily driven by a decline in demand resulting in lower equity and debt issuance fees and lower advisory fees.
●    market making and similar activities increased $3.4 billion primarily driven by improved performance across macro products in fixed income, currencies and commodities (ficc) and by the impact of higher interest rates on client financing activities in equities.
●    other income decreased $988 million primarily due to certain valuation adjustments.
provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses increased $7.1 billion to $2.5 billion for 2022 compared to 2021. the provision for credit losses for 2022 was primarily driven by loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reserve release for reduced covid-19 pandemic (the pandemic) uncertainties. for the same period in the prior year, the benefit in the provision for credit losses was due to an improved macroeconomic outlook. for more information on the provision for credit losses, see allowance for credit losses on page 73.

noninterest expense increased $1.7 billion to $61.4 billion in 2022 compared to 2021. the increase was primarily due to higher investments in people and technology, expense associated with the settlement of the legacy monoline insurance litigation and expense related to certain regulatory matters, partially offset by lower net covid-19 related costs.

income tax expense was $3.4 billion for 2022 compared to $2.0 billion in 2021 resulting in an effective tax rate of 11.1 percent compared to 5.9 percent.
the effective tax rates for 2022 and 2021 were primarily driven by our recurring preference benefits. also included in the effective tax rate for 2021 was the impact of the 2021 u.k. tax law change further discussed in this section. for more information on our recurring tax preference benefits, see note 19 - income taxes to the consolidated financial statements. absent environmental, social and governance (esg) tax credits and discrete tax benefits, the effective tax rates would have been approximately 25 percent.
on august 16, 2022, the u.s. enacted the inflation reduction act of 2022, which contained a number of tax-related provisions, including the extension and expansion of renewable energy tax credit programs. in particular, partnerships are no longer solely limited to an investment tax credit, but can now also elect a production tax credit for solar energy production facilities placed in service after december 31, 2021.
other notable tax law changes include the establishment of a new 15 percent amt on adjusted financial statement income for large corporations and a one percent excise tax on net stock repurchases, both of which were effective for tax years beginning on or after january 1, 2023. the tax law changes for the new amt permit business credits, including those from esg investments in renewable energy and affordable housing, to offset potential amt liability. the corporation has assessed the potential impacts of these two u.s. tax law changes and does not expect the changes to have a significant effect on its future effective tax rate.
on june 10, 2021, the u.k. enacted the 2021 finance act, which increased the u.k. corporation income tax rate to 25 percent from 19 percent. this change is effective april 1, 2023 and unfavorably affects income tax expense on future u.k. earnings. as a result, during the three months ended june 30, 2021, the corporation recorded a positive income tax adjustment of approximately $2.0 billion with a corresponding write-up of u.k. net deferred tax assets, which reflected a reversal of previously recorded write-downs of net deferred tax assets for prior changes in the u.k. corporation income tax rate.

assets at december 31, 2022, total assets were approximately $3.1 trillion, down $118.1 billion from december 31, 2021. the decrease in assets was primarily due to lower debt securities and cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by an increase in loans and leases, trading account assets and federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell.
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents decreased $118.0 billion primarily driven by lower deposits and continued loan growth.
federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell federal funds transactions involve lending reserve balances on a short-term basis. securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell are collateralized lending transactions utilized to accommodate customer transactions, earn interest rate spreads and obtain securities for settlement and for collateral. federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell increased $16.9 billion primarily due to client activity within global markets.
trading account assets trading account assets consist primarily of long positions in equity and fixed-income securities including u.s. government and agency securities, corporate securities and non-u.s. sovereign debt. trading account assets increased $49.0 billion primarily due to client activity within global markets.
debt securities debt securities primarily include u.s. treasury and agency securities, mortgage-backed securities (mbs), principally agency mbs, non-u.s. bonds, corporate bonds and municipal debt. we use the debt securities portfolio primarily to manage interest rate and liquidity risk and to leverage market conditions that create economically attractive returns on these investments. debt securities decreased $119.8 billion primarily driven by lower deposits and continued loan growth. for more information on debt securities, see note 4 - securities to the consolidated financial statements.
bank of america loans and leases loans and leases increased $66.6 billion primarily driven by growth in commercial loans, higher credit card spending and higher residential mortgages due to lower paydowns and continued originations. for more information on the loan portfolio, see credit risk management on page 59.
allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses increased $295 million primarily driven by loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reserve release for reduced pandemic uncertainties. for more information, see allowance for credit losses on page 73.
all other assets all other assets decreased $12.5 billion primarily driven by a decline in margin loans and loans held-for-sale (lhfs).
liabilities at december 31, 2022, total liabilities were approximately $2.8 trillion, down $121.3 billion from december 31, 2021, primarily due to lower deposits.
deposits deposits decreased $134.1 billion primarily due to an increase in customer spending and a shift to higher yielding accounts.
federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase federal funds transactions involve borrowing reserve balances on a short-term basis. securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase are collateralized borrowing transactions utilized to accommodate customer transactions, earn interest rate spreads and finance assets on the balance sheet. federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase increased $3.3 billion primarily driven by an increase in repurchase agreements to support liquidity.
trading account liabilities trading account liabilities consist primarily of short positions in equity and fixed-income securities including u.s. treasury and agency securities, non-u.s. sovereign debt and corporate securities. trading account liabilities decreased $20.3 billion primarily due to lower levels of short positions within global markets.
short-term borrowings short-term borrowings provide an additional funding source and primarily consist of federal home loan bank (fhlb) short-term borrowings, notes payable and various other borrowings that generally have maturities of one year or less. short-term borrowings increased $3.2 billion primarily due to an increase in fhlb advances and commercial paper to manage liquidity needs. for more information on short-term borrowings, see note 10 - securities financing agreements, short-term borrowings, collateral and restricted cash to the consolidated financial statements.
long-term debt long-term debt decreased $4.1 billion primarily due to maturities, redemptions and valuation adjustments, partially offset by issuances. for more information on long-term debt, see note 11 - long-term debt to the consolidated financial statements.
all other liabilities all other liabilities increased $30.8 billion primarily driven by global markets client activity.
shareholders' equity shareholders' equity increased $3.1 billion primarily due to net income and the issuance of preferred stock, partially offset by market value decreases on derivatives and debt securities, and returns of capital to shareholders through common and preferred stock dividends and common stock repurchases.
cash flows overview the corporation's operating assets and liabilities support our global markets and lending activities. we believe that cash flows from operations, available cash balances and our ability to generate cash through short- and long-term debt are sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs. our investing activities primarily include the debt securities portfolio and loans and leases. our financing activities reflect cash flows primarily related to customer deposits, securities financing agreements, long-term debt and common and preferred stock. for more information on liquidity, see liquidity risk on page 54.
bank of america supplemental financial data non-gaap financial measures in this form 10-k, we present certain non-gaap financial measures. non-gaap financial measures exclude certain items or otherwise include components that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with gaap. non-gaap financial measures are provided as additional useful information to assess our financial condition, results of operations (including period-to-period operating performance) or compliance with prospective regulatory requirements. these non-gaap financial measures are not intended as a substitute for gaap financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as non-gaap financial measures used by other companies.
we view net interest income and related ratios and analyses on an fte basis, which when presented on a consolidated basis are non-gaap financial measures. to derive the fte basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. for purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent and a representative state tax rate. net interest yield, which measures the basis points we earn over the cost of funds, utilizes net interest income on an fte basis. we believe that presentation of these items on an fte basis allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices.
we may present certain key performance indicators and ratios excluding certain items (e.g., debit valuation adjustment (dva) gains (losses)), which result in non-gaap financial measures. we believe that the presentation of measures that exclude these items is useful because such measures provide additional information to assess the underlying operational performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance.
we also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-gaap financial measure. tangible equity represents shareholders' equity or common shareholders' equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights (msrs)), net of related deferred tax liabilities ("adjusted" shareholders' equity or common shareholders' equity). these measures are used to evaluate our use of equity. in addition, profitability, relationship and investment models use both return on average tangible common shareholders' equity and return on average tangible shareholders' equity as key measures to support our overall growth objectives. these ratios are:
●    return on average tangible common shareholders' equity measures our net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders' equity. the tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders' equity divided by total tangible assets.
●    return on average tangible shareholders' equity measures our net income as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders' equity. the tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders' equity divided by total tangible assets.
●    tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders' equity divided by ending common shares outstanding.
we believe ratios utilizing tangible equity provide additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. tangible book value per common share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of common stock.
the aforementioned supplemental data and performance measures are presented in tables 6 and 7.
for more information on the reconciliation of these non-gaap financial measures to the corresponding gaap financial measures, see non-gaap reconciliations on page 85.
key performance indicators we present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators (key performance indicators) that management uses when assessing our consolidated and/or segment results. we believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information about our underlying operational performance and trends. these key performance indicators (kpis) may not be defined or calculated in the same way as similar kpis used by other companies. for information on how these metrics are defined, see key metrics on page 167.
our consolidated key performance indicators, which include various equity and credit metrics, are presented in table 1 on page 28, table 6 on page 33 and table 7 on page 34.
for information on key segment performance metrics, see business segment operations on page 37.

bank of america business segment operations segment description and basis of presentation we report our results of operations through the following four business segments: consumer banking, gwim, global banking and global markets, with the remaining operations recorded in all other. we manage our segments and report their results on an fte basis. the primary activities, products and businesses of the business segments and all other are shown below.
we periodically review capital allocated to our businesses and allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. we utilize a methodology that considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to internal risk-based capital models. our internal risk-based capital models use a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment's credit, market, interest rate, business and operational risk components. for more information on the nature of these risks, see managing risk on page 46. the capital allocated to the business segments is referred to as allocated capital. allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit. for more information, including the definition of a reporting unit, see note 7 - goodwill and intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements.
for more information on our presentation of financial information on an fte basis, see supplemental financial data on page 32, and for reconciliations to consolidated total revenue, net income and year-end total assets, see note 23 - business segment information to the consolidated financial statements.

(1)estimated at the segment level only.
(2)in segments and businesses where the total of liabilities and equity exceeds assets, we allocate assets from all other to match the segments' and businesses' liabilities and allocated shareholders' equity. as a result, total earning assets and total assets of the businesses may not equal total consumer banking.
n/m = not meaningful consumer banking, comprised of deposits and consumer lending, offers a diversified range of credit, banking and investment products and services to consumers and small businesses. deposits and consumer lending include the net impact of migrating customers and their related deposit, brokerage asset and loan balances between deposits, consumer lending and gwim, as well as other client-managed businesses. our customers and clients have access to a coast-to-coast network including financial centers in 38 states and the district of columbia. as of december 31, 2022, our network includes approximately 3,900 financial centers, approximately 16,000 atms, nationwide call centers and leading digital banking platforms with more than 44 million active users, including approximately 35 million active mobile users.
consumer banking results net income for consumer banking increased $625 million to $12.5 billion due to higher revenue, partially offset by an increase in provision for credit losses and higher noninterest expense. net interest income increased $5.1 billion to $30.0 billion primarily driven by higher interest rates and the benefits of higher deposit and loan balances, partially offset by a lower amount of accelerated net capitalized loan fees due to ppp loan forgiveness, which primarily occurred in 2021. noninterest income decreased $486 million to $8.6 billion primarily driven by the impact of non-sufficient funds and overdraft policy changes, partially offset by a gain on the sale of an affinity card loan portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2022.
the provision for credit losses increased $3.0 billion to $2.0 billion primarily driven by loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic outlook in 2022, compared to a benefit in 2021 due to an improved macroeconomic outlook. noninterest expense increased $787 million to $20.1 billion primarily driven by continued investments for business growth, including marketing, technology and people, as well as increased client activity, partially offset by an impairment charge for real estate rationalization and the contribution to the bank of america foundation in the prior year.
the return on average allocated capital was 31 percent, unchanged from 2021. for more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see business segment operations on page 37.
deposits deposits includes the results of consumer deposit activities that consist of a comprehensive range of products provided to consumers and small businesses. our deposit products include noninterest- and interest-bearing checking accounts, money market savings accounts, traditional savings accounts, cds and iras, as well as investment accounts and products. net interest income is allocated to deposit products using our funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. deposits generates fees such as account service fees and atm fees, as well as investment and brokerage fees from consumer investment accounts. consumer investments serves investment client relationships through the merrill edge integrated investing and banking service platform, providing investment advice and guidance, client brokerage asset services, self-directed online investing and key banking capabilities including access to the bank of america corporation's network of financial centers and atms.
net income for deposits increased $2.4 billion to $7.1 billion due to higher revenue, partially offset by higher noninterest expense and an increase in provision for credit losses. net interest income increased $4.9 billion to $19.3 billion primarily due to higher interest rates and the benefit of higher deposit balances. noninterest income decreased $585 million to $3.1 billion primarily driven by the impact of non-sufficient funds and overdraft policy changes, partially offset by higher other service charges due to increased client activity.
the provision for credit losses increased $324 million to $564 million primarily driven by increased overdraft losses due to higher payment activity related to checking accounts. the benefit in the prior year was due to an improved macroeconomic outlook. noninterest expense increased $743 million to $12.4 billion primarily driven by continued investments for business growth and increased client activity, partially offset by an impairment charge for real estate rationalization in the prior year.
average deposits increased $80.7 billion to $1.1 trillion primarily due to net inflows of $46.8 billion in checking and $34.9 billion in money market savings largely driven by strong organic growth.
the table below provides key performance indicators for deposits. management uses these metrics, and we believe they are useful to investors because they provide additional information to evaluate our deposit profitability and digital/mobile trends.

consumer lending consumer lending offers products to consumers and small businesses across the u.s. the products offered include debit and credit cards, residential mortgages and home equity loans, and direct and indirect loans such as automotive, recreational vehicle and consumer personal loans. in addition to earning net interest spread revenue on its lending activities, consumer lending generates interchange revenue from debit and credit card transactions, late fees, cash advance fees, annual credit card fees, mortgage banking fee income and other miscellaneous fees. consumer lending products are available to our customers through our retail network, direct telephone, and online and mobile channels. consumer lending results also include the impact of servicing residential mortgages and home equity loans, including loans held on the balance sheet of consumer lending and loans serviced for others.
net income for consumer lending decreased $1.8 billion to $5.4 billion primarily due to an increase in provision for credit losses. net interest income increased $220 million to $10.8 billion primarily due to higher interest rates and loan balances, largely offset by a lower amount of accelerated net capitalized loan fees due to ppp loan forgiveness, which primarily occurred in 2021. noninterest income increased $99 million to $5.4 billion primarily driven by a gain on the sale of an affinity card loan portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2022.
the provision for credit losses increased $2.7 billion to $1.4 billion primarily driven by loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic environment in 2022 compared to a benefit in 2021 due to an improved macroeconomic outlook. noninterest expense increased $44 million to $7.7 billion largely driven by continued investments for business growth and increased client activity, partially offset by the contribution to the bank of america foundation in the prior year.
average loans increased $8.6 billion to $288.2 billion primarily driven by an increase in credit card loans and first mortgage loans, partially offset by a decline in ppp loans.

gwim consists of two primary businesses: merrill wealth management and bank of america private bank.
merrill wealth management's advisory business provides a high-touch client experience through a network of financial advisors focused on clients with over $250,000 in total investable assets. merrill wealth management provides tailored solutions to meet clients' needs through a full set of investment management, brokerage, banking and retirement products.
bank of america private bank, together with merrill wealth management's private wealth management business, provides comprehensive wealth management solutions targeted to high net worth and ultra high net worth clients, as well as customized solutions to meet clients' wealth structuring, investment management, trust and banking needs, including specialty asset management services.
net income for gwim increased $348 million to $4.7 billion driven by higher revenue, partially offset by higher provision for credit losses and noninterest expense. the operating margin remained unchanged at 28 percent compared to a year ago.
net interest income increased $1.8 billion to $7.5 billion due to the impacts of higher interest rates, as well as the benefits of higher loan and deposit balances.
noninterest income, which primarily includes investment and brokerage services income, decreased $802 million to $14.3 billion primarily due to the impacts of lower market valuations and declines in aum pricing, partially offset by the impact of positive aum flows.
the provision for credit losses increased $307 million primarily due to a dampened macroeconomic outlook and loan growth in the current-year period, compared to a benefit in the prior-year period due to an improved macroeconomic outlook. noninterest expense increased $232 million to $15.5 billion primarily due to continued investments in the business, partially offset by lower revenue-related incentives.
the return on average allocated capital was 27 percent, up from 26 percent, due to higher net income, partially offset by an increase in allocated capital. for more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see business segment operations on page 37.
average loans increased $22.9 billion to $219.8 billion primarily due to residential mortgage, securities-based lending and custom lending. average deposits increased $11.2 billion to $351.3 billion primarily driven by inflows from new and existing accounts.
merrill wealth management revenue of $18.1 billion increased four percent primarily driven by the benefits of higher interest rates, as well as higher deposit and loan balances, partially offset by the impact of lower market valuations and declines in aum pricing.
bank of america private bank revenue of $3.6 billion increased nine percent primarily driven by the benefits of higher interest rates, as well as higher deposit and loan balances, partially offset by the impact of lower market valuations.

global banking, which includes global corporate banking, global commercial banking, business banking and global investment banking, provides a wide range of lending-related products and services, integrated working capital management and treasury solutions, and underwriting and advisory services through our network of offices and client relationship teams. our lending products and services include commercial loans, leases, commitment facilities, trade finance, commercial real estate lending and asset-based lending. our treasury solutions business includes treasury management, foreign exchange, short-term investing options and merchant services. we also provide investment banking services to our clients such as debt and equity underwriting and distribution, and merger-related and other advisory services. underwriting debt and equity issuances, fixed-income and equity research, and certain market-based activities are executed through our global broker-dealer affiliates, which are our primary dealers in several countries. within global banking, global corporate banking clients generally include large global corporations, financial institutions and leasing clients. global commercial banking clients generally include middle-market companies, commercial real estate firms and not-for-profit companies. business banking clients include mid-sized u.s.-based businesses requiring customized and integrated financial advice and solutions.
net income for global banking decreased $2.0 billion to $7.8 billion driven by higher provision for credit losses and noninterest expense, partially offset by higher revenue.
net interest income increased $3.7 billion to $12.2 billion primarily due to the benefits of higher interest rates and loan balances.
noninterest income decreased $2.3 billion to $10.0 billion driven by lower investment banking fees and valuation adjustments on leveraged loans, as well as lower treasury service charges.
the provision for credit losses increased $3.8 billion to $641 million primarily driven by a dampened macroeconomic outlook and loan growth, compared to a benefit in the prior year due to an improved macroeconomic outlook.
noninterest expense increased $334 million to $11.0 billion, primarily due to continued investments in the business, including strategic hiring and technology.
the return on average allocated capital was 18 percent, down from 23 percent, due to lower net income and higher allocated capital. for more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see business segment operations on page 37.
global corporate, global commercial and business banking global corporate, global commercial and business banking each include business lending and global transaction services activities. business lending includes various lending-related products and services, and related hedging activities, including commercial loans, leases, commitment facilities, trade finance, real estate lending and asset-based lending. global transaction services includes deposits, treasury management, credit card, foreign exchange and short-term investment products.

global markets offers sales and trading services and research services to institutional clients across fixed-income, credit, currency, commodity and equity businesses. global markets product coverage includes securities and derivative products in both the primary and secondary markets. global markets provides market-making, financing, securities clearing, settlement and custody services globally to our institutional investor clients in support of their investing and trading activities. we also work with our commercial and corporate clients to provide risk management products using interest rate, equity, credit, currency and commodity derivatives, foreign exchange, fixed-income and mortgage-related products. as a result of our market-making activities in these products, we may be required to manage risk in a broad range of financial products including government securities, equity and equity-linked securities, high-grade and high-yield corporate debt securities, syndicated loans, mbs, commodities and asset-backed securities. the economics of certain investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between global markets and global banking under an internal revenue-sharing arrangement. global banking originates certain deal-related transactions with our corporate and commercial clients that are executed and distributed by global markets. for information on investment banking fees on a consolidated basis, see page 43.
the following explanations for year-over-year changes for global markets, including those disclosed under sales and trading revenue, are the same for amounts including and excluding net dva. amounts excluding net dva are a non-gaap financial measure. for more information on net dva, see supplemental financial data on page 32.
net income for global markets decreased $375 million to $4.2 billion. net dva gains were $20 million compared to losses of $54 million in 2021. excluding net dva, net income decreased $431 million to $4.2 billion. these decreases were primarily driven by lower revenue, partially offset by lower noninterest expense.
revenue decreased $1.1 billion to $18.1 billion primarily due to lower investment banking fees, partially offset by higher sales and trading revenue. sales and trading revenue increased $1.3 billion, and excluding net dva, sales and trading revenue increased $1.2 billion. these increases were driven by higher revenue in both ficc and equities.
noninterest expense decreased $612 million to $12.4 billion primarily driven by the realignment of a liquidating business activity from global markets to all other in the fourth quarter of 2021 and an acceleration of expenses from incentive compensation award changes in the prior year.
average total assets increased $71.6 billion to $857.6 billion driven by loan growth and commodities activity in ficc. period-end total assets increased $64.7 billion to $812.5 billion bank of america 44
driven by loan growth, an increase in commodities activity, and higher derivative balances due to higher interest rates.
the return on average allocated capital was 10 percent, down from 12 percent, reflecting lower net income and an increase in allocated capital. for more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see business segment operations on page 37.
sales and trading revenue sales and trading revenue includes unrealized and realized gains and losses on trading and other assets which are included in market making and similar activities, net interest income, and fees primarily from commissions on equity securities. sales and trading revenue is segregated into fixed-income (government debt obligations, investment and non-investment grade corporate debt obligations, commercial mbs, residential mortgage-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations, interest rate and credit derivative contracts), currencies (interest rate and foreign exchange contracts), commodities (primarily futures, forwards, swaps and options) and equities (equity-linked derivatives and cash equity activity). the following table and related discussion present sales and trading revenue, substantially all of which is in global markets, with the remainder in global banking. in addition, the following table and related discussion also present sales and trading revenue, excluding net dva, which is a non-gaap financial measure. for more information on net dva, see supplemental financial data on page 32.

n/m = not meaningful all other primarily consists of asset and liability management (alm) activities, liquidating businesses and certain expenses not otherwise allocated to a business segment. alm activities encompass interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities for which substantially all of the results are allocated to our business segments. for more information on our alm activities, see note 23 - business segment information to the consolidated financial statements.
net income decreased $3.0 billion to a loss of $1.7 billion primarily due to a lower income tax benefit and higher noninterest expense.
noninterest expense increased $966 million primarily driven by the realignment of a liquidating business activity from global markets to all other in the fourth quarter of 2021, expense associated with the settlement of the legacy monoline insurance litigation and expense related to certain regulatory matters, partially offset by decreases in other expenses.
bank of america the income tax benefit was $6.0 billion in 2022 compared to a benefit of $8.1 billion in 2021. the decrease in the tax benefit was primarily driven by the impact of the u.k. tax law change in 2021. for more information, see financial highlights - income tax expense on page 29. both periods included income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the fte treatment of certain tax credits recorded in global banking and global markets.
managing risk risk is inherent in all our business activities. sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders. if not managed well, risk can result in financial loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and damage to our reputation, each of which may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategies. we take a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined risk framework and an articulated risk appetite statement, which are approved annually by the erc and the board.
the seven key types of risk faced by the corporation are strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational.
●    strategic risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition arising from incorrect assumptions about external or internal factors, inappropriate business plans, ineffective business strategy execution or failure to respond in a timely manner to changes in the regulatory, macroeconomic or competitive environments in the geographic locations in which we operate.
●    credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability or failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its obligations.
●    market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities or otherwise negatively impact earnings. market risk is composed of price risk and interest rate risk.
●    liquidity risk is the inability to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral needs while continuing to support our businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions.
●    compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or damage to the reputation of the corporation arising from the failure of the corporation to comply with the requirements of applicable laws, rules and regulations and our internal policies and procedures.
●    operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, people or external events.
●    reputational risk is the risk that negative perception of the corporation may adversely impact profitability or operations.
the following sections address in more detail the specific procedures, measures and analyses of the major categories of risk. this discussion of managing risk focuses on the current risk framework that, as part of its annual review process, was approved by the erc and the board.
as set forth in our risk framework, a culture of managing risk well is fundamental to our values and our purpose, and how we drive responsible growth. it requires us to focus on risk in all activities and encourages the necessary mindset and behavior to enable effective risk management and promote sound risk-taking within our risk appetite. sustaining a culture of managing risk well throughout the organization is critical to the success of the corporation and is a clear expectation of our executive management team and the board.
our risk framework serves as the foundation for the consistent and effective management of risks facing the corporation. the risk framework sets forth roles and responsibilities for the management of risk and provides a blueprint for how the board, through delegation of authority to committees and executive officers, establishes risk appetite and associated limits for our activities.
executive management assesses, with board oversight, the risk-adjusted returns of each business. management reviews and approves the strategic and financial operating plans, as well as the capital plan and risk appetite statement, and recommends them annually to the board for approval. our strategic plan takes into consideration return objectives and financial resources, which must align with risk capacity and risk appetite. management sets financial objectives for each business by allocating capital and setting a target for return on capital for each business. capital allocations and operating limits are regularly evaluated as part of our overall governance processes as the businesses and the economic environment in which we operate continue to evolve. for more information regarding capital allocations, see business segment operations on page 37.
the corporation's risk appetite indicates the amount of capital, earnings or liquidity we are willing to put at risk to achieve our strategic objectives and business plans, consistent with applicable regulatory requirements. our risk appetite provides a common framework that includes a set of measures to assist senior management and the board in assessing the corporation's risk profile against our risk appetite and risk capacity. our risk appetite is formally articulated in the risk appetite statement, which includes both qualitative statements and quantitative limits.
our overall capacity to take risk is limited; therefore, we prioritize the risks we take in order to maintain a strong and flexible financial position so we can withstand challenging economic conditions and take advantage of organic growth opportunities. therefore, we set objectives and targets for capital and liquidity that are intended to permit us to continue to operate in a safe and sound manner at all times, including during periods of stress.
our lines of business operate with risk limits that align with the corporation's risk appetite. senior management is responsible for tracking and reporting performance measurements as well as any exceptions to risk appetite limits. the board, and its committees when appropriate, oversee financial performance, execution of the strategic and financial operating plans, adherence to risk appetite limits and the adequacy of internal controls.
for a more detailed discussion of our risk management activities, see the discussion below and pages 49 through 82.
risk management governance the risk framework describes delegations of authority whereby the board and its committees may delegate authority to management-level committees or executive officers. such delegations may authorize certain decision-making and approval functions, which may be evidenced in documents such as committee charters, job descriptions, meeting minutes and resolutions.
the chart below illustrates the interrelationship among the board, board committees and management committees that have the majority of risk oversight responsibilities for the corporation.
bank of america board of directors and board committees the board is composed of 15 directors, all but one of whom are independent. the board authorizes management to maintain an effective risk framework and oversees compliance with safe and sound banking practices. in addition, the board or its committees conduct inquiries of, and receive reports from senior management on, risk-related matters to assess scope or resource limitations that could impede the ability of global risk management (grm) and/or corporate audit to execute its responsibilities. the board committees discussed below have the principal responsibility for enterprise-wide oversight of our risk management activities. through these activities, the board and applicable committees are provided with information on our risk profile and oversee senior management addressing key risks we face. other board committees, as described below, provide additional oversight of specific risks.
each of the committees shown on the above chart regularly reports to the board on risk-related matters within the committee's responsibilities, which is intended to collectively provide the board with integrated insight about our management of enterprise-wide risks.
audit committee the audit committee oversees the qualifications, performance and independence of the independent registered public accounting firm, the performance of our corporate audit function, the integrity of our consolidated financial statements, our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and makes inquiries of senior management or the chief audit executive (cae) to determine whether there are scope or resource limitations that impede the ability of corporate audit to execute its responsibilities. the audit committee is also responsible for overseeing compliance risks pursuant to the new york stock exchange listing standards.
enterprise risk committee the erc oversees the corporation's risk framework, risk appetite and senior management's responsibilities for the identification, measurement, monitoring and control of key risks facing the corporation. the erc may consult with other board committees on risk-related matters.
other board committees our corporate governance, esg, and sustainability committee oversees our board's governance processes, identifies and reviews the qualifications of potential board members, leads board and committee succession planning and their formal self-evaluation, and reviews our esg activities, shareholder input and shareholder engagement process.
our compensation and human capital committee oversees establishing, maintaining and administering our compensation programs and employee benefit plans, including approving and recommending our chief executive officer's (ceo) compensation to our board for further approval by all independent directors; reviewing and approving our executive officers' compensation, as well as compensation for non-management directors; and reviewing certain other human capital management topics, including pay equity and diversity and inclusion.
management committees management committees receive their authority from the board, a board committee, or another management committee. our primary management risk committee is the mrc. subject to board oversight, the mrc is responsible for management oversight of key risks facing the corporation, including an integrated evaluation of risk, earnings, capital and liquidity.
lines of defense we have clear ownership and accountability for managing risk across three lines of defense: front line units (flus), grm and corporate audit. we also have control functions outside of flus and grm (e.g., legal and global human resources). the three lines of defense are integrated into our management-level governance structure. each of these functional roles is further described in this section.
executive officers executive officers lead various functions representing the functional roles. authority for functional roles may be delegated to executive officers from the board, board committees or management-level committees. executive officers, in turn, may further delegate responsibilities, as appropriate, to management-level committees, management routines or individuals. executive officers review our activities for consistency with our risk framework, risk appetite, and applicable strategic, capital and financial operating plans, as well as applicable policies and standards. executive officers and other employees make decisions individually on a day-to-day basis, consistent with the authority they have been delegated. executive officers and other employees may also serve on committees and participate in committee decisions.
bank of america front line units flus, which include the lines of business as well as global technology and global operations, are responsible for appropriately assessing and effectively managing all of the risks associated with their activities.
three organizational units that include flu activities and control function activities, but are not part of grm are first, the chief financial officer group; second, the chief administrative officer group; and third, global strategy and enterprise platforms.
global risk management grm is part of our control functions and operates as our independent risk management function. grm, led by the chief risk officer (cro), is responsible for independently assessing and overseeing risks within flus and other control functions. grm establishes written enterprise policies and procedures outlining how aggregate risks are identified, measured, monitored and controlled.
the cro has the stature, authority and independence needed to develop and implement a meaningful risk management framework and practices to guide the corporation in managing risk. the cro has unrestricted access to the board and reports directly to both the erc and the ceo. grm is organized into horizontal risk teams that cover a specific risk area and vertical cro teams that cover a particular flu or control function. these teams work collaboratively in executing their respective duties.
corporate audit corporate audit and the cae maintain their independence from the flus, grm and other control functions by reporting directly to the audit committee. the cae administratively reports to the ceo. corporate audit provides independent assessment and validation through testing of key processes and controls across the corporation. corporate audit includes credit review, which provides an independent assessment of credit lending decisions and the effectiveness of credit processes across the corporation's credit platform through examinations and monitoring.
risk management processes the risk framework requires that strong risk management practices are integrated in key strategic, capital and financial planning processes and in day-to-day business processes across the corporation, thereby ensuring risks are appropriately considered, evaluated and responded to in a timely manner. we employ an effective risk management process, referred to as identify, measure, monitor and control, as part of our daily activities.
identify - to be effectively managed, risks must be proactively identified and well understood. proper risk identification focuses on recognizing and understanding key risks inherent in our business activities or key risks that may arise from external factors. each employee is expected to identify and escalate risks promptly. risk identification is an ongoing process that incorporates input from flus and control functions. it is designed to be forward-looking and to capture relevant risk factors across all of our lines of business.
measure - once a risk is identified, it must be prioritized and accurately measured through a systematic process including qualitative statements and quantitative limits. risk is measured at various levels, including, but not limited to, risk type, flu and legal entity, and also on an aggregate basis. this risk measurement process helps to capture changes in our risk profile due to changes in strategic direction, concentrations, portfolio quality and the overall economic environment. senior management considers how risk exposures might evolve under a variety of stress scenarios.
monitor - we monitor risk levels regularly to track adherence to risk appetite, policies and standards. we also regularly update risk assessments and review risk exposures. through our monitoring, we know our level of risk relative to limits and can take action in a timely manner. we also know when risk limits are breached and have processes to appropriately report and escalate exceptions. this includes timely requests for approval to managers and alerts to executive management, management-level committees or the board (directly or through an appropriate committee).
control - we establish and communicate risk limits and controls through policies, standards, procedures and processes. the limits and controls can be adjusted by senior management or the board when conditions or risk tolerances warrant. these limits may be absolute (e.g., loan amount, trading volume, operational loss) or relative (e.g., percentage of loan book in higher-risk categories). our flus are held accountable for performing within the established limits.
the formal processes used to manage risk represent a part of our overall risk management process. we instill a strong and comprehensive culture of managing risk well through communications, training, policies, procedures and organizational roles and responsibilities. establishing a culture reflective of our purpose to help make our customers' financial lives better and delivering on responsible growth is also critical to effective risk management. we are committed to the highest principles of ethical and professional conduct. conduct risk is the risk of improper actions, behaviors or practices by the corporation, its employees or representatives that are illegal, unethical and/or contrary to our core values that could result in harm to the corporation, our shareholders or our customers, damage the integrity of the financial markets, or negatively impact our reputation. we have established protocols and structures so that conduct risk is governed and reported across the corporation appropriately. all employees are held accountable for adhering to the code of conduct, operating within our risk appetite and managing risk in their daily business activities. in addition, our performance management and compensation practices encourage responsible risk-taking that is consistent with our risk framework and risk appetite.
corporation-wide stress testing integral to our capital planning, financial planning and strategic planning processes, we conduct capital scenario management and stress forecasting on a periodic basis to better understand balance sheet, earnings and capital sensitivities to certain economic and business scenarios, including economic and market conditions that are more severe than anticipated. these stress forecasts provide an understanding of the potential impacts from our risk profile on the balance sheet, earnings and capital, and serve as a key component of our capital and risk management practices. the intent of stress testing is to develop a comprehensive understanding of potential impacts of on- and off-balance sheet risks at the corporation and certain subsidiaries and how they impact financial resiliency, which provides confidence to management, regulators and our investors.
contingency planning we have developed and maintain contingency plans that are designed to prepare us in advance to respond in the event of bank of america potential adverse economic, financial or market stress. these contingency plans include our capital contingency plan and financial contingency and recovery plan, which provide monitoring, escalation, actions and routines designed to enable us to increase capital, access funding sources and reduce risk through consideration of potential options that include asset sales, business sales, capital or debt issuances, and other de-risking strategies. we also maintain a resolution plan to limit adverse systemic impacts that could be associated with a potential resolution of bank of america.
strategic risk management strategic risk is embedded in every business and is one of the major risk categories along with credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. this risk results from incorrect assumptions about external or internal factors, inappropriate business plans, ineffective business strategy execution, or failure to respond in a timely manner to changes in the regulatory, macroeconomic or competitive environments in the geographic locations in which we operate, such as competitor actions, changing customer preferences, product obsolescence and technology developments.
an aspect of strategic risk is the risk that the corporation's capital levels are not adequate to meet minimum regulatory requirements and support execution of business activities or absorb losses from risks during normal or adverse economic and market conditions. as such, capital risk is managed in parallel to strategic risk.
we manage strategic risk through the strategic risk enterprise policy and integration into the strategic planning process, among other activities. our strategic plan is consistent with our risk appetite, capital plan and liquidity requirements, and specifically addresses strategic risks impacting each business.
on an annual basis, the board reviews and approves the strategic plan, capital plan, financial operating plan and risk appetite statement. with oversight by the board, senior management directs the lines of business to execute our strategic plan consistent with our core operating principles and risk appetite. the executive management team monitors business performance throughout the year and provides the board with regular progress reports on whether strategic objectives and timelines are being met, including reports on strategic risks and if additional or alternative actions need to be considered or implemented. the regular executive reviews focus on assessing forecasted earnings and returns on capital, the current risk profile, current capital and liquidity requirements, staffing levels and changes required to support the strategic plan, stress testing results, and other qualitative factors such as market growth rates and peer analysis.
significant strategic actions, such as capital actions, material acquisitions or divestitures, and resolution plans are reviewed and approved by the board. at the business level, processes are in place to discuss the strategic risk implications of new, expanded or modified businesses, products or services and other strategic initiatives, and to provide formal review and approval where required. with oversight by the board and the erc, executive management performs similar analyses throughout the year, and evaluates changes to the financial forecast or the risk, capital or liquidity positions as deemed appropriate to balance and optimize achieving the targeted risk appetite, shareholder returns and maintaining the targeted financial strength. proprietary models are used to measure the capital requirements for credit, country, market, operational and strategic risks. the allocated capital assigned to each business is based on its unique risk profile. with oversight by the board, executive management assesses the risk-adjusted returns of each business in approving strategic and financial operating plans. the businesses use allocated capital to define business strategies, and price products and transactions.
capital management the corporation manages its capital position so that its capital is more than adequate to support its business activities and aligns with risk, risk appetite and strategic planning. additionally, we seek to maintain safety and soundness at all times, even under adverse scenarios, take advantage of organic growth opportunities, meet obligations to creditors and counterparties, maintain ready access to financial markets, continue to serve as a credit intermediary, remain a source of strength for our subsidiaries, and satisfy current and future regulatory capital requirements. capital management is integrated into our risk and governance processes, as capital is a key consideration in the development of our strategic plan, risk appetite and risk limits.
we conduct an internal capital adequacy assessment process (icaap) on a periodic basis. the icaap is a forward-looking assessment of our projected capital needs and resources, incorporating earnings, balance sheet and risk forecasts under baseline and adverse economic and market conditions. we utilize periodic stress tests to assess the potential impacts to our balance sheet, earnings, regulatory capital and liquidity under a variety of stress scenarios. we perform qualitative risk assessments to identify and assess material risks not fully captured in our forecasts or stress tests. we assess the potential capital impacts of proposed changes to regulatory capital requirements. management assesses icaap results and provides documented quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our capital guidelines and capital position to the board or its committees.
we periodically review capital allocated to our businesses and allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. for more information, see business segment operations on page 37.
ccar and capital planning the federal reserve requires bhcs to submit a capital plan and planned capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing the comprehensive capital analysis and review (ccar) capital plan. based on the results of our 2022 ccar stress test, our stress capital buffer (scb) increased to 3.4 percent from 2.5 percent, effective october 1, 2022 through september 30, 2023.
in october 2021, the board authorized the corporation's $25 billion common stock repurchase program. additionally, the board authorized common stock repurchases to offset shares awarded under the corporation's equity-based compensation plans. pursuant to the board's authorizations, during 2022, we repurchased $5.1 billion of common stock, including repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans.
the timing and amount of common stock repurchases are subject to various factors, including the corporation's capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price, regulatory requirements and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time. such repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including repurchase plans that satisfy the conditions of rule 10b5-1 of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (exchange act).
bank of america regulatory capital as a financial services holding company, we are subject to regulatory capital rules, including basel 3, issued by u.s. banking regulators. basel 3 established minimum capital ratios and buffer requirements and outlined two methods of calculating risk-weighted assets (rwa), the standardized approach and the advanced approaches. the standardized approach relies primarily on supervisory risk weights based on exposure type, and the advanced approaches determine risk weights based on internal models.
the corporation's depository institution subsidiaries are also subject to the prompt corrective action (pca) framework. the corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, bana, are advanced approaches institutions under basel 3 and are required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and rwa under both the standardized and advanced approaches. the lower of the capital ratios under standardized or advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements are used to assess capital adequacy, including under the pca framework. as of december 31, 2022, the common equity tier 1 (cet1), tier 1 capital and total capital ratios under the standardized approach were the binding ratios.
minimum capital requirements in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments, the corporation must meet risk-based capital ratio requirements that include a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent (under the advanced approaches only), an scb (under the standardized approach only), plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer and a global systemically important bank (g-sib) surcharge. the buffers and surcharge must be comprised solely of cet1 capital. for the period from october 1, 2021 through september 30, 2022, the corporation's minimum cet1 capital ratio requirement was 9.5 percent under both the standardized and advanced approaches. based on the results of our 2022 ccar stress test, the corporation's scb increased to 3.4 percent, resulting in a minimum cet1 capital ratio requirement of 10.4 percent under the standardized approach for the period from october 1, 2022 through september 30, 2023. our minimum cet1 capital ratio requirement under the advanced approaches remains unchanged at 9.5 percent.
the corporation is required to calculate its g-sib surcharge on an annual basis under two methods and is subject to the higher of the resulting two surcharges. method 1 is consistent with the approach prescribed by the basel committee's assessment methodology and is calculated using specified indicators of systemic importance. method 2 modifies the method 1 approach by, among other factors, including a measure of the corporation's reliance on short-term wholesale funding. the corporation's g-sib surcharge, which is higher under method 2, is expected to increase to 3.0 percent from 2.5 percent on january 1, 2024, which will increase our minimum cet1 capital ratio requirement. at december 31, 2022, the corporation's cet1 capital ratio of 11.2 percent under the standardized approach exceeded its current cet1 capital ratio requirement as well as the minimum requirement expected to be in place as of january 1, 2024 due to an anticipated increase in our g-sib surcharge.
the corporation is also required to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (slr) of 3.0 percent plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. our insured depository institution subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent slr to be considered well capitalized under the pca framework. the numerator of the slr is quarter-end basel 3 tier 1 capital. the denominator is total leverage exposure based on the daily average of the sum of on-balance sheet exposures less permitted deductions, and applicable temporary exclusions, as well as the simple average of certain off-balance sheet exposures, as of the end of each month in a quarter.
capital composition and ratios table 10 presents bank of america corporation's capital ratios and related information in accordance with basel 3 standardized and advanced approaches as measured at december 31, 2022 and 2021. for the periods presented herein, the corporation met the definition of well capitalized under current regulatory requirements.

(2)the capital conservation buffer and g-sib surcharge were 2.5 percent at both december 31, 2022 and 2021. the corporation's scb applied in place of the capital conservation buffer under the standardized approach was 3.4 percent at december 31, 2022 and 2.5 percent at december 31, 2021. the countercyclical capital buffer for both periods was zero. the cet1 capital regulatory minimum is the sum of the cet1 capital ratio minimum of 4.5 percent, our g-sib surcharge of 2.5 percent and our capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent or the scb, as applicable, of 3.4 percent at december 31, 2022 and 2.5 percent at december 31, 2021. the slr regulatory minimum includes a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent.
(3)total capital under the advanced approaches differs from the standardized approach due to differences in the amount permitted in tier 2 capital related to the qualifying allowance for credit losses.
(4)reflects total average assets adjusted for certain tier 1 capital deductions.
at december 31, 2022, cet1 capital was $180.1 billion, an increase of $8.3 billion from december 31, 2021, due to earnings, partially offset by dividends, common stock repurchases and higher net unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities included in accumulated other comprehensive income (oci). tier 1 capital increased $12.0 billion primarily driven by the same factors as cet1 capital as well as non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock issuances. total capital under the standardized approach increased $11.2 billion primarily due to the same factors driving the increase in tier 1 capital and an increase in the adjusted allowance for credit losses included in tier 2 capital, partially offset by a decrease in subordinated debt. rwa under the standardized approach, which yielded the lower cet1 capital ratio at december 31, 2022, decreased $13.0 billion during 2022 to $1,605 billion primarily due to lower counterparty exposures in global markets and a decrease in debt securities in the treasury portfolio, partially offset by loan growth. supplementary leverage exposure at december 31, 2022 decreased $80.3 billion primarily due to lower debt securities, driven by lower deposits, partially offset by loan growth.

regulatory capital and securities regulation the corporation's principal u.s. broker-dealer subsidiaries are bofa securities, inc. (bofas), merrill lynch professional clearing corp. (mlpcc) and merrill lynch, pierce, fenner & smith incorporated (mlpf&s). the corporation's principal european broker-dealer subsidiaries are merrill lynch international (mli) and bofa securities europe sa (bofase).
the u.s. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the net capital requirements of rule 15c3-1 under the exchange act. bofas computes its minimum capital requirements as an alternative net capital broker-dealer under rule 15c3-1e, and mlpcc and mlpf&s compute their minimum capital requirements in accordance with the alternative standard under rule 15c3-1. bofas and mlpcc are also registered as futures commission merchants and are subject to commodity futures trading commission (cftc) regulation 1.17. the u.s. broker-dealer subsidiaries are also registered with the financial industry regulatory authority, inc. (finra). pursuant to finra rule 4110, finra may impose higher net capital requirements than rule 15c3-1 under the exchange act with respect to each of the broker-dealers.
bofas provides institutional services, and in accordance with the alternative net capital requirements, is required to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $5.0 billion and net capital in excess of the greater of $1.0 billion or a certain percentage of its reserve requirement in addition to a certain percentage of securities-based swap risk margin. bofas must also notify the sec in the event its tentative net capital is less than $6.0 billion. bofas is also required to hold a certain percentage of its customers' and affiliates' risk-based margin in order to meet its cftc minimum net capital requirement. at december 31, 2022, bofas had tentative net capital of $20.9 billion. bofas also had regulatory net capital of $17.5 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement of $4.1 billion.
mlpcc is a fully-guaranteed subsidiary of bofas and provides clearing and settlement services as well as prime brokerage and arranged financing services for institutional clients. at december 31, 2022, mlpcc's regulatory net capital of $7.5 billion exceeded the minimum requirement of $1.4 billion.
mlpf&s provides retail services. at december 31, 2022, mlpf&s' regulatory net capital was $6.0 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement of $137 million.
our european broker-dealers are subject to requirements from u.s. and non-u.s. regulators. mli, a u.k. investment firm, is regulated by the prudential regulation authority and the financial conduct authority and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. at december 31, 2022, mli's capital resources were $33.4 billion, which exceeded the minimum pillar 1 requirement of $11.6 billion.
bofase is an authorized credit institution with its head office located in france. previously, bofase had been authorized as an investment firm, but following the european union's adoption of the harmonized investment firm directive and investment firm regulation prudential regime, it was required to apply for reauthorization as a credit institution. the application was approved in november 2022 and became effective on december 8, 2022. bofase is authorized and regulated by the autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution and the autorité des marchés financiers, and supervised under the single supervisory mechanism by the european central bank. at december 31, 2022, bofase's capital resources were $9.0 billion, which exceeded the minimum pillar 1 requirement of $3.0 billion.
in addition, mli and bofase became conditionally registered with the sec as security-based swap dealers in the fourth quarter of 2021, and maintained net liquid assets at december 31, 2022 that exceeded the applicable minimum requirements under the exchange act.
liquidity risk funding and liquidity risk management our primary liquidity risk management objective is to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral requirements, including payments under long-term debt agreements, commitments to extend credit and customer deposit withdrawals, while continuing to support our businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions. to achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk under expected and stressed conditions, maintain liquidity and access to diverse funding sources, including our stable deposit base, and seek to align liquidity-related incentives and risks. these liquidity risk management practices have allowed us to effectively manage the market fluctuation from the rising interest rate environment, inflationary pressures and macroeconomic environment.
we define liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations as they arise. we manage our liquidity position through line-of-business and alm activities, as well as through our legal entity funding strategy, on both a forward and current bank of america
(including intraday) basis under both expected and stressed conditions. we believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity management enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events.
the board approves our liquidity risk policy and the financial contingency and recovery plan. the erc establishes our liquidity risk tolerance levels. the mrc is responsible for overseeing liquidity risks and directing management to maintain exposures within the established tolerance levels. the mrc reviews and monitors our liquidity position and stress testing results, approves certain liquidity risk limits and reviews the impact of strategic decisions on our liquidity. for more information, see managing risk on page 46. under this governance framework, we developed certain funding and liquidity risk management practices which include: maintaining liquidity at bank of america corporation (parent) and selected subsidiaries, including our bank subsidiaries and other regulated entities; determining what amounts of liquidity are appropriate for these entities based on analysis of debt maturities and other potential cash outflows, including those that we may experience during stressed market conditions; diversifying funding sources, considering our asset profile and legal entity structure; and performing contingency planning.
nb holdings corporation the parent, which is a separate and distinct legal entity from our bank and nonbank subsidiaries, has an intercompany arrangement with our wholly-owned holding company subsidiary, nb holdings corporation (nb holdings). we have transferred, and agreed to transfer, additional parent assets not required to satisfy anticipated near-term expenditures to nb holdings. the parent is expected to continue to have access to the same flow of dividends, interest and other amounts of cash necessary to service its debt, pay dividends and perform other obligations as it would have had it not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets. these arrangements support our preferred single point of entry resolution strategy, under which only the parent would be resolved under the u.s. bankruptcy code.
in consideration for the transfer of assets, nb holdings issued a subordinated note to the parent in a principal amount equal to the value of the transferred assets. the aggregate principal amount of the note will increase by the amount of any future asset transfers. nb holdings also provided the parent with a committed line of credit that allows the parent to draw funds necessary to service near-term cash needs. these arrangements support our preferred single point of entry resolution strategy, under which only the parent would be resolved under the u.s. bankruptcy code. these arrangements include provisions to terminate the line of credit, forgive the subordinated note and require the parent to transfer its remaining financial assets to nb holdings if our projected liquidity resources deteriorate so severely that resolution of the parent becomes imminent.
global liquidity sources and other unencumbered assets we maintain liquidity available to the corporation, including the parent and selected subsidiaries, in the form of cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. our liquidity buffer, referred to as global liquidity sources (gls), is comprised of assets that are readily available to the parent and selected subsidiaries, including holding company, bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, even during stressed market conditions. our cash is primarily on deposit with the federal reserve bank and, to a lesser extent, central banks outside of the u.s. we limit the composition of high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities to u.s. government securities, u.s. agency securities, u.s. agency mbs and other investment-grade securities, and a select group of non-u.s. government securities. we can obtain cash for these securities, even in stressed conditions, through repurchase agreements or outright sales. we hold our gls in legal entities that allow us to meet the liquidity requirements of our global businesses, and we consider the impact of potential regulatory, tax, legal and other restrictions that could limit the transferability of funds among entities.
table 15 presents average gls for the three months ended december 31, 2022 and 2021.

(1) nonbank includes parent, nb holdings and other regulated entities.
our bank subsidiaries' liquidity is primarily driven by deposit and lending activity, as well as securities valuation and net debt activity. bank subsidiaries can also generate incremental liquidity by pledging a range of unencumbered loans and securities to certain fhlbs and the federal reserve discount window. the cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically-identified eligible assets was $348 billion and $322 billion at december 31, 2022 and 2021. we have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. eligibility is defined in guidelines from the fhlbs and the federal reserve and is subject to change at their discretion. due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can generally be used only to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries, and transfers to the parent or nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to prior regulatory approval.
liquidity is also held in nonbank entities, including the parent, nb holdings and other regulated entities. the parent and nb holdings liquidity is typically in the form of cash deposited at bana, which is excluded from the liquidity at bank subsidiaries, and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. liquidity held in other regulated entities, comprised primarily of broker-dealer subsidiaries, is primarily available to meet the obligations of that entity, and transfers to the parent or to any other subsidiary may be subject to prior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements. our other regulated entities also hold unencumbered investment-grade securities and equities that we believe could be used to generate additional liquidity.

our gls are substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as high quality liquid assets (hqla) under the final u.s. liquidity coverage ratio (lcr) rules. however, hqla for purposes of calculating lcr is not reported at market value, but at a lower value that incorporates regulatory deductions and the exclusion of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries. the lcr is calculated as the amount of a financial institution's unencumbered hqla relative to the estimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period of significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. our average consolidated hqla, on a net basis, was $605 billion and $617 billion for the three months ended december 31, 2022 and 2021. for the same periods, the average consolidated lcr was 120 percent and 115 percent. our lcr fluctuates due to normal business flows from customer activity.
liquidity stress analysis we utilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the parent and our subsidiaries to meet contractual and contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios. the scenarios we consider and utilize incorporate market-wide and corporation-specific events, including potential credit rating downgrades for the parent and our subsidiaries, and more severe events including potential resolution scenarios. the scenarios are based on our historical experience, experience of distressed and failed financial institutions, regulatory guidance, and both expected and unexpected future events.
the types of potential contractual and contingent cash outflows we consider in our scenarios may include, but are not limited to, upcoming contractual maturities of unsecured debt and reductions in new debt issuances; diminished access to secured financing markets; potential deposit withdrawals; increased draws on loan commitments, liquidity facilities and letters of credit; additional collateral that counterparties could call if our credit ratings were downgraded; collateral and margin requirements arising from market value changes; and potential liquidity required to maintain businesses and finance customer activities. changes in certain market factors, including, but not limited to, credit rating downgrades, could negatively impact potential contractual and contingent outflows and the related financial instruments, and in some cases these impacts could be material to our financial results.
we consider all sources of funds that we could access during each stress scenario and focus particularly on matching available sources with corresponding liquidity requirements by legal entity. we also use the stress modeling results to manage our asset and liability profile and establish limits and guidelines on certain funding sources and businesses.
net stable funding ratio the net stable funding ratio (nsfr) is a liquidity requirement for large banks to maintain a minimum level of stable funding over a one-year period. the requirement is intended to support the ability of banks to lend to households and businesses in both normal and adverse economic conditions and is complementary to the lcr, which focuses on short-term liquidity risks. the u.s. nsfr applies to the corporation on a consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions. at december 31, 2022, the corporation and its insured depository institutions were in compliance with this requirement.
diversified funding sources we fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits, and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated funding approach diversified across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups.
the primary benefits of our centralized funding approach include greater control, reduced funding costs, wider name recognition by investors and greater flexibility to meet the variable funding requirements of subsidiaries. where regulations, time zone differences or other business considerations make parent funding impractical, certain other subsidiaries may issue their own debt.
we fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits, which were $1.93 trillion and $2.1 trillion at december 31, 2022 and 2021. deposits are primarily generated by our consumer banking, gwim and global banking segments. these deposits are diversified by clients, product type and geography, and the majority of our u.s. deposits are insured by the fdic. we consider a substantial portion of our deposits to be a stable, low-cost and consistent source of funding. we believe this deposit funding is generally less sensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility or changes in our credit ratings than wholesale funding sources. our lending activities may also be financed through secured borrowings, including credit card securitizations and securitizations with government-sponsored enterprises (gse), the federal housing administration (fha) and private-label investors, as well as fhlb loans.
our trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements, and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions. we believe funding these activities in the secured financing markets is more cost-efficient and less sensitive to changes in our credit ratings than unsecured financing. repurchase agreements are generally short-term and often overnight. disruptions in secured financing markets for financial institutions have occurred in prior market cycles which resulted in adverse changes in terms or significant reductions in the availability of such financing. we manage the liquidity risks arising from secured funding by sourcing funding globally from a diverse group of counterparties, providing a range of securities collateral and pursuing longer durations, when appropriate. for more information on secured financing agreements, see note 10 - securities financing agreements, short-term borrowings, collateral and restricted cash to the consolidated financial statements.
total long-term debt decreased $4.1 billion to $276.0 billion during 2022 primarily due to debt maturities, redemptions and valuation adjustments, partially offset by debt issuances. we may, from time to time, purchase outstanding debt instruments in various transactions, depending on market conditions, liquidity and other factors. our other regulated entities may also make markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for investors.
during 2022, we issued $66.0 billion of long-term debt consisting of $44.2 billion of notes issued by bank of america corporation, substantially all of which were tlac compliant, bank of america
$10.0 billion of notes issued by bank of america, n.a. and $11.8 billion of other debt. during 2021, we issued $76.7 billion of long-term debt consisting of $56.2 billion of notes issued by bank of america corporation, substantially all of which were tlac compliant, $8 billion of notes issued by bank of america, n.a. and $12.5 billion of other debt.
during 2022, we had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the aggregate of $33.3 billion consisting of $19.8 billion for bank of america corporation, $9.9 billion for bank of america, n.a. and $3.6 billion of other debt. during 2021, we had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the aggregate of $46.4 billion consisting of $24.4 billion for bank of america corporation, $10.4 billion for bank of america, n.a. and $11.6 billion of other debt.
at december 31, 2022, bank of america corporation's senior notes of $205.9 billion included $179.1 billion of outstanding notes that are both tlac eligible and callable at least one year before their stated maturities. of these senior notes, $16.6 billion will be callable and become tlac ineligible during 2023, and $21.4 billion, $21.3 billion, $16.0 billion and $24.4 billion will do so during each of 2024 through 2027, respectively, and $79.4 billion thereafter.
we issue long-term unsecured debt in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve cost-efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity profile. while the cost and availability of unsecured funding may be negatively impacted by general market conditions or by matters specific to the financial services industry or the corporation, we seek to mitigate refinancing risk by actively managing the amount of our borrowings that we anticipate will mature within any month or quarter. we may issue unsecured debt in the form of structured notes for client purposes, certain of which qualify as tlac-eligible debt. during 2022, we issued $12.5 billion of structured notes, which are debt obligations that pay investors returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. we typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivatives and/or investments in the underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. we could be required to settle certain structured note obligations for cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. we believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date.
substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price. for more information on long-term debt funding, including issuances and maturities and redemptions, see note 11 - long-term debt to the consolidated financial statements.
we use derivative transactions to manage the duration, interest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the characteristics of the assets they are funding. for more information on our alm activities, see interest rate risk management for the banking book on page 79.
uninsured deposits the fdic insures the corporation's u.s. deposits up to $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank for each account ownership category, and various country-specific funds insure non-u.s. deposits up to specified limits. deposits that exceed insurance limits are uninsured. at december 31, 2022, the corporation's deposits totaled $1.9 trillion, of which total estimated uninsured u.s. and non-u.s. deposits were $617.6 billion and $102.8 billion. at december 31, 2021, the corporation's deposits totaled $2.1 trillion, of which total estimated uninsured u.s. and non-u.s. deposits were $701.4 billion and $111.9 billion.

contingency planning we maintain contingency funding plans that outline our potential responses to liquidity stress events at various levels of severity. these policies and plans are based on stress scenarios and include potential funding strategies and communication and notification procedures that we would implement in the event we experienced stressed liquidity conditions. we periodically review and test the contingency funding plans to validate efficacy and assess readiness.
our u.s. bank subsidiaries can access contingency funding through the federal reserve discount window. certain non-u.s. subsidiaries have access to central bank facilities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. while we do not rely on these sources in our liquidity modeling, we maintain the policies, procedures and governance processes that would enable us to access these sources if necessary.
credit ratings our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are impacted by our credit ratings. in addition, credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions, including over-the-counter (otc) derivatives. thus, it is our objective to maintain high-quality credit ratings, and management maintains an active dialogue with the major rating agencies.
credit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities, including asset securitizations. our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies, and they consider a number of factors, including our own financial strength, performance, prospects and operations as well as factors not under our control. the rating agencies could make adjustments to our ratings at any bank of america time, and they provide no assurances that they will maintain our ratings at current levels.
other factors that influence our credit ratings include changes to the rating agencies' methodologies for our industry or certain security types; the rating agencies' assessment of the general operating environment for financial services companies; our relative positions in the markets in which we compete; our various risk exposures and risk management policies and activities; pending litigation and other contingencies or potential tail risks; our reputation; our liquidity position, diversity of funding sources and funding costs; the current and expected level and volatility of our earnings; our capital position and capital management practices; our corporate governance; the sovereign credit ratings of the u.s. government; current or future regulatory and legislative initiatives; and the agencies' views on whether the u.s. government would provide meaningful support to the corporation or its subsidiaries in a crisis.
on september 19, 2022, fitch ratings (fitch) affirmed the long-term and short-term senior debt ratings of the corporation. fitch also affirmed and withdrew the long-term and short-term ratings on certain subsidiaries, as they are no longer considered relevant to the agency's coverage.
on january 23, 2023, moody's investors service (moody's) placed the long-term rating of the corporation as well as the long-term rating of its rated subsidiaries, including bana, on review for upgrade. the agency cited the corporation's strengthened capital ratios, improved earnings profile and continued commitment to maintaining a restrained risk appetite as drivers of the review. a review for upgrade indicates that those ratings are under consideration for a change in the near term and typically concludes within 90 days. moody's concurrently affirmed all prime-1 short-term ratings of the corporation and rated subsidiaries.
the current ratings and outlooks for the corporation and its subsidiaries from standard & poor's global ratings (s&p) were not the subject of any rating actions during 2022 or through february 22, 2023.

while certain potential impacts are contractual and quantifiable, the full scope of the consequences of a credit rating downgrade to a financial institution is inherently uncertain, as it depends upon numerous dynamic, complex and inter-related factors and assumptions, including whether any downgrade of a company's long-term credit ratings precipitates downgrades to its short-term credit ratings, and assumptions about the potential behaviors of various customers, investors and counterparties. for more information on potential impacts of credit rating downgrades, see liquidity risk - liquidity stress analysis on page 56.

finance subsidiary issuers and parent guarantor bofa finance llc, a delaware limited liability company (bofa finance), is a consolidated finance subsidiary of the corporation that has issued and sold, and is expected to continue to issue and sell, its senior unsecured debt securities (guaranteed notes) that are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the corporation. the corporation guarantees the due and punctual payment, on demand, of amounts payable on the guaranteed notes if not paid by bofa finance. in addition, each of bac capital trust xiii, bac capital trust xiv and bac capital trust xv, delaware statutory trusts (collectively, the trusts), is a 100 percent owned finance subsidiary of the corporation that has issued and sold trust preferred securities (the trust preferred bank of america securities) or capital securities (the capital securities and, together with the guaranteed notes and the trust preferred securities, the guaranteed securities), as applicable, that remained outstanding at december 31, 2022. the corporation guarantees the payment of amounts and distributions with respect to the trust preferred securities and capital securities if not paid by the trusts, to the extent of funds held by the trusts, and this guarantee, together with the corporation's other obligations with respect to the trust preferred securities and capital securities, effectively constitutes a full and unconditional guarantee of the trusts' payment obligations on the trust preferred securities or capital securities, as applicable. no other subsidiary of the corporation guarantees the guaranteed securities.
bofa finance and each of the trusts are finance subsidiaries, have no independent assets, revenues or operations and are dependent upon the corporation and/or the corporation's other subsidiaries to meet their respective obligations under the guaranteed securities in the ordinary course. if holders of the guaranteed securities make claims on their guaranteed securities in a bankruptcy, resolution or similar proceeding, any recoveries on those claims will be limited to those available under the applicable guarantee by the corporation, as described above.
the corporation is a holding company and depends upon its subsidiaries for liquidity. applicable laws and regulations and intercompany arrangements entered into in connection with the corporation's resolution plan could restrict the availability of funds from subsidiaries to the corporation, which could adversely affect the corporation's ability to make payments under its guarantees. in addition, the obligations of the corporation under the guarantees of the guaranteed securities will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of its subsidiaries, and claimants should look only to assets of the corporation for payments. if the corporation, as guarantor of the guaranteed notes, transfers all or substantially all of its assets to one or more direct or indirect majority-owned subsidiaries, under the indenture governing the guaranteed notes, the subsidiary or subsidiaries will not be required to assume the corporation's obligations under its guarantee of the guaranteed notes.
for more information on factors that may affect payments to holders of the guaranteed securities, see liquidity risk - nb holdings corporation in this section, item 1. business - insolvency and the orderly liquidation authority on page 6 and part i. item 1a. risk factors - liquidity on page 9.

credit risk management credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability or failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its obligations. credit risk can also arise from operational failures that result in an erroneous advance, commitment or investment of funds. we define the credit exposure to a borrower or counterparty as the loss potential arising from all product classifications including loans and leases, deposit overdrafts, derivatives, assets held-for-sale and unfunded lending commitments, which include loan commitments, letters of credit and financial guarantees. derivative positions are recorded at fair value, and assets held-for-sale are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value. certain loans and unfunded commitments are accounted for under the fair value option. credit risk for categories of assets carried at fair value is not accounted for as part of the allowance for credit losses but as part of the fair value adjustments recorded in earnings. for derivative positions, our credit risk is measured as the net cost in the event the counterparties with contracts in which we are in a gain position fail to perform under the terms of those contracts. we use the current fair value to represent credit exposure without giving consideration to future mark-to-market changes. the credit risk amounts take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral. our consumer and commercial credit extension and review procedures encompass funded and unfunded credit exposures. for more information on derivatives and credit extension commitments, see note 3 - derivatives and note 12 - commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements.
we manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower or counterparty, repayment sources, the nature of underlying collateral and other support given current events, conditions and expectations. we classify our portfolios as either consumer or commercial and monitor credit risk in each as discussed below.
we refine our underwriting and credit risk management practices as well as credit standards to meet the changing economic environment. to mitigate losses and enhance customer support in our consumer businesses, we have in place collection programs and loan modification and customer assistance infrastructures. we utilize a number of actions to mitigate losses in the commercial businesses including increasing the frequency and intensity of portfolio monitoring, hedging activity and our practice of transferring management of deteriorating commercial exposures to independent special asset officers as credits enter criticized categories.
during 2022, asset quality generally improved compared to 2021. our 2022 net charge-off ratio remained near historic lows, and nonperforming loans and commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure decreased compared to 2021, which was partially offset by an increase in reservable criticized exposure associated with our direct exposure to russia as a result of the russia/ukraine conflict. while uncertainty around the pandemic has diminished, uncertainty remains regarding broader economic impacts as a result of inflationary pressures, rising rates and the current geopolitical situation and could lead to adverse impacts to credit quality metrics in future periods.

consumer portfolio credit risk management credit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower's credit cycle. statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns. statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external bank of america sources, such as credit bureaus, and/or internal historical experience and are a component of our consumer credit risk management process. these models are used in part to assist in making both new and ongoing credit decisions as well as portfolio management strategies, including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, and determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allocated capital for credit risk.
consumer credit portfolio during 2022, the u.s. unemployment rate continued to decline and home prices increased compared to 2021, although they began to decline in the second half of 2022 as inflationary pressures continued to persist. during 2022, net charge-offs were $1.9 billion, relatively unchanged compared to 2021. during 2022, nonperforming loans declined primarily due to decreases from consumer real estate loan sales, partially offset by increases from loans whose prior-period deferrals expired and were modified in troubled debt restructurings (tdrs) during the first quarter of 2022.
the consumer allowance for loan and lease losses increased $204 million during 2022 to $7.2 billion. for more information, see allowance for credit losses on page 73.

nonperforming outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio decreased $117 million in 2022 primarily due to decreases from consumer real estate loan sales in the second quarter of 2022, partially offset by increases from loans whose prior-period deferrals expired and were modified in tdrs during the first quarter of 2022. of the nonperforming residential mortgage loans at december 31, 2022, $1.4 billion, or 63 percent, were current on contractual payments. loans accruing past due 30 days or more decreased $22 million.
net charge-offs of $72 million for 2022 increased $100 million compared to 2021 primarily due to loan sales that occurred in the second quarter of 2022.
of the $218.0 billion in total residential mortgage loans outstanding at december 31, 2022, 28 percent were originated as interest-only loans. the outstanding balance of interest-only residential mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period was $3.4 billion, or six percent, at december 31, 2022. residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period generally experience a higher rate of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status compared to the residential mortgage portfolio as a whole. at december 31, 2022, $64 million, or two percent, of outstanding interest-only residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $844 million, or less than one percent, for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. in addition, at december 31, 2022, $204 million, or six percent, of outstanding interest-only residential mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $79 million were contractually current. loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only residential mortgage portfolio are primarily well-collateralized loans to our wealth management clients and have an interest-only period of three to ten years. approximately 96 percent of these loans that have yet to enter the amortization period will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2025 or later.

nonperforming outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $120 million to $510 million at december 31, 2022, primarily driven by loan sales. of the nonperforming home equity loans at december 31, 2022, $275 million, or 54 percent, were current on contractual payments. in addition, $167 million, or 33 percent, of nonperforming home equity loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. accruing loans that were 30 days or more past due decreased $61 million in 2022.
net recoveries decreased $29 million to $90 million in 2022 compared to 2021.
of the $26.6 billion in total home equity portfolio outstandings at december 31, 2022, as shown in table 23, 13 percent require interest-only payments. the outstanding balance of helocs that had reached the end of their draw period and entered the amortization period was $5.2 billion at december 31, 2022. the helocs that have entered the amortization period have experienced a higher percentage of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status when compared to the heloc portfolio as a whole. at december 31, 2022, $53 million, or one percent, of outstanding helocs that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more. in addition, at december 31, 2022, $354 million, or seven percent, were nonperforming.
for our interest-only heloc portfolio, we do not actively track how many of our home equity customers pay only the minimum amount due on their home equity loans and lines; however, we can infer some of this information through a review of our heloc portfolio that we service and is still in its revolving period. during 2022, 10 percent of these customers with an outstanding balance did not pay any principal on their helocs.
table 24 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances and net recoveries by certain state concentrations for the home equity portfolio. in the new york area, the new york-northern new jersey-long island msa made up 12 percent and 13 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at december 31, 2022 and 2021. the los angeles-long beach-santa ana msa within california made up 11 percent and 10 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at december 31, 2022 and 2021.

in addition to modifying consumer real estate loans, we work with customers who are experiencing financial difficulty by modifying credit card and other consumer loans. credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve a reduction in the customer's interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months.
modifications of credit card and other consumer loans are made through programs utilizing direct customer contact, but may also utilize external programs. at december 31, 2022 and 2021, our credit card and other consumer tdr portfolio was $624 million and $672 million, of which $540 million and $599 million were current or less than 30 days past due under the modified terms.
commercial portfolio credit risk management credit risk management for the commercial portfolio begins with an assessment of the credit risk profile of the borrower or counterparty based on an analysis of its financial position. as part of the overall credit risk assessment, our commercial credit exposures are assigned a risk rating and are subject to approval based on defined credit approval standards. subsequent to loan origination, risk ratings are monitored on an ongoing basis, and if necessary, adjusted to reflect changes in the financial condition, cash flow, risk profile or outlook of a borrower or counterparty. in making credit decisions, we consider risk rating, collateral, country, industry and single-name concentration limits while also balancing these considerations with the total borrower or counterparty relationship. we use a variety of tools to continuously monitor the ability of a borrower or counterparty to perform under its obligations. we use risk rating aggregations to measure and evaluate concentrations within portfolios. in addition, risk ratings are a factor in determining the level of allocated capital and the allowance for credit losses.
as part of our ongoing risk mitigation initiatives, we attempt to work with clients experiencing financial difficulty to modify their loans to terms that better align with their current ability to pay. in situations where an economic concession has been granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, we identify these loans as tdrs. for more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status and net charge-offs for the commercial portfolio, see note 1 - summary of significant accounting principles to the consolidated financial statements.
management of commercial credit risk concentrations commercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations of credit exposure continue to be aligned with our risk appetite. we review, measure and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship and loan size. we also review, measure and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type. in addition, within our non-u.s. portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by country. tables 33, 36 and 39 summarize our concentrations. we also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio. for more information on our industry concentrations, see table 36
bank of america 64
and commercial portfolio credit risk management - industry concentrations on page 68.
we account for certain large corporate loans and loan commitments, including issued but unfunded letters of credit which are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes, that exceed our single-name credit risk concentration guidelines under the fair value option. lending commitments, both funded and unfunded, are actively managed and monitored, and as appropriate, credit risk for these lending relationships may be mitigated through the use of credit derivatives, with our credit view and market perspectives determining the size and timing of the hedging activity. in addition, we purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain other credit exposures. to lessen the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, credit exposure may be added within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. these credit derivatives do not meet the requirements for treatment as accounting hedges. they are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income.
in addition, we are a member of various securities and derivative exchanges and clearinghouses, both in the u.s. and other countries. as a member, we may be required to pay a pro-rata share of the losses incurred by some of these organizations as a result of another member default and under other loss scenarios. for more information, see note 12 - commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements.
commercial credit portfolio during 2022, commercial credit quality improved as charge-offs, nonperforming commercial loans and reservable criticized utilized exposure declined. due to the ongoing russia/ukraine conflict, all direct exposure to russian counterparties was downgraded and reported as reservable criticized exposure, and expected credit losses (ecl) have been incorporated into our estimate of the allowance for credit losses. outstanding commercial loans and leases increased $45.9 billion during 2022 due to growth in commercial and industrial, primarily in global banking. this increase was partially offset by lower u.s. small business commercial loans due to repayments of ppp loans by the small business administration (sba) under the terms of the program.
credit quality of commercial real estate borrowers generally improved from 2021 as pandemic-impacted sectors are recovering. however, many commercial real estate markets, while improving, are still experiencing disruptions in demand, supply chain challenges, tenant difficulties and challenging capital markets. demand for office space continues to be uncertain as companies evaluate space needs with employment models that utilize a mix of remote and conventional office use.
the commercial allowance for loan and lease losses remained relatively unchanged at $5.4 billion at december 31, 2022, as loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic outlook were offset by asset quality improvement and a reserve release for reduced pandemic uncertainties. for more information, see allowance for credit losses on page 73.
total commercial utilized credit exposure increased $51.3 billion during 2022 to $704.9 billion primarily driven by higher loans and leases and derivative assets. the utilization rate for loans and leases, standby letters of credit (sblcs) and financial guarantees, and commercial letters of credit, in the aggregate, was 56 percent at both december 31, 2022 and 2021.
table 29 presents commercial credit exposure by type for utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure. commercial utilized credit exposure includes sblcs and financial guarantees and commercial letters of credit that have been issued and for which we are legally bound to advance funds under prescribed conditions during a specified time period, and excludes exposure related to trading account assets. although funds have not yet been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes.

industry concentrations table 36 presents commercial committed and utilized credit exposure by industry. our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. total commercial committed exposure increased $70.3 billion, or six percent, during 2022 to $1.2 trillion. the increase in commercial committed exposure was concentrated in asset managers and funds, global commercial banks and pharmaceuticals and biotechnology.
industry limits are used internally to manage industry concentrations and are based on committed exposure that is determined on an industry-by-industry basis. a risk management framework is in place to set and approve industry limits as well as to provide ongoing monitoring.
asset managers and funds, our largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $165.1 billion, increased $28.2 billion, or 21 percent, during 2022 primarily driven by investment-grade exposures.
real estate, our second largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $99.7 billion, increased $3.5 billion, or four percent, during 2022. for more information on the commercial real estate and related portfolios, see commercial portfolio credit risk management - commercial real estate on page 67.
capital goods, our third largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $87.3 billion, increased $3.0 billion, or four percent, during 2022. the increase in committed exposure occurred primarily as a result of increases in the electrical equipment and trading companies and distributors, partially offset by a decrease in building products.
while the u.s. and global economies have shown signs of relief from the pandemic, uncertainty remains as a result of bank of america 68
geopolitical and inflationary pressures, and a number of industries will likely continue to be adversely impacted due to these conditions. we continue to monitor all industries, particularly higher risk industries that are experiencing or could experience a more significant impact to their financial condition.

(1)includes u.s. small business commercial exposure.
(2)includes the notional amount of unfunded legally binding lending commitments, net of amounts distributed (i.e., syndicated or participated) to other financial institutions. the distributed amounts were $10.4 billion and $10.7 billion at december 31, 2022 and 2021.
(3)industries are viewed from a variety of perspectives to best isolate the perceived risks. for purposes of this table, the real estate industry is defined based on the primary business activity of the borrowers or counterparties using operating cash flows and primary source of repayment as key factors.
risk mitigation we purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. to lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, we may add credit exposure within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection.
at december 31, 2022 and 2021, net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was $9.0 billion and $2.6 billion. we recorded net losses of $37 million in 2022 compared to net losses $91 million in 2021. the gains and losses on these instruments were largely offset by gains and losses on the related exposures. the value-at-risk (var) results for these exposures are included in the fair value option portfolio information in table 43. for more information, see trading risk management on page 76.

in addition to our net notional credit default protection purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portion of certain credit exposures, credit derivatives are used for market-making activities for clients and establishing positions intended to profit from directional or relative value changes. we execute the majority of our credit derivative trades in the otc market with large, multinational financial institutions, including broker-dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of other investors. because these transactions are executed in the otc market, we are subject to settlement risk. we are also subject to credit risk in the event that these counterparties fail to perform under the terms of these contracts. in order to properly reflect counterparty credit risk, we record counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments on certain derivative assets, including our purchased credit default protection. in most cases, credit derivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis. therefore, events such as a credit downgrade, depending on the ultimate rating level, or a breach of credit covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral required by the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow us to take additional protective measures such as early termination of all trades. for more information on credit derivatives and counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments, see note 3 - derivatives to the consolidated financial statements.
non-u.s. portfolio our non-u.s. credit and trading portfolios are subject to country risk. we define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies. a risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor and manage non-u.s. risk and exposures. in addition to the direct risk of doing business in a country, we also are exposed to indirect country risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on secured financing transactions or related to client clearing activities). these indirect exposures are managed in the normal course of business through credit, market and operational risk governance rather than through country risk governance.
table 39 presents our 20 largest non-u.s. country exposures at december 31, 2022. these exposures accounted for 89 percent of our total non-u.s. exposure at both december 31, 2022 and 2021. net country exposure for these 20 countries increased $24.0 billion in 2022 primarily driven by increases in germany, japan, ireland, india and switzerland, partially offset by decreases in china, belgium, australia and singapore.
non-u.s. exposure is presented on an internal risk management basis and includes sovereign and non-sovereign credit exposure, securities and other investments issued by or domiciled in countries other than the u.s.
funded loans and loan equivalents include loans, leases, and other extensions of credit and funds, including letters of credit and due from placements. unfunded commitments are the undrawn portion of legally binding commitments related to loans and loan equivalents. net counterparty exposure includes the fair value of derivatives, including the counterparty risk associated with credit default swaps (cds), and secured financing transactions. securities and other investments are carried at fair value and long securities exposures are netted against short exposures with the same underlying issuer to, but not below, zero. net country exposure represents country exposure less hedges and credit default protection purchased, net of credit default protection sold.

our largest non-u.s. country exposure at december 31, 2022 was the united kingdom with net exposure of $55.3 billion, which represents an increase of $376 million from december 31, 2021. the increase was primarily driven by net counterparty exposure with financial institutions, partially offset by a reduction in deposits with the central bank. our second largest non-u.s. country exposure was germany with net exposure of $45.7 billion at december 31, 2022, an increase of $11.9 billion from december 31, 2021. the increase was driven by higher deposits with the central bank and increased exposure with financial institutions and corporates.

allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses increased $379 million from december 31, 2021 to $14.2 billion at december 31, 2022, which included a $202 million reserve increase related to the consumer portfolio and a $177 million reserve increase related to the commercial portfolio. the increase in the allowance was primarily driven by loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reserve release for reduced pandemic uncertainties.
table 41 presents an allocation of the allowance for credit losses by product type at december 31, 2022 and 2021.

(1)ratios are calculated as allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans and leases outstanding excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option.
(2)includes allowance for loan and lease losses for u.s. small business commercial loans of $844 million and $1.2 billion at december 31, 2022 and 2021.
n/m = not meaningful net charge-offs for both 2022 and 2021 were $2.2 billion as credit card losses, which remained near historic lows, were partially offset by higher overdrafts charged off in other consumer due to payment activity related to checking accounts. the provision for credit losses increased $7.1 billion to an expense of $2.5 billion during 2022 compared to 2021. the provision for credit losses in 2022 was primarily driven by loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reserve release for reduced pandemic uncertainties. the provision for credit losses for the consumer portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, increased $3.2 billion to an expense of $2.0 billion during 2022 compared to 2021. the provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, increased $3.9 billion to an expense of $495 million for 2022 compared to 2021.

bank of america market risk management market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions may adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities, or otherwise negatively impact earnings. this risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations, primarily within our global markets segment. we are also exposed to these risks in other areas of the corporation (e.g., our alm activities). in the event of market stress, these risks could have a material impact on our results. for more information, see interest rate risk management for the banking book on page 79.
our traditional banking loan and deposit products are non-trading positions and are generally reported at amortized cost for assets or the amount owed for liabilities (historical cost). however, these positions are still subject to changes in economic value based on varying market conditions, with one of the primary risks being changes in the levels of interest rates. the risk of adverse changes in the economic value of our non-trading positions arising from changes in interest rates is managed through our alm activities. we have elected to account for certain assets and liabilities under the fair value option.
our trading positions are reported at fair value with changes reflected in income. trading positions are subject to various changes in market-based risk factors. the majority of this risk is generated by our activities in the interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, equity and commodities markets. in addition, the values of assets and liabilities could change due to market liquidity, correlations across markets and expectations of market volatility. we seek to manage these risk exposures by using a variety of techniques that encompass a broad range of financial instruments. the key risk management techniques are discussed in more detail in the trading risk management section.
grm is responsible for providing senior management with a clear and comprehensive understanding of the trading risks to which we are exposed. these responsibilities include ownership of market risk policy, developing and maintaining quantitative risk models, calculating aggregated risk measures, establishing and monitoring position limits consistent with risk appetite, conducting daily reviews and analysis of trading inventory, approving material risk exposures and fulfilling regulatory requirements. market risks that impact businesses outside of global markets are monitored and governed by their respective governance functions.
model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports. given that models are used across the corporation, model risk impacts all risk types including credit, market and operational risks. the enterprise model risk policy defines model risk standards, consistent with our risk framework and risk appetite, prevailing regulatory guidance and industry best practice. all models, including risk management, valuation and regulatory capital models, must meet certain validation criteria, including effective challenge of the conceptual soundness of the model, independent model testing and ongoing monitoring through outcomes analysis and benchmarking. the enterprise model risk committee, a subcommittee of the mrc, oversees that model standards are consistent with model risk requirements and monitors the effective challenge in the model validation process across the corporation.
interest rate risk interest rate risk represents exposures to instruments whose values vary with the level or volatility of interest rates. these instruments include, but are not limited to, loans, debt securities, certain trading-related assets and liabilities, deposits, borrowings and derivatives. hedging instruments used to mitigate these risks include derivatives such as options, futures, forwards and swaps.
foreign exchange risk foreign exchange risk represents exposures to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. the types of instruments exposed to this risk include investments in non-u.s. subsidiaries, foreign currency-denominated loans and securities, future cash flows in foreign currencies arising from foreign exchange transactions, foreign currency-denominated debt and various foreign exchange derivatives whose values fluctuate with changes in the level or volatility of currency exchange rates or non-u.s. interest rates. hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include foreign exchange options, currency swaps, futures, forwards, and foreign currency-denominated debt and deposits.
mortgage risk mortgage risk represents exposures to changes in the values of mortgage-related instruments. the values of these instruments are sensitive to prepayment rates, mortgage rates, agency debt ratings, default, market liquidity, government participation and interest rate volatility. our exposure to these instruments takes several forms. for example, we trade and engage in market-making activities in a variety of mortgage securities including whole loans, pass-through certificates, commercial mortgages and collateralized mortgage obligations including collateralized debt obligations using mortgages as underlying collateral. in addition, we originate a variety of mbs, which involves the accumulation of mortgage-related loans in anticipation of eventual securitization, and we may hold positions in mortgage securities and residential mortgage loans as part of the alm portfolio. we also record msrs as part of our mortgage origination activities. hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include derivatives such as options, swaps, futures and forwards as well as securities including mbs and u.s. treasury securities. for more information, see mortgage banking risk management on page 80.
equity market risk equity market risk represents exposures to securities that represent an ownership interest in a corporation in the form of domestic and foreign common stock or other equity-linked instruments. instruments that would lead to this exposure include, but are not limited to, the following: common stock, exchange-traded funds, american depositary receipts, convertible bonds, listed equity options (puts and calls), otc equity options, equity total return swaps, equity index futures and other equity derivative products. hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options, futures, swaps, convertible bonds and cash positions.
commodity risk commodity risk represents exposures to instruments traded in the petroleum, natural gas, power and metals markets. these instruments consist primarily of futures, forwards, swaps and options. hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options, futures and swaps in the same or similar commodity product, as well as cash positions.
bank of america issuer credit risk issuer credit risk represents exposures to changes in the creditworthiness of individual issuers or groups of issuers. our portfolio is exposed to issuer credit risk where the value of an asset may be adversely impacted by changes in the levels of credit spreads, by credit migration or by defaults. hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include bonds, cds and other credit fixed-income instruments.
market liquidity risk market liquidity risk represents the risk that the level of expected market activity changes dramatically and, in certain cases, may even cease. this exposes us to the risk that we will not be able to transact business and execute trades in an orderly manner which may impact our results. this impact could be further exacerbated if expected hedging or pricing correlations are compromised by disproportionate demand or lack of demand for certain instruments. we utilize various risk mitigating techniques as discussed in more detail in trading risk management.
trading risk management to evaluate risks in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions. various techniques and procedures are utilized to enable the most complete understanding of these risks. quantitative measures of market risk are evaluated on a daily basis from a single position to the portfolio of the corporation. these measures include sensitivities of positions to various market risk factors, such as the potential impact on revenue from a one basis point change in interest rates, and statistical measures utilizing both actual and hypothetical market moves, such as var and stress testing. periods of extreme market stress influence the reliability of these techniques to varying degrees. qualitative evaluations of market risk utilize the suite of quantitative risk measures while understanding each of their respective limitations. additionally, risk managers independently evaluate the risk of the portfolios under the current market environment and potential future environments.
var is a common statistic used to measure market risk as it allows the aggregation of market risk factors, including the effects of portfolio diversification. a var model simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. var represents the loss a portfolio is not expected to exceed more than a certain number of times per period, based on a specified holding period, confidence level and window of historical data. we use one var model consistently across the trading portfolios and it uses a historical simulation approach based on a three-year window of historical data. our primary var statistic is equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level, which means that for a var with a one-day holding period, there should not be losses in excess of var, on average, 99 out of 100 trading days.
within any var model, there are significant and numerous assumptions that will differ from company to company. the accuracy of a var model depends on the availability and quality of historical data for each of the risk factors in the portfolio. a var model may require additional modeling assumptions for new products that do not have the necessary historical market data or for less liquid positions for which accurate daily prices are not consistently available. for positions with insufficient historical data for the var calculation, the process for establishing an appropriate proxy is based on fundamental and statistical analysis of the new product or less liquid position. this analysis identifies reasonable alternatives that replicate both the expected volatility and correlation to other market risk factors that the missing data would be expected to experience.
var may not be indicative of realized revenue volatility as changes in market conditions or in the composition of the portfolio can have a material impact on the results. in particular, the historical data used for the var calculation might indicate higher or lower levels of portfolio diversification than will be experienced. in order for the var model to reflect current market conditions, we update the historical data underlying our var model on a weekly basis, or more frequently during periods of market stress, and regularly review the assumptions underlying the model. a minor portion of risks related to our trading positions is not included in var. these risks are reviewed as part of our icaap. for more information regarding icaap, see capital management on page 49.
grm continually reviews, evaluates and enhances our var model so that it reflects the material risks in our trading portfolio. changes to the var model are reviewed and approved prior to implementation and any material changes are reported to management through the appropriate management committees.
trading limits on quantitative risk measures, including var, are independently set by global markets risk management and reviewed on a regular basis so that trading limits remain relevant and within our overall risk appetite for market risks. trading limits are reviewed in the context of market liquidity, volatility and strategic business priorities. trading limits are set at both a granular level to allow for extensive coverage of risks as well as at aggregated portfolios to account for correlations among risk factors. all trading limits are approved at least annually. approved trading limits are stored and tracked in a centralized limits management system. trading limit excesses are communicated to management for review. certain quantitative market risk measures and corresponding limits have been identified as critical in the corporation's risk appetite statement. these risk appetite limits are reported on a daily basis and are approved at least annually by the erc and the board.
in periods of market stress, global markets senior leadership communicates daily to discuss losses, key risk positions and any limit excesses. as a result of this process, the businesses may selectively reduce risk.
table 43 presents the total market-based portfolio var, which is the combination of the total covered positions (and less liquid trading positions) portfolio and the fair value option portfolio. covered positions are defined by regulatory standards as trading assets and liabilities, both on- and off-balance sheet, that meet a defined set of specifications. these specifications identify the most liquid trading positions which are intended to be held for a short-term horizon and where we are able to hedge the material risk elements in a two-way market. positions in less liquid markets, or where there are restrictions on the ability to trade the positions, typically do not qualify as covered positions. foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions, except for structural foreign currency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory approval.
in addition, table 43 presents our fair value option portfolio, which includes substantially all of the funded and unfunded exposures for which we elect the fair value option, and their corresponding hedges. additionally, market risk var for trading activities as presented in table 43 differs from var used for regulatory capital calculations due to the holding period being bank of america used. the holding period for var used for regulatory capital calculations is 10 days, while for the market risk var presented below, it is one day. both measures utilize the same process and methodology.
the total market-based portfolio var results in table 43 include market risk to which we are exposed from all business segments, excluding credit valuation adjustment (cva), dva and related hedges. the majority of this portfolio is within the global markets segment.
table 43 presents year-end, average, high and low daily trading var for 2022 and 2021 using a 99 percent confidence level. the amounts disclosed in table 43 and table 44 align to the view of covered positions used in the basel 3 capital calculations. foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions, regardless of trading or banking treatment for the trade, except for structural foreign currency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory approval.
the annual average of total covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio var increased for 2022 compared to 2021 driven by heightened market volatility and reduced diversification across asset classes.

(1)the high and low for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the high and low for the components. therefore the impact from less liquid exposures and the amount of portfolio diversification, which is the difference between the total portfolio and the sum of the individual components, is not relevant.
(2)impact is net of diversification effects between the covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolios.

additional var statistics produced within our single var model are provided in table 44 at the same level of detail as in table 43. evaluating var with additional statistics allows for an increased understanding of the risks in the portfolio, as the historical market data used in the var calculation does not necessarily follow a predefined statistical distribution. table 44 presents average trading var statistics at 99 percent and 95 percent confidence levels for 2022 and 2021.

backtesting the accuracy of the var methodology is evaluated by backtesting, which compares the daily var results, utilizing a one-day holding period, against a comparable subset of trading revenue. a backtesting excess occurs when a trading loss exceeds the var for the corresponding day. these excesses are evaluated to understand the positions and market moves that produced the trading loss with a goal to help confirm that the var methodology accurately represents those losses. we expect the frequency of trading losses in excess of var to be in line with the confidence level of the var statistic being tested. for example, with a 99 percent confidence level, we expect one trading loss in excess of var every 100 days or between two to three trading losses in excess of var over the course of a year. the number of backtesting excesses observed can differ from the statistically expected number of excesses if the current level of market volatility is materially different than the level of market volatility that existed during the three years of historical data used in the var calculation.
the trading revenue used for backtesting is defined by regulatory agencies in order to most closely align with the var component of the regulatory capital calculation. this revenue differs from total trading-related revenue in that it excludes revenue from trading activities that either do not generate market risk or the market risk cannot be included in var. some examples of the types of revenue excluded for backtesting are fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income and intra-day trading revenues.
we conduct daily backtesting on the var results used for regulatory capital calculations as well as the var results for key legal entities, regions and risk factors. these results are reported to senior market risk management. senior management regularly reviews and evaluates the results of these tests.
during 2022, there was one day where this subset of trading revenue had losses that exceeded our total covered portfolio var, utilizing a one-day holding period.
total trading-related revenue total trading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, and cva, dva and funding valuation adjustment gains (losses), represents the total amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. for more information on fair value, see note 20 - fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements.
trading-related revenue can be volatile and is largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. also, trading-related revenue is dependent on the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever-changing market environment. significant daily revenue by business is monitored and the primary drivers of these are reviewed.
the following histogram is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for 2022 and 2021. during 2022, positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 99 percent of the trading days, of which 90 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million, and the largest loss was $9 million. this compares to 2021 where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 97 percent of the trading days, of which 80 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million, and the largest loss was $45 million.
trading portfolio stress testing because the very nature of a var model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical window, we also stress test our portfolio using scenario analysis. this analysis estimates the change in the value of our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements.
a set of scenarios, categorized as either historical or hypothetical, are computed daily for the overall trading portfolio and individual businesses. these scenarios include shocks to underlying market risk factors that may be well beyond the shocks found in the historical data used to calculate var.

historical scenarios simulate the impact of the market moves that occurred during a period of extended historical market stress. generally, a multi-week period representing the most severe point during a crisis is selected for each historical scenario. hypothetical scenarios provide estimated portfolio impacts from potential future market stress events. scenarios are reviewed and updated in response to changing positions and new economic or political information. in addition, new or ad hoc scenarios are developed to address specific potential market events or particular vulnerabilities in the portfolio. the stress tests are reviewed on a regular basis and the results are presented to senior management.
stress testing for the trading portfolio is integrated with enterprise-wide stress testing and incorporated into the limits framework. the macroeconomic scenarios used for enterprise-wide stress testing purposes differ from the typical trading portfolio scenarios in that they have a longer time horizon and the results are forecasted over multiple periods for use in consolidated capital and liquidity planning. for more information, see managing risk on page 46.
interest rate risk management for the banking book the following discussion presents net interest income for banking book activities.
interest rate risk represents the most significant market risk exposure to our banking book balance sheet. interest rate risk is measured as the potential change in net interest income caused by movements in market interest rates. client-facing activities, primarily lending and deposit-taking, create interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet.
we prepare forward-looking forecasts of net interest income. the baseline forecast takes into consideration expected future business growth, alm positioning and the future direction of interest rate movements as implied by market-based forward curves.
we then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative interest rate scenarios have on the baseline forecast in order to assess interest rate sensitivity under varied conditions. the net interest income forecast is frequently updated for changing assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends, market conditions and business strategies. thus, we continually monitor our banking book balance sheet position in order to maintain an acceptable level of exposure to interest rate changes.
the interest rate scenarios that we analyze incorporate balance sheet assumptions such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, changes in funding mix, product repricing, maturity characteristics and investment securities premium amortization. our overall goal is to manage interest rate risk so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital.

table 46 shows the pretax impact to forecasted net interest income over the next 12 months from december 31, 2022 and 2021 resulting from instantaneous parallel and non-parallel shocks to the market-based forward curve. periodically, we evaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment. the interest rate scenarios also assume u.s. dollar interest rates are floored at zero. depending on the level of interest rates, down-rate scenarios may not receive the full impact of the rate shock, particularly in low rate environments.
the overall decrease in asset sensitivity, as shown in the following table, to up-rate scenarios was primarily due to an increase in long-end and short-end rates. we continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel upward move in interest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the short end of the yield curve. additionally, higher interest rates negatively impact the fair value of our debt securities classified as available for sale and adversely affect accumulated oci and thus capital levels under the basel 3 capital rules. under instantaneous upward parallel shifts, the near-term adverse impact to basel 3 capital would be reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income generated from the banking book activities. for more information on basel 3, see capital management - regulatory capital on page 50.

n/m = not meaningful bank of america the sensitivity analysis in table 46 assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates. as part of our alm activities, we use securities, certain residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity.
the behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income. the sensitivity analysis in table 46 assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments. in higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce our benefit in those scenarios.
interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts we use interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts in our alm activities to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks. specifically, we use those derivatives to manage both the variability in cash flows and changes in fair value of various assets and liabilities arising from those risks. our interest rate derivative contracts are generally non-leveraged swaps tied to various benchmark interest rates and foreign exchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards, and our foreign exchange contracts include cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign currency futures contracts, foreign currency forward contracts and options.
the derivatives used in our alm activities can be split into two broad categories: designated accounting hedges and other risk management derivatives. designated accounting hedges are primarily used to manage our exposure to interest rates as described in the interest rate risk management for the banking book section and are included in the sensitivities presented in table 46. the corporation also uses foreign currency derivatives in accounting hedges to manage substantially all of the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations. by hedging the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations, the corporation's market risk exposure in this area is not significant.
risk management derivatives are predominantly used to hedge foreign exchange risks related to various foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities and eliminate substantially all foreign currency exposures in the cash flows of the corporation's non-trading foreign currency-denominated financial instruments. these foreign exchange derivatives are sensitive to other market risk exposures such as cross-currency basis spreads and interest rate risk. however, as these features are not a significant component of these foreign exchange derivatives, the market risk related to this exposure is not significant. for more information on the accounting for derivatives, see note 3 - derivatives to the consolidated financial statements.
mortgage banking risk management we originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. we determine whether loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate.
interest rate risk and market risk can be substantial in the mortgage business. changes in interest rates and other market factors impact the volume of mortgage originations. changes in interest rates also impact the value of interest rate lock commitments (irlcs) and the related residential first mortgage lhfs between the date of the irlc and the date the loans are sold to the secondary market. an increase in mortgage interest rates typically leads to a decrease in the value of these instruments. conversely, when there is an increase in interest rates, the value of the msrs will increase driven by lower prepayment expectations. because the interest rate risks of these hedged items offset, we combine them into one overall hedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio consisting of derivative contracts and securities.
during 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded gains of $78 million, $39 million and $321 million. for more information on msrs, see note 20 - fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements.
compliance and operational risk management compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or damage to the reputation of the corporation arising from the failure of the corporation to comply with the requirements of applicable laws, rules, regulations and our internal policies and procedures (collectively, applicable laws, rules and regulations). we are subject to comprehensive regulation under federal and state laws, rules and regulations in the u.s. and the laws of the various jurisdictions in which we operate, including those related to financial crimes and anti-money laundering, market conduct, trading activities, fair lending, privacy, data protection and unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices.
operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems, people or external events, and includes legal risk. operational risk may occur anywhere in the corporation, including third-party business processes, and is not limited to operations functions. the corporation faces a number of key operational risks including third-party risk, model risk, conduct risk, technology risk, information security risk and data risk. operational risk can result in financial losses and reputational impacts and is a component in the calculation of total rwa used in the basel 3 capital calculation. for more information on basel 3 calculations, see capital management on page 49.
flus and control functions are first and foremost responsible for managing all aspects of their businesses, including their compliance and operational risk. flus and control functions are required to understand their business processes and related risks and controls, including third-party dependencies and the related regulatory requirements, and monitor and report on the effectiveness of the control environment. in order to actively monitor and assess the performance of their processes and controls, they must conduct comprehensive quality assurance activities and identify issues and risks to remediate control gaps and weaknesses. flus and control functions must also adhere to compliance and operational risk appetite limits to meet strategic, capital and financial planning objectives. finally, flus and control functions are responsible for the proactive identification, management and escalation of compliance and operational risks across the corporation. collectively, these efforts are important to strengthen their compliance and operational resiliency, which is the ability to deliver critical operations through disruption.
global compliance and operational risk teams independently assess compliance and operational risk, monitor business activities and processes and evaluate flus and control functions for adherence to applicable laws, rules and regulations, including identifying issues and risks, and reporting bank of america on the state of the control environment. corporate audit provides an independent assessment and validation through testing of key compliance and operational risk processes and controls across the corporation.
the corporation's global compliance - enterprise policy and operational risk management - enterprise policy set the requirements for reporting compliance and operational risk information to executive management as well as the board or appropriate board-level committees and reflect global compliance and operational risk's responsibilities for conducting independent oversight of the corporation's compliance and operational risk management activities. the board provides oversight of compliance risk through its audit committee and the erc, and operational risk through its erc.
a key operational risk facing the corporation is information security, which includes cybersecurity. cybersecurity risk includes exposure to failures or interruptions of service or security breaches resulting from malicious technological attacks that impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our or third parties' operations, systems or data. the corporation seeks to mitigate information security risk and associated reputational and compliance risk by employing a multi-layered and intelligence-led global information security program focused on preparing for, preventing, detecting, mitigating, responding to and recovering from cyber threats and incidents and effectively operating the corporation's processes. additionally, our business continuity policy, standards and procedures are designed to maintain the availability of business functions and enable impacted units within the corporation and third parties to achieve strategic objectives in the event of a cybersecurity incident.
the global information security program is supported by three lines of defense. the global information security team within the first line of defense is responsible for the day-to-day management of the global information security program, which includes defining policies and procedures to safeguard the corporation's information systems and data, conducting vulnerability and third-party information security assessments, information security event management (e.g., responding to ransomware and distributed denial of service attacks), evaluation of external cyber intelligence, supporting industry cybersecurity efforts and working with governmental agencies, and developing employee training to support adherence to the corporation's policies and procedures. as the second line of defense, global compliance and operational risk independently assesses, monitors and tests information security risk across the corporation, as well as the effectiveness of the global information security program. corporate audit serves as the third line of defense, conducting additional independent review and validation of the first-line processes and functions. as part of our global information security program, we leverage both internal and external assessments and partnerships with industry leaders to help approach information security holistically. additionally the corporation maintains a comprehensive enterprise-wide program that defines standards for the planning, sourcing, management, and oversight of third-party relationships and third-party access to its system, facilities, and/or confidential or proprietary data for a business purpose or supervisory function.
through established governance structures, we have processes to help facilitate appropriate and effective oversight of information security risk. these routines enable our three lines of defense and management to debate information security risks and monitor control performance to allow for further escalation to executive management, management and board-level committees or to the board, as appropriate. the board is actively engaged in the oversight of bank of america's global information security program and devotes significant time and attention to the oversight of cybersecurity and information security risk. the board regularly discusses cybersecurity and information security risks with the chief technology and information officer and the chief information security officer. additionally, the erc receives regular reporting, and reviews and approves the information security program and policy on an annual basis.
reputational risk management reputational risk is the risk that negative perception of the corporation may adversely impact profitability or operations. reputational risk may result from many of the corporation's activities, including those related to the management of our strategic, operational, compliance and credit risks.
the corporation manages reputational risk through established policies and controls embedded throughout its business and risk management processes. we proactively monitor and identify potential reputational risk events and have processes established to mitigate reputational risks in a timely manner. if reputational risk events occur, we focus on remediating the underlying issue and taking action to minimize damage to the corporation's reputation. the corporation has processes and procedures in place to respond to events that give rise to reputational risk, including educating individuals and organizations that influence public opinion, implementing external communication strategies to mitigate the risk, and informing key stakeholders of potential reputational risks. the corporation's organization and governance structure provides oversight of reputational risks. reputational risk reporting is provided regularly and directly to senior management and the erc, which provides primary oversight of reputational risk. in addition, each flu has a committee, which includes representatives from legal and risk, that is responsible for the oversight of reputational risk, including approval for business activities that present elevated levels of reputational risks.
climate risk management climate-related risks are divided into two major categories: (1) risks related to the physical impacts of climate change, driven by extreme weather events such as hurricanes and floods, as well as chronic longer-term shifts such as rising average global temperatures and sea levels, and (2) risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy, which may entail extensive policy, legal, technology and market changes. these changes and events may have broad impacts on operations, supply chains, distribution networks, customers and markets and are otherwise referred to, respectively, as physical risk and transition risk. these risks may impact both financial and nonfinancial risk types. physical risk may lead to increased credit risk by diminishing borrowers' repayment capacity or impacting the value of collateral. physical risk may also increase operational risk by impacting the corporation's facilities, employees, customers or vendors. transition risks may amplify credit risk through the financial impacts of changes in policy, technology or the market on the corporation or its counterparties. unanticipated market changes can lead to sudden price adjustments and give rise to heightened market risk. in addition, reputational risk may arise, including from our climate-related practices and disclosures and if we do not meet our climate-related commitments.
effective management of climate risk requires coordinated governance, clearly defined roles and responsibilities and well-
bank of america developed processes to identify, measure, monitor and control risks. as climate risk spans all key risk types, we have developed and continue to enhance processes to embed climate risk considerations into our risk framework and risk management programs established for strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. our environmental and social risk policy framework aligns with our risk framework and provides additional clarity and transparency regarding our approach to environmental and social risks, inclusive of climate risk.
our governance framework establishes oversight of climate risk practices and strategies by the board, supported by its erc, as well as the mrc and the responsible growth committee, both of which are management-level committees comprised of senior leaders across every major flu and control function. the responsible growth committee is supported by the esg disclosure sub-committee, which is responsible for reviewing and providing oversight of the corporation's climate and esg-related public disclosures.
our climate risk management efforts are overseen by an executive officer who reports to the cro. the climate risk council, which consists of leaders across risk, flu and control functions, meets routinely to discuss our approach to managing climate-related risks in line with our risk framework.
in 2021, we publicly announced our commitment to achieve net zero emissions in our financing activities, operations, and supply chain before 2050 (net zero goal) and set 2030 emissions targets for our operations and supply chain. in connection with our net zero goal, in 2022, we announced a target to reduce emissions by 2030 associated with our financing activities related to auto manufacturing, energy and power generation (2030 targets). in our september 2022 task force on climate-related financial disclosures report, we disclosed our 2019 and 2020 financed emissions and emissions intensity metrics for these sectors, with 2019 serving as the baseline for our 2030 targets.
we plan to disclose the financed emissions for additional portions of our business loan portfolio in 2023, and we plan to set financing activity emission reduction targets for other key sectors by april 2024.
achieving our climate--related goals and targets, including our net zero goal and 2030 targets, may require technological advances, clearly defined roadmaps for industry sectors, new standards and public policies, including those that improve the cost of capital for the transition to a low-carbon economy and better emissions data reporting, as well as ongoing, strong and active engagement with customers, suppliers, investors, government officials and other stakeholders.
given the extended period of these and other climate-related goals we have established, our initiatives have not resulted in a significant effect on our results of operations or financial position in the relevant periods presented herein.
for more information about climate-related matters, including how the corporation manages climate risk, and the corporation's climate-related goals and commitments, including our plans to achieve our net zero goal and 2030 targets and progress on our sustainable finance goals, see the corporation's website, including our 2022 task force on climate-related financial disclosures report and the 2022
annual report to shareholders available on the investor relations portion of our website in march 2023. the contents of the corporation's website and 2022 annual report to shareholders are not incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10-k. for more information on climate-related risks, see item 1a. risk factors on page 8.
the foregoing discussion and our discussion in the 2022 annual report to shareholders regarding our goals and commitments with respect to climate risk management, including environmental transition considerations, include "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. these statements are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve certain known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and are often beyond the corporation's control. actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any of these forward-looking statements.
complex accounting estimates our significant accounting principles, as described in note 1 - summary of significant accounting principles to the consolidated financial statements, are essential in understanding the md&a. many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. we have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments.
the more judgmental estimates are summarized in the following discussion. we have identified and described the development of the variables most important in the estimation processes that involve mathematical models to derive the estimates. in many cases, there are numerous alternative judgments that could be used in the process of determining the inputs to the models. where alternatives exist, we have used the factors that we believe represent the most reasonable value in developing the inputs. actual performance that differs from our estimates of the key variables could materially impact our results of operations. separate from the possible future impact to our results of operations from input and model variables, the value of our lending portfolio and market-sensitive assets and liabilities may change subsequent to the balance sheet date, often significantly, due to the nature and magnitude of future credit and market conditions. such credit and market conditions may change quickly and in unforeseen ways and the resulting volatility could have a significant, negative effect on future operating results. these fluctuations would not be indicative of deficiencies in our models or inputs.
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. our process for determining the allowance for credit losses is discussed in note 1 - summary of significant accounting principles and note 5 - outstanding loans and leases and allowance for credit losses to the consolidated financial statements.
the determination of the allowance for credit losses is based on numerous estimates and assumptions, which require bank of america a high degree of judgment and are often interrelated. a critical judgment in the process is the weighting of our forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios that are incorporated into our quantitative models. as any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain, the corporation uses multiple macroeconomic scenarios in its ecl calculation, which have included a baseline scenario derived from consensus estimates, an adverse scenario reflecting an extended moderate recession, a downside scenario reflecting persistent inflation and interest rates above the baseline scenario, a tail risk scenario similar to the severely adverse scenario used in stress testing and an upside scenario that considers the potential for improvement above the baseline scenario. the overall economic outlook is weighted 95 percent towards a recessionary environment in 2023, with continued inflationary pressures leading to lower gross domestic product (gdp) and higher unemployment rate expectations as compared to the prior year. generally, as the consensus estimates improve or deteriorate, the allowance for credit losses will change in a similar direction. there are multiple variables that drive the macroeconomic scenarios with the key variables including, but not limited to, u.s. gdp and unemployment rates. as of december 31, 2021, the weighted macroeconomic outlook for the u.s. average unemployment rate was forecasted at 5.2 percent, 4.7 percent and 4.3 percent in the fourth quarters of 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively, and the weighted macroeconomic outlook for u.s. gdp was forecasted to grow at 2.1 percent, 1.9 percent and 1.9 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarters of 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively. as of december 31, 2022, the latest consensus estimates for the u.s. average unemployment rate for the fourth quarter of 2022 was 3.7 percent and u.s. gdp was forecasted to grow 0.4 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting a tighter labor market and depressed growth expectations compared to our macroeconomic outlook as of december 31, 2021, and were factored into our allowance for credit losses estimate as of december 31, 2022. in addition, as of december 31, 2022, the weighted macroeconomic outlook for the u.s. average unemployment rate was forecasted at 5.6 percent and 5.0 percent in the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2024, and the weighted macroeconomic outlook for u.s. gdp was forecasted to contract 0.4 percent and grow 1.2 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2024.
in addition to the above judgments and estimates, the allowance for credit losses can also be impacted by unanticipated changes in asset quality of the portfolio, such as increases or decreases in credit and/or internal risk ratings in our commercial portfolio, improvement or deterioration in borrower delinquencies or credit scores in our credit card portfolio and increases or decreases in home prices, which is a primary driver of ltvs, in our consumer real estate portfolio, all of which have some degree of uncertainty. the allowance for credit losses increased to $14.2 billion from $13.8 billion at december 31, 2021, primarily due to loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic outlook in 2022.
to provide an illustration of the sensitivity of the macroeconomic scenarios and other assumptions on the estimate of our allowance for credit losses, the corporation compared the december 31, 2022 modeled ecl from the baseline scenario and our adverse scenario. relative to the baseline scenario, the adverse scenario assumed a peak u.s. unemployment rate of nearly three percentage points higher than the baseline scenario, a decline in u.s. gdp followed by a prolonged recovery and a lower home price outlook with a difference of approximately eight percent at the trough. this sensitivity analysis resulted in a hypothetical increase in the allowance for credit losses of approximately $4 billion.
while the sensitivity analysis may be useful to understand how changes in macroeconomic assumptions could impact our modeled ecls, it is not meant to forecast how our allowance for credit losses is expected to change in a different macroeconomic outlook. importantly, the analysis does not incorporate a variety of factors, including qualitative reserves and the weighting of alternate scenarios, which could have offsetting effects on the estimate. considering the variety of factors contemplated when developing and weighting macroeconomic outlooks such as recent economic events, leading economic indicators, views of internal and third-party economists and industry trends, in addition to other qualitative factors, the corporation believes the allowance for credit losses at december 31, 2022 is appropriate.
fair value of financial instruments under applicable accounting standards, we are required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value. we classify fair value measurements of financial instruments and msrs based on the three-level fair value hierarchy in the accounting standards.
the fair values of assets and liabilities may include adjustments, such as market liquidity and credit quality, where appropriate. valuations of products using models or other techniques are sensitive to assumptions used for the significant inputs. where market data is available, the inputs used for valuation reflect that information as of our valuation date. inputs to valuation models are considered unobservable if they are supported by little or no market activity. in periods of extreme volatility, lessened liquidity or in illiquid markets, there may be more variability in market pricing or a lack of market data to use in the valuation process. in keeping with the prudent application of estimates and management judgment in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities, we have in place various processes and controls that include: a model validation policy that requires review and approval of quantitative models used for deal pricing, financial statement fair value determination and risk quantification; a trading product valuation policy that requires verification of all traded product valuations; and a periodic review and substantiation of daily profit and loss reporting for all traded products. primarily through validation controls, we utilize both broker and pricing service inputs which can and do include both market-observable and internally-modeled values and/or valuation inputs. our reliance on this information is affected by our understanding of how the broker and/or pricing service develops its data with a higher degree of reliance applied to those that are more directly observable and lesser reliance applied to those developed through their own internal modeling. for example, broker quotes in less active markets may only be indicative and therefore less reliable. these processes and controls are performed independently of the business. for more information, see note 20 - fair value measurements and note 21 - fair value option to the consolidated financial statements.
level 3 assets and liabilities financial assets and liabilities, and msrs, where values are based on valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and are significant to the overall fair value measurement are classified as level 3 under the fair value hierarchy established in applicable accounting standards. the fair value of these level 3 financial assets and liabilities and bank of america msrs is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.
level 3 financial instruments may be hedged with derivatives classified as level 1 or 2; therefore, gains or losses associated with level 3 financial instruments may be offset by gains or losses associated with financial instruments classified in other levels of the fair value hierarchy. the level 3 gains and losses recorded in earnings did not have a significant impact on our liquidity or capital. we conduct a review of our fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. transfers into or out of level 3 are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities became unobservable or observable, respectively, in the current marketplace. for more information on transfers into and out of level 3 during 2022, 2021 and 2020, see note 20 - fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements.
accrued income taxes and deferred tax assets accrued income taxes, reported as a component of either other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet, represent the net amount of current income taxes we expect to pay to or receive from various taxing jurisdictions attributable to our operations to date. we currently file income tax returns in more than 100 jurisdictions and consider many factors, including statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance, in estimating the appropriate accrued income taxes for each jurisdiction.
net deferred tax assets, reported as a component of other assets on the consolidated balance sheet, represent the net decrease in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of net operating loss (nol) and tax credit carryforwards and because of future reversals of temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and their bases as reported in the financial statements. nol and tax credit carryforwards result in reductions to future tax liabilities, and many of these attributes can expire if not utilized within certain periods. we consider the need for valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amounts that we estimate are more likely than not to be realized.
consistent with the applicable accounting guidance, we monitor relevant tax authorities and change our estimates of accrued income taxes and/or net deferred tax assets due to changes in income tax laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities. these revisions of our estimates, which also may result from our income tax planning and from the resolution of income tax audit matters, may be material to our operating results for any given period.
see note 19 - income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for a table of significant tax attributes and additional information. for more information, see page 17 under item 1a. risk factors - regulatory, compliance and legal.
goodwill and intangible assets the nature of and accounting for goodwill and intangible assets are discussed in note 1 - summary of significant accounting principles, and note 7 - goodwill and intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements.
we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of june 30, 2022. based on our assessment, we have concluded that goodwill was not impaired.

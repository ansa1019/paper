item 1a - risk factors we describe below certain risks that could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, business reputation, or business prospects. these risk factors may change from time to time and may be amended, supplemented, or superseded by updates to the risk factors contained in our future periodic reports on form 10-k, form 10-q, and reports on other forms we file with the sec. all forward-looking statements about our future results of operations or other matters made by us in this annual report, in our annual report to lowe's shareholders, and in our subsequently filed reports to the sec, as well as in our press releases and other public communications, are qualified by the risks described below.
you should read these risk factors in conjunction with "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8. there also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this annual report generally because we do not currently perceive them to be material. those factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations. in connection with any investment decision with respect to our securities, you should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information contained in this report and our other filings with the sec.
strategic, competitive, operational, and reputational risks we may be unable to adapt our business concept in a rapidly evolving retail environment to address the changing shopping habits, demands, and demographics of our customers.
the home improvement retail environment, like the retail environment generally, is rapidly evolving, and adapting our business concept to respond to our customers' changing shopping habits and demands and their changing demographics is critical to our future success. our success is dependent on our ability to identify and respond to the economic, social, style, and other trends that affect demographic and consumer preferences in a variety of our merchandise categories and service offerings, as well as consumer spending. customers' expectations about how they wish to research, purchase, and receive products and services have also evolved. it is difficult to predict the mix of products and services that our customers will demand. as our customers expect a more personalized experience, our ability to offer more localized assortments of our merchandise to appeal to local tastes within each customer group is important to our ability to effectively meet customer expectations. customers also have evolving preferences and expectations related to the sustainability of our products and operations. if we do not successfully differentiate the shopping experience to meet the individual needs and expectations of or within a customer group, we may lose market share with respect to those customers.
failure to identify such trends, adapt our business concept, implement an increasingly localized merchandising assortment, and implement related strategic initiatives successfully could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for the home improvement products and services we sell, the rate of growth of our business, our market share, and results of operations.
we may not be able to realize the intended benefits of our strategic initiatives focused on providing an omnichannel shopping experience to our customers if we fail to deliver the capabilities required to execute on them.
our interactions with customers have evolved into an omnichannel experience as they use computers, tablets, mobile phones, and other electronic devices to shop in our stores and online and provide feedback and public commentary about all aspects of our business. omnichannel and digital retail is quickly evolving, and we must anticipate and meet our customers' expectations and counteract new developments and technology investments by our competitors. our customer-facing technology systems must appeal to our customers, function as designed, and provide a consistent customer experience. we also need to collect, use, and share relevant customer data to effectively meet customer expectations of a more personalized experience. our ability to collect, use, and share such data is subject to a number of external factors, including the impact of legislation or regulations governing data privacy and security, as well as the change of third-party policies restricting data collection, use, and sharing.
the success of our strategic initiatives to adapt our business concept to our customers' changing shopping habits and demands and changing demographics have required us to, and will continue to require us to, deliver large, complex programs requiring integrated planning, initiative prioritization, and program sequencing. these initiatives have required, and will continue to require, new competencies in many positions, and our management, associates, and contractors have had to and will need to continue to adapt and learn new skills and capabilities. to the extent they are unable or unwilling to make these changes, we may be unable to realize the full benefits of our strategic initiatives and expand our relevant market access. failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies, products, or services could result in the value of those investments being table of contents written down or written off. in addition, to support our strategic initiatives and the related technology investments needed to implement our strategic investments, we must attract and retain a large number of skilled professionals, including technology professionals. the market for these professionals is increasingly competitive. our results of operations, financial condition, or business prospects could also be adversely affected if we fail to provide a consistent experience for our customers, regardless of sales channel, if our technology systems do not meet our customers' expectations, if we are unable to counteract new developments and innovations implemented by our competitors, or if we are unable to attract, retain, and manage the talent succession of additional personnel at various levels of the company who have the skills and capabilities we need to implement our strategic initiatives and drive the changes that are essential to successfully adapting our business concept in the rapidly changing retail environment.
we have many competitors who could take sales and market share from us if we fail to execute our strategic initiatives effectively, or if they develop a substantially more effective or lower cost means of meeting customer needs, resulting in a negative impact on our business and results of operations.
we operate in a highly competitive market for home improvement products and services and have numerous large and small, direct and indirect competitors. the principal competitive factors in our industry include location of stores, product assortment, product pricing, in-stock levels, customer service, and the evolution of technology and customer expectations. we face growing competition from online and omnichannel retailers who have a similar product or service offering. customers are increasingly able to quickly comparison shop and determine real-time product availability and price using digital tools. we will be at a competitive disadvantage if, over time, our competitors are more effective than us in their utilization and integration of rapidly evolving technologies, including artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies. further, online and omnichannel retailers continue to focus on delivery services, as customers are increasingly seeking faster, guaranteed delivery times, including same-day and next-day fulfillment, low-price or free shipping, and convenient pick-up options, and we must make investments to keep up with our customers' evolving shopping preferences. our ability to be competitive on delivery times, delivery costs, and delivery options depends on many factors, including successful implementation and the continued maintenance of our initiatives related to supply chain transformation, including our market-based delivery model, and our relationships with third parties providing delivery services. our failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the markets for home improvement products and services could affect our financial performance. moreover, changes in the promotional pricing and other practices of our competitors, including the effects of competitor liquidation activities, may impact our results.
if we fail to hire, train, manage, and retain qualified associates or corporate support staff with the capabilities of delivering on strategic objectives, our labor costs and results of operations could be negatively impacted.
our customers expect our associates to be well trained and knowledgeable about the products we sell and the home improvement services we provide. we compete with other retailers for many of our associates, and we are experiencing a competitive labor market with low unemployment. increasingly, our sales associates must have expanded skill sets. it is important that we attract and retain a diverse workforce that can deliver relevant, culturally competent, and differentiated experiences for a wide variety of culturally diverse customers. additionally, in order to deliver on the omnichannel expectations of our customers and related strategic objectives, we rely on the specialized training and capabilities of corporate support staff, which are broadly sought after by our competitors. further, our ability to successfully execute organizational changes, including management transitions within the company's senior leadership, are critical to our business success. the loss of key executive or senior officers or our failure to adequately plan for succession of senior management personnel could impact our ability to achieve our strategic objectives. if we are unable to hire, train, manage, and retain qualified associates, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our results of operations could be negatively affected.
our ability to meet our labor needs, particularly in a competitive labor market, while controlling our costs is subject to a variety of external factors, including wage rates, the availability of and competition for talent, health care and other benefit costs, our brand image and reputation, changing demographics and the adoption of new or revised legislation or regulations governing immigration, employment, labor relations, minimum wage, health care benefits and family and medical leave. wages are increasing across the united states, and due to competition among potential employers, we are subject to upward pressure on associate wages and employer-provided benefits, which in turn increases labor costs. additionally, many associates are in entry-level or part-time roles with historically higher turnover rates, which leads to increased training and retention costs. further, there is increased labor organizing activity in the united states. we are subject to labor organizing efforts from time to time, and if we become subject to collective bargaining agreements in the future, it could affect how we operate our business. our response to any organizing efforts could be perceived negatively and harm our business and reputation. in addition to our united states operations, we have support offices in india and china, and any extended disruption of our operations in our different locations, whether due to labor difficulties or otherwise, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
table of contents positively and effectively managing our public image and reputation is critical to our business success, and, if our public image and reputation are damaged, it could negatively impact our relationships with our customers, vendors, associates, and shareholders, and consequently, our business and results of operations.
our public image and reputation are critical to ensuring that our customers shop at lowe's, our vendors want to do business with lowe's, and our associates want to work for lowe's. we must continue to manage, preserve, and grow lowe's public image and reputation. lowe's actual or perceived position or lack of position on social, environmental, political, public policy, or other sensitive issues, and any perceived lack of transparency about those matters, could harm our reputation. in addition, failure to meet our stated environmental and social goals, and consumer and shareholder concerns about our environmental and social practices are potential sources of reputational risk. vendors and others with whom we do business may affect our reputation. any negative incident can erode trust and confidence quickly, and adverse publicity about us could damage our reputation and brand image, undermine our customers' confidence, reduce demand for our products and services, affect our relationships with current and future vendors, impact our results of operations, affect our ability to recruit, retain, and engage our associates, and attract regulatory scrutiny. the significant expansion in the use of social media over recent years has compounded the potential scope of the negative publicity that could be generated by such negative incidents.
additionally, our proprietary rights in our trademarks, trade names, service marks, domain names, copyrights, patents, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights are valuable assets of our business. we may not be able to prevent or even discover every instance of unauthorized third-party uses of our intellectual property or dilution of our brand names, such as when a third party uses trademarks that are identical or similar to our own. if we are unable to successfully protect our intellectual property rights, our business could be adversely affected.
failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality could damage our image with customers, expose us to litigation and negatively impact our sales, profitability, cash flows, and financial condition.
product and service quality issues could result in a negative impact on customer confidence in lowe's and our brand image. if our product and service offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers' expectations regarding safety or quality, we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal, financial and reputational risks. as a result, lowe's reputation as a retailer of high-quality products and services, including both national and lowe's private brands, could suffer and impact customer loyalty. additionally, we and our customers have expectations on responsible sourcing and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. under our vendor code of conduct, our vendors are required to meet our expectations across multiple areas of compliance, including health and safety, environmental standards, compensation, hours of work, and prohibitions on child and forced labor. where appropriate, we request that our vendors provide additional documentation proving their compliance in these areas. if we need to seek alternative sources of supply from vendors with whom we have less familiarity, the risk of our standards not being met may increase. actual, potential, or perceived product safety concerns or vendor non-compliance exposes us to litigation, as well as government enforcement action, and could, and in certain instances in the past has, resulted in costly product recalls, the inability to sell certain products due to customs actions, including regulatory enforcement inquiries, holds, detentions, and exclusions, and other liabilities.
our sales and profitability depend on our ability to maintain our store base and maintain appropriate levels of inventory and failure to do so may affect our business, financial condition and result of operations.
we have a store base that requires maintenance, investment, and space reallocation initiatives to deliver the shopping experience that our customers desire. our capital investments in our stores may not deliver the convenience or relevant shopping experience our customers expect. it is important that we maintain appropriate levels of inventory in our stores and supply chain facilities and respond to changing customer demands. we must also maintain a safe store environment for our customers and associates, as well as to protect against loss or theft of our inventory (known as "shrink"). higher rates of shrink, which we have experienced from time to time, including as a result of organized retail crime, can require operational changes that may increase costs and adversely impact customer and associate experience.
supply chain and third-party risks disruptions in our supply chain and our fulfillment network for our products due to various factors including, but not limited to, global health crises, geopolitical conflicts, trade policy changes, and additional tariffs, have affected and may continue to affect our business and results of operations.
we source, stock, and sell products from domestic and international vendors, and their ability to reliably and efficiently fulfill our orders is critical to our business success. catastrophic events, extreme weather conditions, public health crises, and global economic and political conditions may adversely affect our global supply chain. for example, impacts related to the covid-19 pandemic placed strains on the domestic and international supply chain, which negatively affected the flow and availability of our products in the past due to difficulties in timely obtaining products from the manufacturers and suppliers of our products.
table of contents we source a large number of our products from foreign manufacturers, with china being the dominant import source. tax and trade policies, tariffs, and other regulations affecting trade between the united states and other countries, especially china, increase the cost of our merchandise sourced from outside of the united states, which represents a large percentage of our private branded and national brand merchandise. it remains unclear how tax or trade policies, tariffs, customs actions, or trade relations may evolve in the future, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, effective income tax rate, liquidity, and net income. in addition, other countries may change their business and trade policies in anticipation of or in response to increased import tariffs and other changes in u.s. trade policy and regulations already enacted or that may be enacted in the future. the degree of our exposure is dependent on, among other things, the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of tariffs. the impact to our business, including net sales and gross margin, will be influenced in part by merchandising and pricing strategies in response to potential cost increases by us and our competitors. while these potential impacts are uncertain, they could have an adverse impact on our financial results.
financial instability among key vendors, political instability, geopolitical or armed conflicts, and labor unrest in source countries or elsewhere in our supply chain, changes in the total costs in our supply chain (including fuel), labor costs or labor shortages among our vendors, port labor disputes and security, the outbreak of pandemics, weather-related events, natural disasters, work stoppages, shipping capacity restraints, shipping delays and disruptions, changes in trade policy, retaliatory trade restrictions imposed by either the united states or a major source country, tariffs or duties, customs actions, including regulatory enforcement inquiries, holds, detentions, and exclusions, fluctuations in transport availability, capacity, and costs are beyond our control and could negatively impact our business if they seriously disrupted the movement of products through our supply chain or increased their costs. in recent years, u.s. ports have been impacted by capacity constraints, port congestion and delays, periodic labor disputes, security issues, weather-related events, and natural disasters, which were further exacerbated by the covid-19 pandemic.
additionally, as we add fulfillment capabilities or pursue strategies with different fulfillment requirements, our fulfillment network becomes increasingly complex and operating it becomes more challenging. if our fulfillment network does not operate properly or if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments, we experience delays in inventory, increased delivery costs or merchandise out-of-stocks that could lead to lost sales and decreased customer confidence, and adversely affect our results of operations.
the execution of initiatives to transform our supply chain network could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these investments might not provide the anticipated benefits.
we continue to transform and expand our supply chain network and existing omnichannel capabilities to meet changing customer needs. these investments are designed to promote greater network capacity and better flow management and optimization while leveraging a market delivery model. failure to choose the right investments and implement them in the right manner and at the right pace could disrupt our operations. if we are unable to effectively manage the volume, timing, nature, location, and cost of these investments, projects, and changes, our business operations and financial results could be materially and adversely affected. the cost and potential problems, defects of design, and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with implementing new technologies, restructuring support systems and processes, securing appropriate facility locations, addressing impacts on inventory levels, and managing third-party service providers, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations and impact our profitability. our investments to enhance and expand our supply chain might not provide the anticipated benefits, or might take longer than expected to complete or realize anticipated benefits, or might fail altogether, each of which could adversely impact our competitive position and our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
our inability to effectively and efficiently manage and maintain our relationships with selected suppliers of both national brand and private branded products could negatively impact our business operations and financial results.
we form strategic relationships, some of which are exclusive, with selected suppliers to market and develop products under a variety of recognized and respected national brand names. we also have relationships with certain suppliers to enable us to sell private branded products which differentiate us from other retailers. the inability to effectively and efficiently manage and maintain our relationships with these suppliers could negatively impact our business operations and financial results.
failure of a key vendor or service provider that we cannot quickly replace could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
we rely upon a number of vendors as the sole or primary source of some of the products we sell. we also rely upon many independent service providers for technology solutions and other services that are important to many aspects of our business. many of these vendors and service providers have certain products or specialized skills needed to support our business concept and our strategies. if these vendors or service providers discontinue operations or are unable to perform as expected, or if we table of contents fail to manage them properly or we are unable to replace them quickly, our business could be adversely affected, at least temporarily, until we are able to replace them.
failures relating to our third-party installer program or by our third-party installers have resulted in and could result in increased operational and legal risks and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we contract with third-party installers to provide installation services to our customers, and, as the general contractor, we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors, including certain licensing and permitting requirements, and those relating to the quality and performance of our third-party installers. we have faced investigations by one or more government agencies relating to our compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including an investigation with respect to whether we are in compliance with applicable recordkeeping requirements and lead-safe practices. any adverse result following such investigations could negatively affect our operations. in addition, failures by us or our third-party installers to effectively manage such requirements and internal processes regarding installation services have, from time to time, resulted in, and in the future could result in lost sales, fines, and lawsuits, as well as damage to our reputation, and may result in the loss of our general contractor licenses, which could negatively affect our business.
technology and cybersecurity risks our financial performance could be adversely affected if our information systems or the information systems of third-party vendors are seriously disrupted or we fail to properly maintain, improve, upgrade, and expand those systems.
our efforts to provide an omnichannel experience for our customers include investing in, maintaining, and making ongoing improvements of our existing information systems that support operations, such as sales, inventory replenishment, merchandise ordering, project design and execution, transportation, receipt processing and fulfillment. we also engage third-party vendors for a variety of reasons, including for digital storage technology and content delivery. such vendors may have access to information about our customers, associates, or vendors. our systems and the systems of third-party vendors are subject to damage or interruption as a result of catastrophic events, power outages, viruses, malicious attacks, and telecommunications failures, or other vulnerabilities and irregularities, and as a result we may incur significant expense, data loss, as well as an erosion of customer confidence.
additionally, we continually make investments in our systems which may introduce disruption. in particular, the company is undergoing a multi-year technology transformation which includes updating and modernizing our merchandise selling system, as well as certain accounting and finance systems. we may not be able to achieve the anticipated benefits of these investments and may experience operational challenges such as delays or errors in implementation, security failures such as loss or corruption of data, reputational harm, increased costs and other significant disruptions. our financial performance could be adversely affected if our information systems are seriously disrupted or we fail to properly maintain, improve, upgrade, and expand those systems.
the failure of customer-facing technology systems to perform effectively and reliably could keep us from delivering positive customer experiences.
access to the internet from computers, tablets, smartphones and other mobile communication devices has empowered our customers and changed the way they shop and how we interact with them. our websites, primarily lowes.com, are a sales channel for our products, and are also a method of making product, project, and other relevant information available to our customers that impacts our in-store sales. additionally, we have other affiliated websites and mobile apps through which we seek to inspire, inform, cross-sell, establish online communities among, and otherwise interact with our customers, including through online visualization and configuration tools. performance issues with these customer-facing technology systems, including temporary outages caused by distributed denial of service, ransomware, or other cyber-attacks, or a complete failure of one or more of them without a disaster recovery plan that can be quickly implemented, could quickly destroy the positive benefits they provide to our home improvement business and negatively affect our customers' perceptions of lowe's as a reliable online vendor and source of information about home improvement products and services.
our business, reputation, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected by cybersecurity incidents and the failure to protect customer, associate, vendor, or company information or to comply with evolving regulations relating to our obligation to protect our systems, assets, and such information.
cyber-attacks and tactics designed to gain access to and exploit sensitive information by breaching mission critical systems of large organizations are constantly evolving, and high profile security breaches leading to unauthorized release of sensitive customer information have occurred in recent years with increasing frequency at a number of major u.s. companies, including several large retailers, despite widespread recognition of the cyber-attack threat and improved data protection methods.
table of contents as with many other retailers, we collect, process, transmit, store, and delete certain personal information about our customers, associates, and vendors, as well as confidential, sensitive, proprietary and business, personal and payment card information. additionally, we use third-party service providers for certain services, such as authentication, content delivery, back-office support, fraud prevention, order and service fulfillment, supply chain management, customer service, workforce management, and other functions, and we provide such third-party service providers with personal and other confidential information necessary for the services concerned.
in the normal course of business, we and our third-party service providers have in the past and will likely continue to experience cybersecurity threats and incidents, and certain of our third-party service providers have been subject to disruption due to ransomware and other cyber-attacks. although, we do not believe such cybersecurity threats or incidents have had a material impact on us to date, there is no guarantee that a future cybersecurity threat or incident will be detected and remediated to not have a material adverse impact on our business strategy, reputation, results of operations, or financial condition. it can be difficult to preempt or detect ever-evolving forms of cyber-attacks, and we and our third-party service providers may not be able to adequately anticipate or prevent a future breach in our or their systems that results in the unauthorized access to, destruction, misuse, or release of personal information or other sensitive data. the increased levels of remote access to our information systems and the continued use of remote work infrastructure has further increased the possible attack surfaces, and we are exposed to increased risk to the security of our information systems or the information systems of third-party vendors and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data.
a ransomware attack could prevent us or our third-party service providers from accessing data or systems that support lowe's operations. our information security or our service providers' information security may also be compromised because of human errors or acts, including by associates, or system errors. our systems and our service providers' systems are additionally vulnerable to a number of other causes, such as critical infrastructure outages, computer viruses, technology system failures, catastrophic events or cyber-attacks, including the use of malicious codes, worms, phishing, and ransomware. in the event that our systems are breached or damaged for any reason, we may also suffer loss or unavailability of data and interruptions to our business operations while such breach or damage is being remedied. should these events occur, the unauthorized disclosure, loss, or unavailability of data and disruption to our business may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, drive existing and potential customers away and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, or potential liability, including possible litigation and punitive damages. a security breach resulting in the unauthorized release of data from our information systems or our third-party service providers' information systems would also materially increase the costs we already incur to protect against such risks and require dedication of substantial resources to manage the aftermath of such a breach. we maintain cybersecurity insurance coverage although such insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur or may not cover certain cyber incidents. additionally, the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies and the implementation of pilot programs integrating generative artificial intelligence into our internal and customer-facing systems may intensify our cybersecurity risks and create new risks to our business, operations, and financial condition.
data privacy and cybersecurity laws are constantly changing, and the implementation of these laws has become more complex. in order to maintain our compliance with such laws as they come to fruition, we may sustain increased costs and change our business policies and processes in order to adapt to new requirements that are or become applicable to us. as the regulatory environment relating to retailers' and other companies' obligation to protect personal information becomes stricter, a material failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could subject us to fines, other regulatory sanctions, or government investigation, and potentially to lawsuits brought by private individuals, regulators or states' attorney general. such violation or perceived violation of privacy, including improper collection, use of sharing of personal information, or failure to sufficiently disclose privacy practice, can adversely affect the trust that customers, associates, and business partners have in us related to their personal information.
see item 1c of this form 10-k, "cybersecurity," for more information on our cybersecurity risk management and governance.
we are subject to payments-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud, subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business.
we accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit cards, debit cards, credit accounts, our private label and co-branded credit cards, trade credit, mobile and electronic payments, gift cards, cash, consumer invoicing and physical bank checks, and we may offer different payment options over time. these payment options subject us to many compliance requirements, including, but not limited to, compliance with payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements, rules governing electronic funds transfers and payment card industry data security standards. they also subject us to potential fraud by criminal elements seeking to discover and take advantage of security vulnerabilities that may exist in some of these payment systems. if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, or if our data security systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card issuing banks' costs, subject to fines and higher transaction table of contents fees, and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. for certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs. additionally, we rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, gift cards, promotional financing, and other forms of electronic payment, and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. national outages with our third-party credit and debit processor have resulted in lost sales and declined transactions after purchases. future occurrences of such failures in third party systems are difficult to predict and may adversely affect our operations in unexpected ways.
investment-related risks our strategic transactions involve risks, and we may not realize the expected benefits because of numerous uncertainties and risks.
we regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, investments and other growth, market and geographic expansion strategies, with the expectation that these transactions will result in increases in sales, cost savings, synergies, and other various benefits. our ability to deliver the expected benefits from any strategic transaction is subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, including our ability to integrate personnel, labor models, financial, it and other systems successfully; disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management; hiring additional management and other critical personnel; and increasing the scope, geographic diversity, and complexity of our operations. effective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable and accurate financial reports, and the integration of businesses may create complexity in our financial systems and internal controls and make them more difficult to manage. integration of businesses into our internal control system could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. additionally, we have recognized material impairments in the past and may do so in the future, including in connection with assets we have acquired or divested in a strategic transaction or charges to earnings associated with any strategic transaction, which have and may in the future materially reduce our earnings. for example, in fiscal 2022, the company recorded pre-tax impairment, loss on sale, and other closing costs of $2.5 billion related to the sale of its canadian retail business, which reduced earnings for fiscal 2022. our shareholders may react unfavorably to our strategic transactions and strategic transactions may also be subject to regulatory uncertainty due to the changing enforcement landscape. we may not realize the anticipated benefits from such transactions, we may be exposed to additional liabilities of any acquired business or joint venture, and we may be exposed to litigation in connection with the strategic transaction. further, we may finance these strategic transactions by incurring additional debt, which could increase leverage or impact our ability to access capital in the future.
legal, regulatory and other external risks our sales are dependent upon the health and stability of the general economy. adverse changes in macroeconomic factors specific to the home improvement industry may negatively impact the rate of growth of our total sales and comparable sales.
many macroeconomic factors may adversely affect our financial performance. these include, but are not limited to, periods of slow economic growth or recession, home price appreciation or decreasing housing turnover, age of housing stock, volatility and/or lack of liquidity from time to time in u.s. and world financial markets and the consequent reduced availability and/or higher cost of borrowing to lowe's and its customers, slower rates of growth in real disposable personal income that could affect the rate of growth in consumer spending, inflation and its impacts on discretionary spending and on our costs, shortages, and other disruptions in the labor supply, the impact of rising interest rates, consumer debt levels, changes in tax rates and policy, outbreak of pandemics, fluctuations in fuel and energy costs, inflation or deflation of commodity prices, natural disasters, geopolitical or armed conflicts, and acts of both domestic and international terrorism. additionally, in fiscal 2023, we continued to operate in an environment with inflationary pressures and higher interest rates. in particular, if cost inflation of merchandise increases beyond our ability to control or respond effectively, we may not be able to adjust prices to sufficiently offset the effect of the various cost increases without negatively impacting consumer demand. sales of many of our product categories and services are driven by the activity level of home improvement projects. adverse development in these factors could result in a decrease in home improvement activity which could reduce demand for our products and services.
our business could be affected by uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions, including natural disasters and changes in climate, as well as other catastrophic events, which could impact our operations.
natural disasters, such as hurricanes and tropical storms, fires, floods, tornadoes, and earthquakes; unseasonable, or unexpected or extreme weather conditions, such as major or extended winter storms or droughts, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise; severe changes in climate; pandemics and public health concerns; acts of terrorism or violence, including active shooter situations; civil unrest; or similar disruptions and catastrophic events can affect consumer spending and confidence and table of contents consumers' disposable income, particularly with respect to home improvement or construction projects, and could have an adverse effect on our financial performance. natural disasters or catastrophic climate events may increase demand for certain of our products, and if we are unable to meet such customer demands, our reputation, business, and financial operations could be harmed, particularly if our responses to such events are less adequate than those of our competitors. these types of events can also adversely affect our workforce and prevent associates and customers from reaching our stores and other facilities. they can also disrupt or disable operations of stores, support centers, and portions of our supply chain and distribution network, including causing reductions in the availability of inventory and disruption of utility services. in addition, these events may affect our information systems, resulting in disruption to various aspects of our operations, including our ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders and to communicate with our stores. unseasonable, unexpected or extreme weather conditions such as excessive precipitation, warm temperatures during the winter season, or prolonged or extreme periods of warm or cold temperatures, could render a portion of our inventory damaged or unsellable. as a consequence of these or other catastrophic or uncharacteristic events, we may experience interruption to our operations, increased costs, or losses of property, equipment or inventory, which would adversely affect our revenue and profitability.
our business and operations are subject to risks related to the long-term effects of global climate change.
our business and operations are subject to climate-related risks. these include both physical risks (such as extreme weather conditions or rising sea levels) and transition risks (such as regulatory or technology changes), which are expected to be widespread and unpredictable. climate change, extreme weather conditions, wildfires, droughts, and rising sea levels may impact the areas in which the company's operations and facilities are located, and they could also affect our ability to procure commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience. such events could result in an increase in our costs and expenses and harm our future revenue, cash flows, and financial performance. government regulations limiting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may increase compliance and merchandise costs, and other regulations affecting energy inputs could materially affect our profitability. in addition, we use natural gas, diesel fuel, gasoline and electricity in our operations, all of which could face increased regulation as a result of climate change or other environmental concerns.
our costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations.
our business is subject to a wide array of federal, state, and local laws and regulations. in recent years, a number of new laws and regulations have been adopted, and there has been expanded enforcement of certain existing laws and regulations by federal, state, and local agencies. these laws and regulations, and related interpretations and enforcement activity, may change as a result of a variety of factors, including political, economic, or social events. changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage requirements, collective bargaining, the classification of exempt and non-exempt employees, the distinction between employees and contractors, other wage, labor or workplace regulations, health care, data privacy and cybersecurity, the sale and pricing of some of our products, transportation, logistics, international trade, responsible sourcing, supply chain transparency, taxes, unclaimed property, sustainability, the environment and climate change, including energy costs and consumption, could increase our costs of doing business or impact our operations. in addition, if we fail to comply with other applicable laws and regulations, including the foreign corrupt practices act and local anti-bribery laws, we could be subject to reputational and legal risks, including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
future litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences, including judgments or settlements, negatively affecting our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
we are, and in the future will become, involved in lawsuits, including consumer, commercial, employment, tort and other litigation, regulatory inquiries, and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business. some of these proceedings raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties and complexities. the timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits, regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings is typically uncertain. additionally, the possible outcomes of, or resolutions to, these proceedings could include adverse judgments or settlements, either of which could require substantial payments. furthermore, defending against these proceedings may require a diversion of management's attention and resources. none of the legal proceedings in which we are currently involved, individually or collectively, are considered material.
the inflation or deflation of commodity and other prices could affect our prices, demand for our products, and our sales.
prices of certain commodity products, including lumber, copper, energy, and other raw materials, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, inflationary pressures, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations, tariffs and trade restrictions, and periodic delays in delivery. rapid and significant changes in commodity and other prices, such as changes in lumber prices, and our ability to pass them on to our customers or manage them through our portfolio strategy, have affected, and may continue to affect, the demand for our products and our sales.
table of contents tax matters could adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditions.
we may be affected by higher rates of federal, state, or local tax imposed as a result of political developments or economic conditions, which could affect our effective tax rate. our effective tax rate and future tax liability could be adversely affected by regulatory and legal changes, the results of tax audits and examinations, disallowed tax strategies, and changes in accounting principles and interpretations relating to tax matters, all of which could negatively impact our business. changes in tax laws and regulations that impact our customers and counterparties or the economy generally may also impact our financial condition and results of operations.
liquidity and access to capital rely on efficient, rational, and open capital markets and are dependent on our credit strength. our inability to access capital markets could negatively affect our business, financial performance, and results of operations.
we rely on cash flows from operations, as well as continued access to capital markets on both a short-term and long-term basis, as needed, to fund our operations, make strategic investments to support long-term growth, return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, and repay debt maturities as they become due. our access to capital markets depends on our strong credit ratings, the overall condition of such capital markets and our operating performance. if rating agencies lower or place our credit ratings on a credit watch, or if we experience a deterioration of certain financial ratios, it could adversely affect our ability to access the public debt markets and our cost of funds. each of the credit rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically, and there is no guarantee that our current credit ratings will remain the same. disruption in the financial markets, including as a result of rising interest rates, bank failures or other macroeconomic conditions, or an erosion of our credit strength or declines on our credit rating could impact negatively our ability to meet capital requirements or fund working capital needs.
item 7 - management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting our consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources during the two-year period ended february 2, 2024 (our fiscal years 2023 and 2022). unless otherwise noted, all references herein for the years 2023, 2022, and 2021 represent the fiscal years ended february 2, 2024, february 3, 2023, and january 28, 2022, respectively.   fiscal years 2023 and 2021 contained 52 weeks of operating results compared to fiscal year 2022, which contained 53 weeks. we intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain accounting principles affect our financial statements. this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.  this discussion and analysis is presented in four sections:

net sales for fiscal 2023 decreased 11.0% from fiscal 2022 to $86.4 billion. prior year sales included approximately $1.4 billion due to the 53rd week, as well as $5.0 billion generated by our canadian retail business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. comparable sales for fiscal 2023 decreased 4.7%, consisting of a 4.6% decrease in comparable customer transactions, and a 0.1% decrease in comparable average ticket. net earnings for fiscal 2023 increased 20.0% to $7.7 billion. diluted earnings per common share increased 29.8% in fiscal 2023 to $13.20 from $10.17 in fiscal 2022. included in fiscal 2023 results is pre-tax income of $63 million associated with the fiscal 2022 sale of the canadian retail business, which increased diluted earnings per share by $0.11. included in the fiscal 2022 results is $2.5 billion of pre-tax costs associated with the sale of the canadian retail business consisting of long-lived asset impairment, loss on sale, and additional closing costs, which decreased diluted earnings per share by $3.64. adjusting for these items, adjusted diluted earnings per common share decreased 5.2% to $13.09 in 2023 from adjusted diluted earnings per common share of $13.81 in 2022 (see the non-gaap financial measures discussion).
for fiscal 2023, cash flows from operating activities were $8.1 billion, with $2.0 billion used for capital expenditures. continuing to deliver on our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, the company repurchased $6.3 billion of common stock and paid $2.5 billion in dividends during the year.

table of contents persistent macroeconomic pressures impacted our diy customer demand in fiscal 2023, particularly in bigger-ticket purchases. while diy demand remains uncertain, we are committed to highlighting value and convenience, both in our stores and online, to a price-conscious consumer, while maintaining a balanced focus on profitability.
despite lumber deflation, we generated positive pro customer comparable sales for the year, supported by the investments we have made in our pro customer offerings. in addition, our perpetual productivity improvement (ppi) initiatives allowed us the flexibility to control costs and respond to changes in demand. our omnichannel investments enabled improved technology capabilities across our stores, as well as an enhanced customer experience.
the core demand drivers of our business that we track are disposable personal income, home price appreciation, and the age of the housing stock. trends such as millennial household formation, elderly preference to age in place, and a persistence of remote work support the home improvement market, and we believe we are well-positioned to execute our strategic plan. our focus will remain on making the right investments in our total home strategy while executing on our ppi initiatives through the near-term market uncertainty to drive meaningful long-term shareholder value.

fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022
for the purpose of the following discussion, comparable store sales, comparable customer transactions, and comparable average ticket are based upon comparable 52-week periods.
net sales - net sales decreased 11.0% to $86.4 billion in fiscal 2023. the decrease in total sales was driven by the sale of the canadian retail business in fiscal 2022, the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2022, and a decrease in comparable sales. prior year sales included $5.0 billion generated by our canadian retail business, as well as approximately $1.4 billion due to the 53rd week. comparable sales decreased 4.7% over the same period, driven by a 4.6% decline in comparable customer transactions and 0.1% decline in comparable average ticket. comparable sales change during each quarter of the fiscal year, as reported, were declines of 4.3% in the first quarter, 1.6% in the second quarter, 7.4% in the third quarter, and 6.2% in the fourth quarter.
during fiscal 2023, we experienced comparable sales increases in two of 14 product categories: building materials and lawn & garden. strength in building materials reflects strong demand from pro customers while lawn & garden benefited from seasonal demand in the first half of the year. our diy customer categories were impacted by lower diy discretionary demand, particularly in bigger-ticket items, as consumers continue to navigate the macroeconomic environment. our lowest comparable sales were in lumber which were pressured by significant commodity deflation.
gross margin - gross margin as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2023 leveraged 16 basis points compared to fiscal 2022. the gross margin increase for the year was driven by productivity initiatives and lower transportation costs, partially offset by higher costs associated with the expansion of our supply chain network.
sg&a - sg&a expense for fiscal 2023 leveraged 292 basis points as a percentage of sales compared to fiscal 2022. this was primarily driven by cycling the long-lived asset impairment, loss on sale, and other closing costs associated with the sale of the canadian retail business in the prior year, and two favorable legal settlements in the current year, partially offset by fixed cost deleverage due to lower sales.
depreciation and amortization - depreciation and amortization expense deleveraged 17 basis points for fiscal 2023 as a percentage of sales compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to lower sales.
interest - net - net interest expense is comprised of the following:

net interest expense in fiscal 2023 deleveraged 44 basis points primarily due to incremental interest expense related to the issuance of unsecured notes over the past year, partially offset by interest income on our cash equivalents and short-term investments.
income tax provision - our effective income tax rate was 24.1% in fiscal 2023 compared to 28.8% in fiscal 2022. the fiscal 2022 rate was unfavorably impacted by the partial deductibility of long-lived asset impairment and loss on sale associated with the sale of the canadian retail business.

non-gaap financial measures adjusted diluted earnings per share adjusted diluted earnings per share is considered a non-gaap financial measure. the company believes this non-gaap financial measure provides useful insight for analysts and investors in understanding operational performance for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022. adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the impact of a certain item, further described below, not contemplated in the company's business outlook for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022.
fiscal 2023 impacts
•in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the company recognized pre-tax income of $63 million consisting of a realized gain on the contingent consideration and adjustments to the selling price associated with the fiscal 2022 sale of the canadian retail business (canadian retail business transaction).
fiscal 2022 impacts
•in the third quarter of fiscal 2022, the company recognized a pre-tax $2.1 billion long-lived asset impairment of the canadian retail business. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the company recognized additional pre-tax costs totaling $441 million, consisting of the loss on the sale and other closing costs associated with the sale of the canadian retail business (canadian retail business transaction).
adjusted diluted earnings per share should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful indicator of, the company's diluted earnings per common share as prepared in accordance with gaap. the company's methods of determining this non-gaap financial measure may differ from the method used by other companies and may not be comparable.

return on invested capital return on invested capital (roic) is calculated using a non-gaap financial measure. management believes roic is a meaningful metric for analysts and investors as a measure of how effectively the company is using capital to generate financial returns. although roic is a common financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating roic.  accordingly, the method used by our management may differ from the methods used by other companies.  we encourage you to understand the methods used by another company to calculate roic before comparing its roic to ours.
we define roic as the rolling 12 months' lease adjusted net operating profit after tax (lease adjusted nopat) divided by the average of current year and prior year ending debt and shareholders' (deficit)/equity. lease adjusted nopat is a non-gaap financial measure, and net earnings is considered to be the most comparable gaap financial measure. the calculation of roic, together with a reconciliation of net earnings to lease adjusted nopat, is as follows:

financial condition, liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity cash flows from operations, combined with our continued access to capital markets on both a short-term and long-term basis, as needed, remain adequate to fund our operations, make strategic investments to support long-term growth, return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, and repay debt maturities as they become due. we believe these sources of liquidity will continue to support our business for the next twelve months. as of february 2, 2024, we held $921 million of cash and cash equivalents, as well as $4.0 billion in undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facilities.
as of february 2, 2024, our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments consist of leases, long-term debt, purchase obligations, and letters of credit. see note 5, note 7, and note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data", of this annual report for amounts outstanding related to leases, long-term debt, and commitments, respectively, as of february 2, 2024.

net cash provided by operating activities          $8,140                   $8,589
cash flows from operating activities continued to provide the primary source of our liquidity.  the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended february 2, 2024, compared to the year ended february 3, 2023, was primarily due to timing of income tax payments and lower net earnings adjusted for non-cash expenses, partially offset by other changes in working capital. other operating liabilities decreased operating cash flows $2.1 billion for fiscal 2023. this decrease is primarily driven by our third and fourth quarter fiscal 2022 estimated federal tax payments that were deferred until the first quarter of fiscal 2023 under the income tax relief announced by the internal revenue service for businesses located in states impacted by hurricane ian. inventory increased operating cash flow for fiscal 2023 by approximately $1.6 billion compared to a decrease of $2.6 billion in fiscal 2022. inventory declined in the current year as we managed inventory replenishment in line with sales trends and improved the timing of the spring product build.

total debt in fiscal 2023, we issued $3.0 billion of unsecured notes in march 2023, the proceeds of which were designated for general corporate purposes. also in fiscal 2023, we paid approximately $500 million due to the scheduled payoff of notes at maturity.
we have a $2.0 billion five-year unsecured revolving third amended and restated credit agreement (the third amended and restated credit agreement), with a syndicate of banks, which has a maturity date of december 2026 and an aggregate availability of $2.0 billion. we also have a $2.0 billion five-year unsecured revolving amended and restated credit agreement dated september 1, 2023 (the 2023 credit agreement), with a syndicate of banks, which has a maturity date of september 2028 and an aggregate availability of $2.0 billion. subject to obtaining commitments from the lenders and satisfying other conditions specified in the third amended and restated credit agreement and the 2023 credit agreement (collectively, the credit agreements), the company may increase the combined aggregate availability of the credit agreements by an additional $1.0 billion.
the credit agreements support our commercial paper program. the amount available to be drawn under the credit agreements is reduced by the amount of borrowings under our commercial paper program. there were no outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program or credit agreements as of february 2, 2024. total combined availability under the credit agreements as of february 2, 2024, was $4.0 billion. outstanding borrowings under the company's commercial paper program were $499 million, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.78%, as of february 3, 2023. there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreements as of february 3, 2023.
the third amended and restated credit agreement and the 2023 credit agreement contain customary representations, warranties, and covenants. we were in compliance with those covenants as of february 2, 2024.

capital resources we expect to continue to have access to the capital markets on both short-term and long-term bases when needed for liquidity purposes by issuing commercial paper or new long-term debt. the availability and the borrowing costs of these funds could be adversely affected, however, by a downgrade of our debt ratings or a deterioration of certain financial ratios.  the table below reflects our debt ratings by standard & poor's (s&p) and moody's as of march 25, 2024, which is disclosed to provide an enhanced understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effect of our ratings on our cost of funds.  our debt ratings have enabled, and should continue to enable, us the option to refinance our debt as it becomes due. our commercial paper and senior debt ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this annual report requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  we base these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.  actual results may differ from these estimates.
our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included herein.  we believe that the following accounting policies affect the most significant estimates and management judgments used in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
merchandise inventory description we record an obsolete inventory reserve for the anticipated loss associated with selling inventories below cost.  this reserve is based on our current knowledge with respect to inventory levels, sales trends and historical experience.  during fiscal 2023, our reserve increased approximately $106 million to $245 million as of february 2, 2024.
we also record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories.  this reserve is based primarily on actual shrink results from previous physical inventories.  during fiscal 2023, the inventory shrink reserve decreased approximately $3 million to $425 million as of february 2, 2024.
in addition, we receive funds from vendors in the normal course of business, principally as a result of purchase volumes, early payments, or sales-based promotions of vendors' products.  generally, these vendor funds do not represent the reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs that we incurred to sell the vendor's product.  the majority of the vendor funds associated with these purchases are earned under agreements that are negotiated on an annual basis or shorter. the funds are recorded as a reduction to the cost of inventory as they are earned. as the related inventory is sold, the amounts are recorded as a reduction to cost of sales. funds that are determined to be reimbursements of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors' products are recorded as an offset to the related expense.
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate we do not believe that our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term in excess of our established reserves, and we have the ability to adjust purchasing practices based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions. however, changes in consumer purchasing patterns or a deterioration in product quality could result in the need for additional reserves.  likewise, changes in the estimated shrink reserve may be necessary, based on the timing and results of physical inventories.  we also apply judgment in the determination of obsolete inventory and assumptions about net realizable value.
for vendor funds, we develop accrual rates based on the provisions of the agreements in place.  due to the diversity of the individual vendor agreements, we perform analyses and review historical purchase trends and volumes throughout the year, adjust accrual rates as appropriate and confirm actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are appropriately recorded.  amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected purchase volumes, especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserves for obsolete inventory or inventory shrinkage during the past three fiscal years.  we believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for both of these inventory reserves.  however, it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded reserves. a 10% change in either the amount of products considered obsolete or the weighted average estimated loss rate used in the calculation of our obsolete inventory reserve would each have affected net earnings by approximately $18 million for fiscal 2023. a 10% change in the estimated shrinkage rate included in the calculation of our inventory shrink reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately $32 million for fiscal 2023.
we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize vendor funds during the past three fiscal years.  if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used, we could be exposed to additional adjustments that could positively or negatively impact gross margin and inventory.  however, substantially all receivables table of contents associated with these activities do not require subjective long-term estimates because they are collected within the following fiscal year.  adjustments to gross margin and inventory in the following fiscal year have historically not been material.
long-lived asset impairment description we review the carrying amounts of long-lived assets whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. when evaluating long-lived assets for impairment, our asset group is generally at an individual location level, as that is the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable. cash flows for individual locations do not include an allocation of corporate overhead.
we evaluate locations for triggering events relating to long-lived asset impairment on a quarterly basis to determine when a location's assets may not be recoverable. for operating locations, our primary indicator that assets may not be recoverable is consistently negative cash flow for a twelve-month period for those locations that have been open in the same location for a sufficient period of time to allow for meaningful analysis of ongoing operating results. management also monitors other factors when evaluating operating locations for impairment, including individual locations' execution of their operating plans and local market conditions, including incursion, which is the opening of either other lowe's locations or those of a direct competitor within the same market. we also consider there to be a triggering event when there is a current expectation that it is more likely than not that a given location will be closed or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life.
during the third quarter of fiscal 2022, the company determined it was more likely than not that the assets within the canadian retail business would be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of their previously estimated useful lives and were evaluated for recoverability. based on the proposed transaction, the company reconsidered the appropriate asset grouping of long-lived assets attributable to the company's canadian locations given the change in the company's expectations regarding use and disposition of its associated assets. the company determined the total canada retail business (canada asset group) to be the appropriate asset group for which canadian business assets should be evaluated, as this represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. changes in asset group determinations are accounted for on a prospective basis.
a potential impairment has occurred if the fair value of the asset group is less than the asset group's carrying value. the carrying value of an operating location's asset group includes inventory, property, operating and finance lease right-of-use assets and operating liabilities including accounts payables, accrued compensation, and operating lease liabilities. financial and non-operating liabilities are excluded from the carrying value of the asset group. when determining the stream of projected future cash flows associated with an individual operating location, management makes assumptions, incorporating local market conditions about key store variables including sales growth rates, gross margin and controllable expenses, such as store payroll and operating expense, as well as asset residual values or lease rates. operating lease payments are included in the projected future cash flows. financing lease payments are excluded from the projected future cash flows. an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the operating location is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value.
the carrying value of the canada asset group included substantially all assets and liabilities of the canadian retail business, including accounts receivable, inventory, property, operating and finance lease right-of-use assets, definite-lived intangible assets, operating liabilities including accounts payable and accrued compensation, and operating and finance lease liabilities. the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment balance was excluded from the carrying value of the canada asset group in evaluating the recoverability of a held and used asset group.
we use an income approach to determine the fair value of our individual operating locations, which requires discounting projected future cash flows. this involves making assumptions regarding both a location's future cash flows, as described above, and an appropriate discount rate to determine the present value of those future cash flows. we discount our cash flow estimates at a rate commensurate with the risk that selected market participants would assign to the cash flows. the selected market participants represent a group of other retailers with a market footprint similar in size to ours.
we use a market approach to determine the fair value of our individual locations identified for sale or closure. this involves making assumptions regarding the estimated selling prices or estimated lease rates by obtaining information from property brokers or appraisers in the specific markets being evaluated. the information includes comparable sales of similar assets and assumptions about demand in the market for purchase or lease of these assets. a market approach of an orderly transaction under current market conditions was used in determining the estimated fair value of the canada asset group, which was based on the proposed transaction price, inclusive of performance-based contingent consideration.
table of contents judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate our impairment evaluations require us to apply judgment in determining whether a triggering event has occurred, including the evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that a location will be closed or an asset will be otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating expected future cash flows, including estimated sales, margin, and controllable expenses, assumptions about market performance for operating locations, and estimated selling prices or lease rates for locations identified for closure. we also apply judgment in estimating asset fair values, including the selection of an appropriate discount rate for fair values determined using an income approach.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions during fiscal 2023, long-lived asset impairment was immaterial. during fiscal 2022, the company recorded $2.1 billion of long-lived asset impairment within selling, general and administrative expenses (sg&a) in the consolidated statements of earnings, which reflected the full carrying value of the long-lived assets of the canada asset group. if the actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments we have made in determining whether it is more likely than not that a location will be closed significantly before the end of its useful life or in estimating future cash flows and determining asset fair values, our actual impairment losses could vary from our estimated impairment losses. in the event that our estimates vary from actual results, we may record additional impairment losses, which could be material to our results of operations.
self-insurance description we are self-insured for certain losses relating to workers' compensation, automobile, general and product liability, extended protection plans, and certain medical and dental claims. we have excess insurance coverage above certain retention amounts to limit exposure from single events and earnings volatility. our self-insured retention or deductible, as applicable, is limited to $2 million per occurrence involving workers' compensation, $10 million per occurrence involving general liability, product liability, and automobile liability. we do not have any excess insurance coverage for self-insured extended protection plan or medical and dental claims. self-insurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon our estimates of the discounted ultimate cost for self-insured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and historical experience. during fiscal 2023, our self-insurance liabilities increased approximately $34 million to $1.1 billion as of february 2, 2024.
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate these estimates are subject to changes in the regulatory environment, utilized discount rate, projected exposures including payroll, sales and vehicle units, as well as the frequency, lag and severity of claims.
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our self-insurance liability during the past three fiscal years. although we believe that we have the ability to reasonably estimate losses related to claims, it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded self-insurance liabilities. a 10% change in our self-insurance liability would have affected net earnings by approximately $83 million for fiscal 2023. a 100 basis point change in our discount rate would have affected net earnings by approximately $20 million for fiscal 2023.

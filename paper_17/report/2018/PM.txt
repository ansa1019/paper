item 1a. risk factors.
the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements contained in this annual report on form 10-k. any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, our operating results, our financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this annual report on form 10-k.
forward-looking and cautionary statements we may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in this annual report on form 10-k and other filings with the sec, in reports to stockholders and in press releases and investor webcasts. you can identify these forward-looking statements by use of words such as "strategy," "expects," "continues," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "will," "estimates," "intends," "projects," "goals," "targets" and other words of similar meaning. you can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.
we cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. our rrps constitute a new product category in its early stages that is less predictable than our mature cigarette business. achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in our securities. in connection with the "safe harbor" provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, we are identifying important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by us; any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements. we elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document, particularly in item 7, business environment. you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion
5
of all potential risks or uncertainties. we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that we may make from time to time, except in the normal course of our public disclosure obligations.
risks related to our business and industry
•   consumption of tax-paid cigarettes continues to decline in many of our markets.
this decline is due to multiple factors, including increased taxes and pricing, governmental actions, the diminishing social acceptance of smoking, continuing economic and geopolitical uncertainty, and the continuing prevalence of illicit products. these factors and their potential consequences are discussed more fully below and in item 7, business environment.
•   cigarettes are subject to substantial taxes. significant increases in cigarette-related taxes have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted in numerous jurisdictions. these tax increases may disproportionately affect our profitability and make us less competitive versus certain of our competitors.
tax regimes, including excise taxes, sales taxes and import duties, can disproportionately affect the retail price of cigarettes versus other combustible tobacco products, or disproportionately affect the relative retail price of our cigarette brands versus cigarette brands manufactured by certain of our competitors. because our portfolio is weighted toward the premium-price cigarette category, tax regimes based on sales price can place us at a competitive disadvantage in certain markets. as a result, our volume and profitability may be adversely affected in these markets.
increases in cigarette taxes are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our sales of cigarettes, due to resulting lower consumption levels, a shift in sales from manufactured cigarettes to other combustible tobacco products and from the premium-price to the mid-price or low-price cigarette categories, where we may be under-represented, from local sales to legal cross-border purchases of lower price products, or to illicit products such as contraband, counterfeit and "illicit whites."
•   our business faces significant governmental action aimed at increasing regulatory requirements with the goal of reducing or preventing the use of tobacco products.
governmental actions, combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking, have resulted in reduced industry volume in many of our markets, and we expect that such factors will continue to reduce consumption levels and will increase down-trading and the risk of counterfeiting, contraband, "illicit whites" and legal cross-border purchases. significant regulatory developments will continue to take place over the next few years in most of our markets, driven principally by the world health organization's framework convention on tobacco control ("fctc"). since it came into force in 2005, the fctc has led to increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and public health organizations to promote increasingly restrictive regulatory measures on the marketing and sale of tobacco products to adult smokers. regulatory initiatives that have been proposed, introduced or enacted include:
•   restrictions on or licensing of outlets permitted to sell cigarettes;
•   the levying of substantial and increasing tax and duty charges;
•   restrictions or bans on advertising, marketing and sponsorship;
•   the display of larger health warnings, graphic health warnings and other labeling requirements;
•   restrictions on packaging design, including the use of colors, and plain packaging;
•   restrictions on packaging and cigarette formats and dimensions;
•   restrictions or bans on the display of tobacco product packaging at the point of sale and restrictions or bans on cigarette vending machines;
•   requirements regarding testing, disclosure and performance standards for tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide and other smoke constituents;
•   disclosure, restrictions, or bans of tobacco product ingredients;
•   increased restrictions on smoking in public and work places and, in some instances, in private places and outdoors;
•   regulation, restrictions or prohibitions of novel tobacco or nicotine-containing products;
•   elimination of duty free sales and duty free allowances for travelers;
•   encouraging litigation against tobacco companies; and
•   excluding tobacco companies from transparent public dialogue regarding public health and other policy matters.
6
our financial results could be significantly affected by regulatory initiatives resulting in a significant decrease in demand for our brands, in particular requirements that lead to a commoditization of tobacco products or impede adult consumers' ability to convert to our rrps, as well as any significant increase in the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements.
•   litigation related to tobacco use and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke could substantially reduce our profitability and could severely impair our liquidity.
there is litigation related to tobacco products pending in certain jurisdictions. damages claimed in some tobacco-related litigation are significant and, in certain cases in brazil, canada, israel and nigeria, range into the billions of u.s. dollars. we anticipate that new cases will continue to be filed. the fctc encourages litigation against tobacco product manufacturers. it is possible that our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation. see item 8, note 18. contingencies to our condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of pending litigation and item 7, business environment-reduced-risk products (rrps)-legal challenges to rrps.
•   we face intense competition, and our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.
we compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, r&d, innovation, packaging, customer service, marketing, advertising and retail price and, increasingly, adult smoker willingness to convert to our rrps. we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business. the competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions, erosion of consumer confidence, competitors' introduction of lower-price products or innovative products, higher tobacco product taxes, higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories, and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products and restricts adult consumer access to truthful and non-misleading information about our rrps. competitors include three large international tobacco companies, new market entrants, particularly with respect to innovative products, several regional and local tobacco companies and, in some instances, state-owned tobacco enterprises, principally in algeria, egypt, the prc, taiwan, thailand and vietnam. industry consolidation and privatizations of state-owned enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures. some competitors have different profit and volume objectives, and some international competitors are susceptible to changes in different currency exchange rates. certain new market entrants may alienate consumers from innovative products through inappropriate marketing campaigns and messaging and inferior product satisfaction, while not relying on scientific substantiation based on appropriate r&d protocols and standards. the growing use of digital media could increase the speed and extent of the dissemination of inaccurate and misleading information about our rrps.
•   because we have operations in numerous countries, our results may be influenced by economic, regulatory and political developments, natural disasters, pandemics or conflicts.
some of the countries in which we operate face the threat of civil unrest and can be subject to regime changes. in others, nationalization, terrorism, conflict and the threat of war may have a significant impact on the business environment. natural disasters, pandemics, economic, political, regulatory or other developments could disrupt our supply chain, manufacturing capabilities or distribution capabilities. in addition, such developments could lead to loss of property or equipment that are critical to our business in certain markets and difficulty in staffing and managing our operations, which could reduce our volumes, revenues and net earnings.
in certain markets, we are dependent on governmental approvals of various actions such as price changes, and failure to obtain such approvals could impair growth of our profitability.
in addition, despite our high ethical standards and rigorous control and compliance procedures aimed at preventing and detecting unlawful conduct, given the breadth and scope of our international operations, we may not be able to detect all potential improper or unlawful conduct by our employees and partners.

•   we may be unable to anticipate changes in adult consumer preferences.
our business is subject to changes in adult consumer preferences, which may be influenced by local economic conditions. to be successful, we must:
•   promote brand equity successfully;
•   anticipate and respond to new adult consumer trends;
•   develop new products and markets and broaden brand portfolios;
•   improve productivity;
•   convince adult smokers to convert to our rrps;
•   ensure adequate production capacity to meet demand for our products; and
•   be able to protect or enhance margins through price increases.
in periods of economic uncertainty, adult consumers may tend to purchase lower-price brands, and the volume of our premium-price and mid-price brands and our profitability could suffer accordingly. such down-trading trends may be reinforced by regulation that limits branding, communication and product differentiation.
•   the financial and business performance of our reduced-risk products is less predictable than our cigarette business.
our rrps are novel products in a new category, and the pace at which adult smokers adopt them may vary, depending on the competitive, regulatory, fiscal and cultural environment, and other factors in a specific market. there may be periods of accelerated growth and periods of slower growth for these products, the timing and drivers of which may be more difficult for us to predict versus our mature cigarette business. the impact of this lower predictability on our projected results for a specific period may be significant, particularly during the early stages of this new product category.
•   we lose revenues as a result of counterfeiting, contraband, cross-border purchases, "illicit whites," non-tax-paid volume produced by local manufacturers, and counterfeiting of our iqos device and heated tobacco units.
large quantities of counterfeit cigarettes are sold in the international market. we believe that marlboro is the most heavily counterfeited international cigarette brand, although we cannot quantify the revenues we lose as a result of this activity. in addition, our revenues are reduced by contraband, legal cross-border purchases, "illicit whites" and non-tax-paid volume produced by local manufacturers. our revenues and consumer satisfaction with our iqos device and heated tobacco units may be adversely affected by counterfeit products that do not meet our product quality standards and scientific validation procedures.
•   from time to time, we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters.
investigations include allegations of contraband shipments of cigarettes, allegations of unlawful pricing activities within certain markets, allegations of underpayment of customs duties and/or excise taxes, allegations of false and misleading usage of descriptors and allegations of unlawful advertising. we cannot predict the outcome of those investigations or whether additional investigations may be commenced, and it is possible that our business could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of pending or future investigations. see item, 8, note 18. contingencies-other litigation and item 7, business environment-governmental investigations for a description of certain governmental investigations to which we are subject.
8
•   we may be unsuccessful in our attempts to introduce reduced-risk products, and regulators may not permit the commercialization of these products or the communication of scientifically substantiated risk-reduction claims.
our key strategic priorities are: to develop and commercialize products that present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to those products versus continued smoking; and to convince current adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke to switch to those rrps. for our efforts to be successful, we must: develop rrps that such adult smokers find acceptable alternatives to smoking; conduct rigorous scientific studies to substantiate that they reduce exposure to harmful and potentially harmful constituents in smoke and, ultimately, that these products present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to them versus continued smoking; and effectively advocate for the development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of rrps, including communication of scientifically substantiated information to enable adult smokers to make better consumer choices. we might not succeed in our efforts. if we do not succeed, but others do, we may be at a competitive disadvantage. furthermore, we cannot predict whether regulators will permit the sale and/or marketing of rrps with scientifically substantiated risk-reduction claims. such restrictions could limit the success of our rrps.
•   we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to differentiate reduced-risk products and cigarettes with respect to taxation.
to date, we have been largely successful in demonstrating to regulators that our rrps are not cigarettes, and as such they are generally taxed either as a separate category or as other tobacco products, which typically yields more favorable tax rates than cigarettes. if we cease to be successful in these efforts, rrp unit margins may be adversely affected.
•   our reported results could be adversely affected by unfavorable currency exchange rates, and currency devaluations could impair our competitiveness.
we conduct our business primarily in local currency and, for purposes of financial reporting, the local currency results are translated into u.s. dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period. during times of a strengthening u.s. dollar, our reported net revenues, operating income and eps will be reduced because the local currency translates into fewer u.s. dollars. during periods of local economic crises, foreign currencies may be devalued significantly against the u.s. dollar, reducing our margins. actions to recover margins may result in lower volume and a weaker competitive position.
•   changes in the earnings mix and changes in tax laws may result in significant variability in our effective tax rates. our ability to receive payments from foreign subsidiaries or to repatriate royalties and dividends could be restricted by local country currency exchange controls.
the tax cuts and jobs act that was signed into law in december 2017 constitutes a major change to the u.s. tax system. our estimated impact of the tax cuts and jobs act is based on management's current interpretations, and our analysis is ongoing.  our final tax liability may be materially different from current estimates due to developments such as implementing regulations and clarifications. in future periods, our effective tax rate and our ability to recover deferred tax assets could be subject to additional uncertainty as a result of such developments. furthermore, changes in the earnings mix or applicable foreign tax laws may result in significant variability in our effective tax rates. because we are a u.s. holding company, our most significant source of funds is distributions from our non-u.s. subsidiaries. certain countries in which we operate have adopted or could institute currency exchange controls that limit or prohibit our local subsidiaries' ability to convert local currency into u.s. dollars or to make payments outside the country. this could subject us to the risks of local currency devaluation and business disruption.
•   our ability to grow profitability may be limited by our inability to introduce new products, enter new markets or improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix.
our profit growth may suffer if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully, to raise prices or to improve the proportion of our sales of higher margin products and in higher margin geographies.
•   we may be unable to expand our brand portfolio through successful acquisitions or the development of strategic business relationships.
one element of our growth strategy is to strengthen our brand portfolio and market positions through selective acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships. acquisition and strategic business development opportunities are limited and present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration, strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings. there is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms, or that future acquisitions or strategic business developments will be accretive to earnings.
9
•   government mandated prices, production control programs, shifts in crops driven by economic conditions and the impact of climate change may increase the cost or reduce the quality of the tobacco and other agricultural products used to manufacture our products.
as with other agricultural commodities, the price of tobacco leaf and cloves can be influenced by imbalances in supply and demand, and crop quality can be influenced by variations in weather patterns, including those caused by climate change. tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls, including government mandated prices and production control programs. changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products could cause farmers to produce less tobacco or cloves. any significant change in tobacco leaf and clove prices, quality and quantity could affect our profitability and our business.
•   our ability to achieve our strategic goals may be impaired if we fail to attract and retain the best global talent.
to be successful, we must continue transforming our culture and ways of working, align our talent with our business needs, innovate and transform to a consumer-centric business. we compete for talent, including in areas that are new to us, such as digital and technical solutions, with companies in the consumer products, technology and other sectors that enjoy greater societal acceptance. as a result, we may be unable to attract and retain the best global talent with the right degree of diversity, experience and skills to achieve our strategic goals.
•   the failure of our information systems to function as intended or their penetration by outside parties with the intent to corrupt them or our failure to comply with privacy laws and regulations could result in business disruption, litigation and regulatory action, and loss of revenue, assets or personal or other confidential data.
we use information systems to help manage business processes, collect and interpret data and communicate internally and externally with employees, suppliers, consumers, customers and others. some of these information systems are managed by third-party service providers. we have backup systems and business continuity plans in place, and we take care to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access. nevertheless, failure of our systems to function as intended, or penetration of our systems by outside parties intent on extracting or corrupting information or otherwise disrupting business processes, could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in a loss of revenue, assets or personal or other sensitive data, litigation and regulatory action, cause damage to our reputation and that of our brands and result in significant remediation and other costs. failure to protect personal data, respect the rights of data subjects, and adhere to strict cybersecurity protocols could subject us to substantial fines and other legal challenges under regulations such as the eu general data protection regulation. as we are increasingly relying on digital platforms in our business, the magnitude of these risks is likely to increase.
•   we may be required to replace third-party contract manufacturers or service providers with our own resources.
in certain instances, we contract with third parties to manufacture some of our products or product parts or to provide other services. we may be unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms for numerous reasons, including government regulations. accordingly, our costs may increase significantly if we must replace such third parties with our own resources.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on form 10-k, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in item 8, and the discussion of risks and cautionary factors that may affect future results in item 1a. risk factors.
description of our company we are leading a transformation in the tobacco industry to create a smoke-free future and ultimately replace cigarettes with smoke-free products to the benefit of adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, society, the company and its shareholders. we are a leading international tobacco company engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes, smoke-free products and associated electronic devices and accessories, and other nicotine-containing products in markets outside the united states of america. we are building a future on a new category of smoke-free products that, while not risk-free, are a much better choice than continuing to smoke.  through multidisciplinary capabilities in product development, state-of-the-art facilities and scientific substantiation, we aim to ensure that our smoke-free products meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements. our iqos smoke-free product brand portfolio includes heated tobacco and nicotine-containing vapor products.
to provide a greater focus on both parts of our business - combustible and reduced-risk products - and to support our transformation toward a smoke-free future, effective january 1, 2018, we began managing our business in six reportable segments as follows:
•   european union ("eu");
•   eastern europe ("ee");
•   middle east &amp; africa ("me&amp;a"), which includes our international duty free business;
•   south &amp; southeast asia ("s&amp;sa");
•   east asia &amp; australia ("ea&amp;a"); and
•   latin america &amp; canada ("la&amp;c").
our cigarettes are sold in more than 180 markets, and in many of these markets they hold the number one or number two market share position. we have a wide range of premium, mid-price and low-price brands. our portfolio comprises both international and local brands. in addition to the manufacture and sale of cigarettes, we are engaged in the development and commercialization of reduced-risk products ("rrps"). rrps is the term we use to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking.
we use the term net revenues to refer to our operating revenues from the sale of our products, including shipping and handling charges billed to customers, net of sales and promotion incentives, and excise taxes. as discussed in item 8, note 21. new accounting standards, on january 1, 2018, we adopted financial accounting standards update asu 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers." we adopted this standard retrospectively to each prior period presented. we made an accounting policy election to exclude excise taxes collected from customers from the measurement of the transaction price, thereby presenting revenues net of excise taxes in all prior periods. our net revenues and operating income are affected by various factors, including the volume of products we sell, the price of our products, changes in currency exchange rates and the mix of products we sell. mix is a term used to refer to the proportionate value of premium-price brands to mid-price or low-price brands in any given market (product mix). mix can also refer to the proportion of shipment volume in more profitable markets versus shipment volume in less profitable markets (geographic mix).
our cost of sales consists principally of: tobacco leaf, non-tobacco raw materials, labor and manufacturing costs; shipping and handling costs; and the cost of the iqos devices produced by third-party electronics manufacturing service providers. estimated costs associated with iqos warranty programs are generally provided for in cost of sales in the period the related revenues are recognized.
our marketing, administration and research costs include the costs of marketing and selling our products, other costs generally not related to the manufacture of our products (including general corporate expenses), and costs incurred to develop new products. the most significant components of our marketing, administration and research costs are marketing and sales expenses and general and administrative expenses.
philip morris international inc. is a legal entity separate and distinct from its direct and indirect subsidiaries. accordingly, our right, and thus the right of our creditors and stockholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is subject to the prior rights of creditors of such subsidiary, except to the extent that claims of our company itself as a creditor may be recognized. as a holding company, our principal sources of funds, including funds to make payment on our debt securities, are from the receipt of
15
dividends and repayment of debt from our subsidiaries. our principal wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries currently are not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions with respect to their common stock that are otherwise compliant with law.
executive summary the following executive summary provides significant highlights from the discussion and analysis that follows.
consolidated operating results
•   net revenues - net revenues of $29.6 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018, increased by $0.9 billion, or 3.1%, from the comparable 2017 amount. the change in our net revenues from the comparable 2017 amount was driven by the following:
net revenues, excluding unfavorable currency, increased by 3.4%, reflecting: a favorable pricing variance, notably in argentina, australia, canada, egypt, germany, indonesia, italy, japan, mexico, the philippines, russia, turkey, and ukraine, partly offset by france, korea, saudi arabia and thailand; as well as a favorable "other" variance attributable to 2018 fees for certain distribution rights billed to customers in certain markets in the me&a region.
these favorable variances were partly offset by unfavorable volume/mix, primarily reflecting unfavorable cigarette volume/mix, notably in australia, the gulf cooperation council ("gcc"), notably saudi arabia and the united arab emirates ("uae"), indonesia, italy, japan and russia, partly offset by pakistan, thailand and turkey. the unfavorable cigarette volume/mix was partly offset by favorable heated tobacco unit volume in the eu, notably the czech republic, germany and italy, as well as korea, pmi duty free and russia, partly offset by unfavorable heated tobacco unit volume in japan, reflecting the net impact of estimated distributor inventory movements.
net revenues by product category for the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, are shown below:

•   diluted earnings per share - the changes in our reported diluted earnings per share ("diluted eps") for the year ended december 31, 2018, from the comparable 2017 amounts, were as follows:
diluted eps   % growth(decline)
for the year ended december 31, 2017       $3.88

income taxes - our effective income tax rate for 2018 decreased by 17.8 percentage points to 22.9%. the 2018 tax items that decreased our 2018 diluted eps by $0.02 per share in the table above represented a current income tax charge of $185 million primarily due to an increase in our final 2017 transition tax liability, mostly offset by a deferred income tax benefit of $154 million primarily due to the recognition of deferred tax assets for net operating losses in the state of new york. the 2017 tax items that decreased our 2017 diluted eps by $0.84 per share in the table above were primarily due to the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act, which was signed into law in december 2017. the change in the effective tax rate that increased our diluted eps by $0.40 per share in the table above was primarily due to the impact from the tax cuts and jobs act, which reduced the u.s. federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, in addition to repatriation cost differences and earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction. for further details, see item 8, note 11. income taxes to our consolidated financial statements.
currency - the unfavorable currency impact during 2018 results from the fluctuations of the u.s. dollar, especially against the indonesian rupiah, russian ruble and turkish lira, partially offset by the euro and japanese yen. this unfavorable currency movement has impacted our profitability across our primary revenue markets and local currency cost bases.
interest - the favorable impact of interest was due primarily to our ongoing efforts to optimize our capital structure following the passage of the tax cuts and jobs act. this included the decision to use existing cash to repay the $2.5 billion principal for our matured may 2018 ten-year u.s. bond, which had a coupon of 5.65%.
operations - the decrease in diluted eps of $0.04 from our operations in the table above was due primarily to the following segments:
•   east asia &amp; australia: unfavorable volume/mix and higher marketing, administration and research costs, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs and favorable pricing;
partially offset by
•   south &amp; southeast asia: favorable pricing, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix, higher marketing, administration and research costs, and higher manufacturing costs;
•   latin america &amp; canada: favorable pricing, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix and higher marketing, administration and research costs;
•   eastern europe: favorable pricing, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix and higher marketing, administration and research costs;
17
•   european union: favorable pricing and favorable volume/mix, partially offset by higher marketing, administration and research costs, and higher manufacturing costs; and
•   middle east &amp; africa: favorable pricing, favorable volume/mix and lower marketing, administration and research costs, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs.
for further details, see the consolidated operating results and operating results by business segment sections of the following discussion and analysis.
tax items and impact of u.s. tax reform we completed our analysis of the tax cuts and jobs act during 2018 and adjusted the 2017 provisional estimates to the final amounts based on our 2017 u.s. federal income tax return as filed. accordingly, in the fourth quarter 2018, we recorded in our income tax provision a charge of $31 million representing a current income tax charge of $185 million, primarily due to an increase in our aggregate foreign cash position used to determine our final 2017 transition tax liability, mostly offset by a deferred income tax benefit of $154 million primarily due to the recognition of deferred tax assets for net operating losses in the state of new york. updates to the provisional estimates have been recorded in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no. 118 ("sab 118").
we estimate that our 2019 effective tax rate will be approximately 23%, reflecting the current analysis, interpretation and clarifications of the scope and impact of the tax cuts and jobs act.
the tax cuts and jobs act has significant complexity, and our final full-year effective tax rate may differ from this estimate, due to, among other things, additional guidance that may be issued by the u.s. treasury department and the internal revenue service, related interpretations and clarifications of tax law, in addition to repatriation costs differences and earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction.

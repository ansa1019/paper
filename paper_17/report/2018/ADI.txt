item 1a. risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report.
disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
continuing uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending, which may cause our customers to cancel, decrease or delay their existing and future orders for our products and make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. significant disruption to global credit and financial markets may also adversely affect our ability to access external financing sources on acceptable terms. financial difficulties experienced by our customers could result in nonpayment or payment delays for previously purchased products, thereby increasing our credit risk exposure. uncertainty regarding the future stability of the global credit and financial markets could cause the value of the currency in the affected markets to deteriorate, thus reducing the purchasing power of those customers. in addition, financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers, distributors or customers could result in product delays, increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges. if economic conditions deteriorate, we may record additional charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
our future revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate.
our future revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors, including:
•   the effects of adverse economic conditions in the markets in which we sell our products;
•   changes in customer demand for our products and/or for end products that incorporate our products;
•   the timing, delay, reduction or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability to manage inventory;
•   fluctuations in customer order patterns and seasonality;
•   our ability to accurately forecast distributor demand for our products;
•   our ability to accurately estimate future distributor pricing credits and/or stock rotation rights;
•   our ability to effectively manage our cost structure in both the short term and over a longer duration;
•   changes in geographic, product or customer mix;
•   changes in our effective tax rates or new or revised tax legislation in the united states, ireland or worldwide;
•   the effects of issued, threatened or retaliatory government sanctions, trade barriers or economic restrictions, changes in law, regulations or other restrictions, including executive orders, changes in import and export regulations or changes in duties and tariffs, particularly with respect to china;
•   the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us, our customers or our competitors and the market acceptance of such products;
•   pricing decisions and competitive pricing pressures;
•   fluctuations in manufacturing yields, adequate availability of wafers and other raw materials, and manufacturing, assembly and test capacity;
•   the ability of our third-party suppliers, subcontractors and manufacturers to supply us with sufficient quantities of raw materials, products and/or components;
•   a decline in infrastructure spending by foreign governments, including china;
•   a decline in the u.s. government defense budget, changes in spending or budgetary priorities, a prolonged u.s. government shutdown or delays in contract awards;
•   any significant decline in our backlog;
•   our ability to recruit, hire, retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our customers;
10
•   our ability to generate new design opportunities and win competitive bid selection processes;
•   the increasing costs of providing employee benefits worldwide, including health insurance, retirement plan and pension plan contributions and retirement benefits;
•   our ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities at efficient levels;
•   potential significant litigation-related costs or product warranty and/or indemnity claims, including those not covered by our suppliers or insurers;
•   the difficulties inherent in forecasting future operating expense levels, including with respect to costs associated with labor, utilities, transportation and raw materials;
•   the costs related to compliance with increasing worldwide government, environmental and social responsibility regulations;
•   new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting standards and practices; and
•   the effects of public health emergencies, natural disasters, widespread travel disruptions, security risks, terrorist activities, international conflicts and other events beyond our control.
in addition, the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and downturns. our business and certain of the end markets we serve are also subject to rapid technological changes and material fluctuations in demand based on end-user preferences. there can be no assurance (i) that products stocked in our inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them, or (ii) that we will be able to design, develop and produce products in a timely fashion to accommodate changing customer demand. as a result of these and other factors, we may experience material fluctuations in future revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share on a quarterly or annual basis. our historical financial performance and results of operations should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance or results. in addition, if our revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share results or expectations do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the market price of our common stock may decline.
our acquisition of linear technology corporation (linear) and the integration of its business, operations and employees with our own may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected, and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the acquisition may not be fully realized, which could adversely impact our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.
we completed the acquisition of linear, which we refer to as the acquisition, on march 10, 2017. the success of the acquisition, including the achievement of anticipated benefits and cost savings of the acquisition, is subject to a number of uncertainties and will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine and integrate linear's business into our business in an efficient and effective manner. potential difficulties the combined company may encounter in the integration process include the following:
•   the inability to successfully integrate linear's business into our own in a manner that permits the combined company to achieve the cost savings and operating synergies anticipated to result from the acquisition, which could result in the anticipated benefits of the acquisition not being realized partly or wholly in the time frame currently anticipated or at all;
•   integrating personnel, it systems and corporate, finance and administrative infrastructures of the two companies while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high quality products and services;
•   coordinating and integrating our internal operations, compensation and benefits programs, policies and procedures, and corporate structures; and
•   servicing the substantial debt that we have incurred in connection with the acquisition.
any of these factors could result in the combined company failing to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, on the expected timeline or at all, and could adversely impact our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.
increases in our effective tax rate and exposure to additional tax liabilities may adversely impact our results of operations.
our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned. our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was below our blended u.s. federal statutory rate of 23.4% calculated under the provisions of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (tax legislation) enacted on december 22, 2017. it was also below the u.s. statutory tax rate of 35% for fiscal 2017 under the previous tax laws. this is primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income. a number of factors may increase our future
11
effective tax rate, including: new or revised tax laws or legislation or the interpretation of such laws or legislation by governmental authorities; increases in tax rates in various jurisdictions; variation in the mix of jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed; deferred taxes arising from basis differences in investments in foreign subsidiaries; any adverse resolution of ongoing tax audits or adverse rulings from taxing authorities worldwide, including our current transfer pricing appeal in ireland; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including executive compensation subject to the limitations of section 162(m) of the internal revenue code and amortization of assets acquired in connection with strategic transactions; decreased availability of tax deductions for stock-based compensation awards worldwide; and changes in available tax credits. in addition, we have a partial tax holiday through july 2025 in malaysia. the ability to extend such tax holiday beyond its expiration date cannot be assured. in addition, if we fail to meet certain conditions of the tax holiday, we may lose the benefit of the tax holiday and/or be subject to additional taxes and/or penalties. any significant increase in our future effective tax rate could adversely impact our net income during future periods.
in addition, any changes in tax legislation and further interpretation of certain aspects of the u.s. tax legislation, which become effective in the fiscal year ending november 2, 2019, may result in changes to long-standing tax principles, which could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities. on october 5, 2015, the organization for economic cooperation and development, an international association of thirty-five countries, including the united states, ireland and uk, released the final reports from its base erosion and profit shifting (beps) action plans. the beps recommendations covered a number of issues, including country-by-country reporting, permanent establishment rules, transfer pricing rules and tax treaties. we continue to monitor these developments. additionally, as a result of the tax legislation described above, we recorded provisional estimates of the one-time adjustments for the re-measurement of deferred tax assets (liabilities) and the deemed repatriation tax on unremitted foreign earnings and profits. the final impact of the new tax legislation may differ from these estimates, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions made, additional guidance that may be issued, unexpected negative changes in business and market conditions that could reduce certain tax benefits, and actions we take as a result of this new tax law.
we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary intellectual property rights, which may limit our ability to compete effectively.
our future success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property. we primarily rely on patent, mask work, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary technologies and processes. despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain, copy, reverse engineer, use or disclose our technologies, products and processes. moreover, the laws of foreign countries in which we design, manufacture, market and sell our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary intellectual property.
there can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. in addition, any of our existing or future patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. as such, any rights granted under these patents may not provide us with adequate protection. we may not be able to obtain foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to our u.s. patents and applications. even if patents are granted, enforcement may not be available or achieved under the circumstances. if our patents and mask works do not adequately protect our technology, our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours. our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents.
we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and strategic partners. we also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies, documentation and other proprietary information. despite these efforts, internal or external parties may attempt to copy, disclose, obtain or use our products or technology without our authorization. also, former employees may seek employment with our business partners, customers or competitors, and there can be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment.
a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems or certain of our products could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation.
we rely on information technology systems throughout our company to keep financial records and customer data, process orders, manage inventory, coordinate shipments to customers, maintain confidential and proprietary information, assist in semiconductor engineering and other technical activities and operate other critical functions such as internet connectivity, network communications and email. our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, employee malfeasance, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. we also rely upon external cloud providers for certain infrastructure activities. if we were to experience a prolonged disruption in the information technology systems that involve our internal communications or our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs,
12
which could adversely affect our business. we may also be subject to security breaches of our information technology systems and certain of our products caused by viruses, illegal break-ins or hacking, sabotage, or acts of vandalism by third parties or our employees or contractors. our security measures or those of our third party service providers may not detect or prevent security breaches, defects, bugs or errors. in addition, we provide our confidential and proprietary information to our strategic partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business.  while we employ confidentiality agreements to protect such information, nonetheless those third parties may also be subject to security breaches or otherwise compromise the protection of such information. security breaches of our information technology systems or those of our partners could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential and proprietary information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage.
long-term contracts are not typical for us, and incorrect forecasts or reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results.
we typically do not have long-term sales contracts with our customers. in certain markets where end-user demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict, some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the product. in other instances, we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demands, which may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis. additionally, our u.s. government contracts and subcontracts may be funded in increments over a number of government budget periods and typically can be terminated by the government for its convenience. as a result, we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales, and we are subject to the risk of lower than expected orders or cancellations of orders, leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog. further, orders or forecasts for products that meet the customer's unique requirements and that are canceled or unrealized orders would, in addition, result in an inventory of unsaleable products, causing potential inventory write-offs, and we may be unable to recover all of our costs incurred or committed. as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products that are subject to these uncertainties, the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial. incorrect forecasts, or reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results.
our future success depends upon our ability to execute our business strategy, continue to innovate, improve our existing products, design, develop, produce and market new products, and identify and enter new markets.
our future success significantly depends on our continued ability to execute our business strategy, continue to improve our existing products and design, develop, produce and market innovative new products and system-level solutions. product design, development, innovation and enhancement is often a complex, time-consuming and costly process involving significant investment in research and development, with no assurance of return on investment. there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and improved products, if developed, will achieve market acceptance. our products generally must conform to various evolving and sometimes competing industry standards, which may adversely affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us to incur significant costs. in addition, our customers generally impose very high quality and reliability standards on our products, which often change and may be difficult or costly to satisfy. any inability to satisfy customer quality and reliability standards or comply with industry standards and technical requirements may adversely affect demand for our products and our results of operations. in addition, our growth is dependent on our ability to generate new design opportunities and win competitive bid selection processes. failure to obtain or maintain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining or maintaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product and could also weaken our position in future competitive selection processes. our growth is also dependent on our ability to identify and penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense. some of our customers in new markets are less established, which could subject us to increased credit risk. there can be no assurance that the markets we serve and/or target based on our business strategy will grow in the future, that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets, that our products, or the products in which our products are used, will achieve customer acceptance in these markets, that competitors will not force price reductions or take market share from us, or that we can achieve or maintain adequate gross margins or profits in these markets. additionally, developing markets, such as the industry 4.0, autonomous driving, artificial intelligence and 5g, require significant investments, resources and technological advancements in order to compete effectively and there can be no assurance that we will achieve success in these markets. furthermore, a decline in demand in one or several of our end-user markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations.
we may not be able to compete successfully in markets within the semiconductor industry in the future.
we face intense competition in the semiconductor industry, and we expect this competition to increase in the future, including from companies located outside of the united states. competition is generally based on innovation, design, quality and reliability of products, product performance, features and functionality, product pricing, availability and capacity, technological service and support, and the availability of integrated system solutions, with the relative importance of these factors varying among products, markets and customers. many companies have sufficient financial, manufacturing, technical, sales and marketing resources to develop and market products that compete with our products. some of our competitors may
13
have more advantageous supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers or suppliers. our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products in markets we serve and entities outside of the u.s., including entities associated with well-funded efforts by foreign governments to create indigenous semiconductor industries. existing or new competitors may develop products or technologies that more effectively address the demands of our customers and markets with enhanced performance, features and functionality, lower power requirements, greater levels of integration or lower cost. in addition, as we seek to expand our business, including the design and production of products and services for developing and emerging markets, we may encounter increased competition from our current competitors and/or new competitors. increased competition in certain markets has resulted in and may continue to result in declining average selling prices, reduced gross margins and loss of market share in those markets. there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors, or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition. in addition, the semiconductor industry has experienced significant consolidation over the past several years. consolidation among our competitors could lead to a changing competitive landscape, which could negatively impact our competitive position and market share and harm our results of operations.
we rely on third-party suppliers, subcontractors and manufacturers for some industry-standard wafers, manufacturing processes, assembly and test services, and transportation, and we generally cannot control their availability or conditions of supply.
we rely, and plan to continue to rely, on third-party suppliers, assembly and test subcontractors, freight carriers and wafer fabricators (collectively, suppliers) to supply most of our products that can be manufactured using industry-standard processes. this reliance involves several risks, including reduced control over availability, capacity utilization, delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, and costs. we currently source approximately half of our wafer requirements annually from third-party wafer fabrication foundries, primarily taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company. in addition, these suppliers often provide manufacturing services to our competitors and therefore periods of increased industry demand may result in capacity constraints. in certain instances, the third-party supplier is the sole source of highly specialized processing services. if our suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver components to us on the time schedule and of the quality or quantity that we require or provide us with required manufacturing processes, we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers, which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers. if additional or replacement suppliers or manufacturing processes are not available, we may also experience delays in product development or shipment which could, in turn, result in the temporary or permanent loss of customers.
a prolonged disruption of our internal manufacturing operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
in addition to leveraging an outsourcing model for manufacturing operations, we also rely on our internal manufacturing operations located in the united states, ireland, the philippines, singapore and malaysia. a prolonged disruption at, or inability to utilize, one or more of our manufacturing facilities, loss of raw materials or damage to our manufacturing equipment for any reason, including due to natural or man-made disasters, civil unrest or other events outside of our control, such as widespread outbreaks of illness or the failure to maintain our labor force at one or more of these facilities, may disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in us being unable to timely satisfy customer demand. as a result, we could forgo revenue opportunities, potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow, we may not be able to service our debt obligations, including making payments on our outstanding term loans and senior unsecured notes.
our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when due, including the significant indebtedness that we have incurred in connection with the acquisition, depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations, many of which are beyond our control. if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our outstanding debt, we may be required to, among other things:
•   seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets;
•   refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness;
•   borrow under our revolving credit facility;
•   divert funds that would otherwise be invested in our operations;
•   repatriate earnings as dividends from foreign locations, attracting foreign withholding and state and local income taxes;
•   sell selected assets; or
14
•   reduce or delay planned capital expenditures or operating expenditures.
such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt, which could negatively impact our financial results. in addition, we may not be able to obtain any such financing, refinancing or complete a sale of assets on economically favorable terms. in the case of financing or refinancing, favorable interest rates will depend on the health of the debt capital markets.
our significant existing indebtedness could also have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes or creating competitive disadvantages relative to other companies with lower debt levels.
the markets for semiconductor products are cyclical, and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices, and conversely, we may not be able to satisfy unexpected demand for our products.
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly. the demand for our products is subject to the strength of our four major end markets of industrial, communications, automotive and consumer. if we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of increased demand for our products, and that demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expect, or declines, or if we overbuild inventory in a period of decreased demand, our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of increased operating expenses, reduced margins, underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges. these capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could also lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results. conversely, during periods of rapid increases in demand, our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the demand. in addition, we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner, procure adequate resources and raw materials, locate suitable third-party suppliers, or respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to demand for new products requested by our customers, and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected.
our semiconductor products are complex and we may be subject to product warranty and indemnity claims, which could result in significant costs and damage to our reputation and adversely affect customer relationships, the market acceptance of our products and our operating results.
semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain defects when they are first introduced or as new versions are developed. failures in our products and services or in the products of customers could result in damage to our reputation for reliability and increase our legal or financial exposure to third parties. certain of our products and services could also contain security vulnerabilities, defects, bugs and errors, which could also result in significant data losses, security breaches and theft of intellectual property. we generally warrant our products to our customers for one year from the date title passes from us. we invest significant resources in the testing of our products; however, if any of our products contain defects, we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders. these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others, including liability for costs and expenses associated with product recalls, which may adversely impact our operating results. we may also be subject to customer indemnity claims. our customers have on occasion been sued, and may be sued in the future, by third parties alleging infringement of intellectual property rights, or damages resulting from use of our products. those customers may seek indemnification from us under the terms and conditions of our sales contracts with them. in certain cases, our potential indemnification liability may be significant. if any of our products contain defects, or have reliability, quality or compatibility problems, our reputation may be damaged, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to customers and could also adversely affect our operating results.
the fabrication of integrated circuits is highly complex and precise, and our manufacturing processes utilize a substantial amount of technology. minute impurities, contaminants in the manufacturing environment, difficulties in the fabrication process, defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process, manufacturing equipment failures, wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional. while we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing, it is possible that some processes could become unstable. this instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
we are occasionally involved in litigation, including claims regarding intellectual property rights, which could be costly to litigate and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties.
the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights. other companies or individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes, and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling infringing products, if those patents are found to be valid and infringed by us. in the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we could
15
be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property, and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement, and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel. we could also be subject to litigation or arbitration disputes arising under our contractual obligations, as well as customer indemnity, warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend those claims or pay damage awards. there can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities, and we may elect to self-insure with respect to certain matters. an adverse outcome in litigation or arbitration could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or on our operating results or cash flows in the period in which the dispute is resolved.
if we are unable to recruit or retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be adversely affected.
our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the recruitment, retention and effective succession of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers. the competition for these employees is intense. the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. the inability to attract, hire and retain key employees with critical technical skills to achieve our strategy, including as a result of changes to immigration policies, could also have a material adverse effect on our business. in addition, there could be a material adverse effect on our business should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel. we do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees.
to remain competitive, we may need to invest in or acquire other companies, purchase or license technology from third parties, or enter into other strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or enhance our existing products.
an element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses, assets, products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings, diversify our product portfolio, expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce, expand our technical skill sets or enhance our technological capabilities. we may not be able to find businesses that have the technology or resources we need and, if we find such businesses, we may not be able to invest in, purchase or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable terms or at all. acquisitions, investments and technology licenses are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including the cost of potential transactions, competition among prospective buyers and licensees, the need for regulatory approvals, and difficulties related to integration efforts. in addition, investments in private companies are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of our investment. both in the u.s. and abroad, governmental regulation of acquisitions, including antitrust reviews and approvals, has become more complex, increasing the costs and risks of undertaking and consummating significant acquisitions. in order to finance a potential transaction, we may need to raise additional funds by issuing securities or borrowing money. we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are superior to the rights of our common shareholders.
acquisitions also involve a number of challenges and risks, including:
•   difficulty or delay integrating acquired technologies, operations and personnel with our existing businesses;
•   diversion of management's attention in connection with both negotiating the transaction and integrating the assets;
•   strain on managerial and operational resources as management tries to oversee larger or more complex operations;
•   the future funding requirements for acquired companies, which may be significant;
•   potential loss of key employees;
•   exposure to unforeseen liabilities or regulatory compliance issues of acquired companies;
•   higher than expected or unexpected costs relating to or associated with an acquisition and integration of assets;
•   difficulty realizing synergies and growth prospects of an acquisition in a timely manner or at all; and
•   increased risk of costly and time-consuming legal proceedings.
if we are unable to successfully address these risks, we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the acquisition, which may have an adverse effect on our business strategy, plans and operating results.
we rely on supplies, services and manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas, which could affect our ability to produce products.
we, like many companies in the semiconductor industry, rely on supplies, services, internal manufacturing capacity, wafer fabrication foundries and other subcontractors in geologically unstable locations around the world. earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding or other natural disasters may disrupt local semiconductor-related businesses and adversely affect
16
manufacturing capacity, availability and cost of key raw materials, utilities and equipment, and availability of key services, including transport of our products worldwide. our insurance may not adequately cover losses resulting from such disruptions. any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities, or those of our subcontractors or third-party wafer fabrication foundries, as a result of fire, flood, natural disaster, unavailability of utilities or otherwise, could result in a temporary or permanent loss of customers for affected products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
we are exposed to business, economic, political, legal, regulatory and other risks through our significant worldwide operations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we have significant operations and manufacturing facilities outside the united states, including in ireland, the philippines, singapore and malaysia. a significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers in international markets, and we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the future. risks associated with our international business operations include the following:
•   political, legal and economic changes, crises or instability and civil unrest in foreign markets;
•   currency conversion risks and exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations;
•   trade policy, trade, travel, export or taxation disputes or restrictions, government sanctions, import or export tariffs or other restrictions imposed by the u.s. government or by the governments of the countries in which we do business, particularly in china;
•   complex, varying and changing government regulations and legal standards and requirements, particularly with respect to price protection, competition practices, export control regulations and restrictions, customs and tax requirements, immigration, anti-boycott regulations, data privacy, intellectual property, anti-corruption and environmental compliance, including u.s. customs and export regulations and restrictions, international traffic in arms regulations and the foreign corrupt practices act;
•   economic disruption from terrorism and threats of terrorism and the response to them by the u.s. and its allies;
•   increased managerial complexities, including different employment practices and labor issues;
•   changes in immigration laws, regulations and procedures and enforcement practices of various government agencies;
•   greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights;
•   natural disasters or pandemics;
•   transportation disruptions and delays and increases in labor and transportation costs;
•   changes to foreign taxes, tariffs and freight rates;
•   fluctuations in raw material costs and energy costs;
•   greater difficulty in accounts receivable collections and longer collection periods; and
•   costs associated with our foreign defined benefit pension plans.
any of these risks, or any other risks related to international business operations, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
many of these risks are present in china. while we expect to continue to expand our business and operations in china, our success in the chinese markets may be adversely affected by china's continuously evolving policies, laws and regulations, including those relating to trade, taxation, import and export tariffs or restrictions, currency controls, antitrust, cybersecurity and data protection, the environment, indigenous innovation and the promotion of a domestic semiconductor industry, and intellectual property rights and enforcement and protection of those rights. enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be inconsistent. in addition, changes in the political environment, governmental policies, international trade policies and relations, or u.s.-china relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, exposure of our proprietary intellectual property, increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of import duties or tariffs, restrictions on imports or exports, currency revaluations, or retaliatory actions by china in response to u.s. actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results.
at november 3, 2018, our principal source of liquidity was $816.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which approximately $383.5 million was held in the united states and the remaining balance was held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries. we continue to assert our intent to reinvest substantially all of our foreign earnings indefinitely, however we are in the process of analyzing the impact that the tax legislation has on this indefinite
17
reinvestment assertion. as we intend to reinvest substantially all of our foreign earnings indefinitely, certain cash held outside the united states may not be available for repatriation as dividends to the united states in the future. we require a substantial amount of cash in the united states for operating requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends and acquisitions. if we are unable to address our u.s. cash requirements through operations, borrowings under our current revolving credit facility, future debt or equity offerings or other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost, it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are indefinitely reinvested, and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
our operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors.
a significant portion of our sales are through independent distributors that are not under our control. these independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to our products or they could terminate their representation of us. we generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable default or declarations of bankruptcy by these distributors. our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our operating results. termination of a significant distributor or a group of distributors, whether at our initiative or the distributor's initiative or through consolidation in the distribution industry, could disrupt our current business, and if we are unable to find suitable replacements, our operating results could be adversely affected. we have also recently reduced the number of distributors we use, which may exacerbate the foregoing risks.
effective november 4, 2018, all distributor sales will be recognized upon shipment to the distributor under accounting standards update 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (asu 2014-09). upon adoption of asu 2014-09, we will no longer be permitted to defer revenue until sale by the distributor to the end customer, but rather, will be required to estimate the effects of returns and allowances provided to distributors and record revenue at the time of sale to the distributor. if our estimates of such credits and rights are materially understated it could cause subsequent adjustments that negatively impact our revenues and gross profits in a future period.
we are subject to environmental, health and safety (ehs) regulations, which could increase our expenses and affect our operating results.
our industry is subject to ehs requirements, particularly those environmental requirements that control and restrict the sourcing, use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage and disposal of certain chemicals, and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process. public attention to environmental, sustainability and social responsibility concerns continues to increase, and our customers routinely include stringent environmental and other standards in their contracts with us. changes in ehs laws or regulations may require us to invest in costly equipment or make manufacturing process changes and may adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. in addition, we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by potential or actual releases of such materials. any failure to control such materials adequately or to comply with existing or future ehs statutory or regulatory standards, requirements or contractual obligations could result in any of the following, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results:
•   liability for damages and remediation;
•   the imposition of regulatory penalties and civil and criminal fines;
•   the suspension or termination of the development, manufacture, sale or use of certain of our products;
•   changes to our manufacturing processes or a need to substitute materials that may cost more or be less available;
•   damage to our reputation; and/or increased expenses associated with compliance.
if we fail to comply with government contracting regulations, we could suffer a loss of revenue or incur price adjustments or other penalties.
some of our revenue is derived from contracts with agencies of the united states government and subcontracts with its prime contractors. as a united states government contractor or subcontractor, we are subject to federal contracting regulations, including the federal acquisition regulations, which govern the allowability of costs incurred by us in the performance of united states government contracts. certain contract pricing is based on estimated direct and indirect costs, which are subject to change. additionally, the united states government is entitled after final payment on certain negotiated contracts to examine all of our cost records with respect to such contracts and to seek a downward adjustment to the price of the contract if it determines that we failed to furnish complete, accurate and current cost or pricing data in connection with the negotiation of the price of the contract.
in connection with our united states government business, we are also subject to government audits and to review and approval of our policies, procedures, and internal controls for compliance with procurement regulations and applicable laws. in
18
certain circumstances, if we do not comply with the terms of a contract or with regulations or statutes, we could be subject to downward contract price adjustments or refund obligations or could in extreme circumstances be assessed civil and criminal penalties or be debarred or suspended from obtaining future contracts for a specified period of time. any such suspension or debarment or other sanction could have an adverse effect on our business.
under some of our government subcontracts, we are required to maintain secure facilities and to obtain security clearances for personnel involved in performance of the contract, in compliance with applicable federal standards. if we were unable to comply with these requirements, or if personnel critical to our performance of these contracts were unable to obtain or maintain their security clearances, we might be unable to perform these contracts or compete for other projects of this nature, which could adversely affect our revenue.
restrictions in our revolving credit facility, term loans and outstanding debt instruments may limit our activities.
our current revolving credit facility, term loans and outstanding debt instruments impose, and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may impose, restrictions that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company, including to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on our assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and changes in technology, government regulations and the level of competition. in addition, our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. if we breach any of the covenants under our revolving credit facility, the indentures governing our outstanding senior unsecured notes, the term loans or any future debt instruments to which we may become subject and do not obtain appropriate waivers, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable or we may be restricted from further borrowing under our revolving credit facility.
our stock price may be volatile.
the market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future, as it may be significantly affected by factors including:
•   global economic conditions generally;
•   crises in global credit, debt and financial markets;
•   actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and operating results;
•   changes in financial estimates or other statements made by securities analysts or others in analyst reports or other publications or our failure to perform in line with those estimates or statements or our published guidance;
•   financial results and prospects of our customers;
•   u.s. and foreign government actions, including with respect to trade, travel, export and taxation;
•   changes in market valuations of other semiconductor companies;
•   rumors and speculation in the press, investment community or on social media about us, our customers or other companies in our industry;
•   announcements by us, our customers or our competitors of significant new products, technical innovations, material transactions, acquisitions or dispositions, litigation, capital commitments or revised earnings estimates;
•   departures of key personnel;
•   alleged noncompliance with laws, regulations or ethics standards by us or any of our employees, officers or directors; and
•   negative media publicity targeting us or our suppliers, customers or competitors.
the stock market has historically experienced volatility, especially within the semiconductor industry, that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies. these market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our operating results.
our directors and executive officers periodically sell shares of our common stock in the market, including pursuant to rule 10b5-1 trading plans. regardless of the individual's reasons for such sales, securities analysts and investors could view such sales as a negative indicator and our stock price could be adversely affected as a result.

acquisition of linear technology corporation on march 10, 2017 (acquisition date), we completed the acquisition of linear technology corporation (linear), a designer, manufacturer and marketer of high performance analog integrated circuits. the total consideration paid to acquire linear was approximately $15.8 billion, consisting of $11.1 billion in cash financed through existing cash on hand, net proceeds from bridge and term loan facilities and proceeds received from the issuance of senior unsecured notes, $4.6 billion from the issuance of our common stock and $0.1 billion of consideration related to the replacement of outstanding equity awards held by linear employees. the acquisition of linear is referred to as the acquisition. the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10-k include the financial results of linear prospectively from the acquisition date. see note 6, acquisitions and note 14, debt, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information.
revenue trends by end market the following table summarizes revenue by end market. the categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the "sold to" customer information, the "ship to" customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated. as data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. when this occurs, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market.

r&d expenses increased in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017. approximately $147.8 million of the overall increase was a result of the acquisition. the remainder of the increase was primarily the result of increases in operational spending and r&d employee and related benefit expenses, partially offset by a decrease in variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth. the additional week of operations in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 also contributed to the increase in operational spending and r&d employee and related benefit expenses in fiscal 2018.
r&d expenses increased in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. approximately $205.2 million of the overall increase was a result of the acquisition. the remainder of the increase was primarily the result of an increase in variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth and an increase in r&d employee and related benefit expenses and to a lesser extent an increase in operational spending.
r&d expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from year-to-year depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts, which we view as critical to our future growth. we have hundreds of r&d

projects underway, none of which we believe are material on an individual basis. we expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products. we believe that a continued commitment to r&d is essential to maintain product leadership with our existing products as well as to provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore, we expect to continue to make significant r&d investments in the future.

smg&a expenses increased in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 primarily as a result of a $55.5 million increase in smg&a expenses as a result of the acquisition, partially offset by a decrease of $50.6 million in acquisition-related transaction costs, which include legal, accounting, other related fees and integration costs resulting from the acquisition.
smg&a expenses increased in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of the acquisition and acquisition-related costs. approximately $119.8 million of the total increase was a result of the acquisition. acquisition-related costs, which include legal, accounting, other related fees and integration costs resulting from the acquisition, increased $56.9 million in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. the remainder of the increase in smg&a expenses was a result of increases in variable compensation expense linked to our overall profitability and revenue growth and an increase in smg&a employee and related benefit expenses.

amortization expenses increased in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 primarily as a result of a full year of amortization expense for intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition and to a lesser extent, other acquisitions in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018.
amortization expenses increased in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of the purchase of intangible assets as part of the acquisition and to a lesser extent, other acquisitions in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017.
special charges we monitor global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis and continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency, as well as a better alignment of expenses with revenues. as a result of these assessments, we have undertaken various restructuring actions over the past several years.
in fiscal 2018, we recorded special charges of $44.5 million as a result of our decision to consolidate certain wafer and test facility operations acquired as part of the acquisition. over the next two to four years, we plan to close our hillview wafer fabrication facility located in milpitas, california and our singapore test facility. we intend to transfer hillview wafer fabrication production to our other internal facilities and to external foundries. in addition, we are planning to transition testing operations currently handled in our singapore facility to our facilities in penang, malaysia and the philippines, in addition to our outsourced assembly and test partners. the special charge recognized as a result of this action consists of severance and related benefit costs. we expect that this action will result in estimated annual salary, variable compensation and employee benefit savings of approximately $60.0 million once fully implemented.
special charges of $16.9 million, $8.1 million and $13.7 million were recorded in fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively, in an effort to reduce overall operating costs. in addition, in fiscal 2017 we recorded a special charge of
29
$41.3 million related to an early retirement offer action, which we expect will result in estimated annual salary, variable compensation, and employee benefit savings of approximately $28.4 million once fully implemented.

the increase in operating income in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 was the result of a $1.2 billion increase in gross margin, partially offset by a $196.8 million increase in r&d expenses, a $131.6 million increase in amortization expense, an $11.8 million increase in special charges, and a $4.9 million increase in smg&a expenses as more fully described above under the headings research and development (r&d), amortization of intangibles, special charges and selling, marketing, general and administrative (smg&a).
the increase in operating income in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was the result of a $834.4 million increase in gross margin, partially offset by a $314.8 million increase in r&d expenses, a $229.6 million increase in smg&a expenses, a $227.2 million increase in amortization expenses and a $35.8 million increase in special charges as more fully described above under the headings research and development (r&d), selling, marketing, general and administrative (smg&a), amortization of intangibles and special charges.

the year-over-year increase in nonoperating expense in fiscal 2018 was primarily the result of a decrease in interest income as a result of lower invested cash balances in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, and an increase in interest expense related to financing commitments entered into in fiscal 2017 in connection with the acquisition and $750 million of senior unsecured notes issued in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, partially offset by a reduction in fees related to financing commitments which were entered into prior to and upon the acquisition, which terminated during fiscal 2017.
the increase in nonoperating expense in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily the result of an increase in interest expense as a result of the issuance of $1.3 billion of senior unsecured notes in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, $2.1 billion of senior unsecured notes in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and as a result of fees paid and financing commitments entered into in connection with the acquisition, including a 90-day bridge credit agreement in the principal amount of $4.1 billion, a 3-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion and a 5-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion. the increase in nonoperating expense as a result of the increase in interest expense was partially offset by an increase in interest income due to higher interest rates earned on our investments, partially offset by lower cash balances in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016.

our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned. our effective income tax rate can also be impacted each year by discrete factors or events.
the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (tax legislation), enacted on december 22, 2017, contains significant changes to u.s. tax law, including lowering the u.s. corporate income tax rate to 21.0%, implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. as of november 3, 2018, we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the tax legislation. however, as described below, we have made reasonable estimates of the effects on its existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax in fiscal 2018.
the tax legislation reduced the u.s. statutory tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%, effective january 1, 2018, which results in a blended statutory income tax rate for us of 23.4% for fiscal 2018. for the fiscal year ending november 2, 2019 (fiscal 2019), our u.s. federal statutory income tax rate will be 21.0%.
the tax rate for fiscal 2018 was below our blended u.s. federal statutory tax rate of 23.4% for fiscal 2018 resulting from the passage of the tax legislation, primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income and $25.6 million of tax benefit related to the release of uncertain tax positions due to lapses in statute of limitation. similarly, fiscal 2017 was below the then u.s. statutory tax rate of 35%, primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income and a tax benefit of $50.5 million related to the reduction of reserves and related interest resulting from the u.s. tax court's favorable ruling, offset by approximately $98.2 million of tax expense incurred during the year as part of the post-acquisition integration.
in addition, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 includes a provisional estimate for a tax benefit of $637.0 million from remeasuring our u.s. deferred tax assets and liabilities at the lower 21.0% u.s. federal statutory tax rate. fiscal 2018 also includes a provisional estimate of $691.0 million for the discrete tax charge from the tax legislation's one-time transition tax associated with our undistributed foreign earnings, which is comprised of a $755.0 million transitional tax liability less a deferred tax liability of $64.0 million that was recorded in prior years.
additionally, we recorded discrete benefits for excess tax benefits from share-based payments of $26.2 million in fiscal 2018. our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 also included a tax benefit of $15.0 million for the release of a state tax credit valuation allowance as a result of the acquisition.
the tax legislation contains many provisions that are effective for tax years beginning on or after january 1, 2018.  because we are a fiscal year u.s. taxpayer, certain provisions, such as the foreign-derived intangible income deduction on certain foreign-source income and new limitations on certain business deductions, will begin applying to us for our fiscal year ending november 2, 2019 (fiscal 2019).  for fiscal 2018, the most significant impacts include a lower u.s. federal corporate income tax rate, a re-measurement of certain net deferred taxes to reflect the revised tax rates and a new transition tax on the deemed repatriation of certain foreign earnings.
non-u.s. jurisdictions accounted for approximately 75.9% of our total revenues for fiscal 2018, compared to approximately 77.3% of our total revenues fiscal 2017. this revenue generated outside of the u.s. results in a material portion of our pretax income being taxed outside the u.s., primarily in bermuda, ireland and singapore, at tax rates ranging from 0% to 33.3%. we have a partial tax holiday in malaysia through july 2025. a partial tax holiday in singapore had been in place through august 2019, but was terminated effective september 2018 due to negotiations with the economic development board. the aggregate dollar benefits derived from these tax holidays approximated $27.7 million and $27.4 million in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. the impact of the tax holidays during fiscal 2018 increased the basic and diluted net income per common share by $0.07 each. the impact of the tax holidays during fiscal 2017 increased the basic and diluted net income per common share by $0.08 each. the impact on our provision for income taxes on income earned in foreign jurisdictions being taxed at rates different than the u.s. federal statutory rate was a benefit of approximately $434.8 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 7.4% for fiscal 2018, compared to a benefit of approximately $385.1 million and a foreign effective tax rate of approximately 7.8% for fiscal 2017. a reduction in the ratio of domestic taxable income to worldwide taxable income effectively lowers our overall tax rate, due to the fact that the tax rates in the majority of foreign jurisdictions
31
where we earn income are lower than the u.s. statutory rate. in addition, our effective income tax rate can be impacted each year by amounts for discrete factors or events, and acquisition-related accounting adjustments.

the increase in net income in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 was a result of a $826.6 million increase in operating income, partially offset by a $41.9 million increase in provision for income taxes, and a $16.6 million increase in nonoperating expense.
the decrease in net income in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was the result of a $155.5 million increase in nonoperating expense and a $6.0 million increase in provision for income taxes, partially offset by a $27.0 million increase in operating income.
the impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our results of operations during the past three fiscal years has not been significant.
liquidity and capital resources at november 3, 2018, our principal source of liquidity was $816.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $383.5 million was held in the united states. the balance of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries. we continue to assert our intent to reinvest substantially all of our foreign earnings indefinitely, however we are in the process of analyzing the impact that the tax legislation has on this indefinite reinvestment assertion. as we intend to reinvest substantially all of our foreign earnings indefinitely, certain cash held outside the united states may not be available for repatriation as dividends to the united states in the future. if such funds are needed for u.s. operations, we would be required to accrue and pay foreign withholding and u.s. state income taxes to the extent not already subject to taxation. our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, including money market funds. we maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties, continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk.
on the acquisition date, we entered into a 90-day bridge credit agreement that provided for unsecured loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $4.1 billion and borrowed under a term loan agreement consisting of a 3-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion, due march 10, 2020 and a 5-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion, due march 10, 2022. as of november 3, 2018, we have paid $2.1 billion of principal on the 3-year unsecured term loan, paid $1.2 billion of principal on the 5-year unsecured term loan and repaid all of the $4.1 billion of outstanding loans under the bridge credit agreement. see note 13, revolving credit facility and note 14, debt of the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information.
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and dividend payments (if any) in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months.

at november 3, 2018, cash and cash equivalents totaled $816.6 million. the following changes contributed to the net change in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017.
operating activities cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.
the increase in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, was primarily a result of higher net income adjusted for non-cash items, and changes in working capital, primarily resulting from increases in tax liabilities related to the one-time transition tax recognized as a result of the tax legislation.
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, was primarily due to higher tax payments as a result of the post-acquisition integration, and other changes in working capital.
investing activities investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures, investment purchases, maturities and sales of available-for-sale securities, as well as cash used for acquisitions.
the decrease in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, was primarily the result of a decrease in payments for acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease of proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities.
the increase in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, was primarily the result of cash payments made for the acquisition, partially offset by a decrease in maturities of available for sale securities.
financing activities financing cash flows consist primarily of payments of dividends to stockholders, repurchases of common stock, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to employee equity incentive plans.
the decrease in cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, was primarily due to a decrease in net proceeds of $10.4 billion received from the issuance of senior unsecured notes and financing commitments, and lower repayments of principal on the 3-year and 5-year unsecured term loans.
the increase in cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016, was primarily due to an increase in net debt proceeds of $9.9 billion received from the issuance of senior unsecured notes, financing commitments entered into in connection with the acquisition, consisting of a 90-day bridge credit agreement and a term loan agreement, and a decrease in stock repurchases of $323.5 million due to the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program in connection with the acquisition. these decreases were partially offset by payments of $5.1 billion related to financing commitments entered into in connection with the acquisition.

the decrease in accounts receivable for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily the result of the timing of shipments and the collection of receivables.

inventory in dollars increased in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of our efforts to balance manufacturing production, demand and inventory levels. our inventory levels are impacted by our need to support forecasted sales demand and variations between those forecasts and actual demand.
current liabilities decreased to $1.4 billion at november 3, 2018 from $1.6 billion recorded at the end of fiscal 2017. the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the current portion of our debt.
as of november 3, 2018 and october 28, 2017, we had gross deferred revenue of $603.8 million and $589.5 million, respectively, and gross deferred cost of sales of $116.4 million and $115.5 million, respectively. deferred income on shipments to distributors decreased in fiscal 2018 primarily as a result of the distributors' sales to their customers in fiscal 2018 exceeding our shipments to our distributors during this same time period. sales to certain distributors are made under agreements that allow distributors to receive price-adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit, as determined by us, in order to reduce the amounts of slow-moving, discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory. given the uncertainties associated with the levels of price-adjustment credits to be granted to certain distributors, the sales price to the distributors is not fixed or determinable until the distributors resell the products to their customers. therefore, we defer revenue recognition from sales to certain distributors until such distributors have sold the products to their customers. the amount of price-adjustments is dependent on future overall market conditions, and therefore the levels of these adjustments could fluctuate significantly from period to period. to the extent that we experience a significant increase in the amount of credits we issue to our distributors, there could be a material impact on the ultimate revenue and gross margin recognized relating to these transactions.
debt as of november 3, 2018, we had $6.3 billion of carrying value outstanding on our long-term debt. the difference in the carrying value of the debt and the principal is due to the unamortized discount and issuance fees on these instruments that will accrete to the face value over the term of the debt. our debt obligations consist of the following:
$500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.875% senior unsecured notes (2023 notes)
on june 3, 2013, we issued the 2023 notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on june 1 and december 1 of each year, commencing december 1, 2013.
$850.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.9% senior unsecured notes (2025 notes) and $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.3% senior unsecured notes (2045 notes)
on december 14, 2015, we issued the 2025 notes and the 2045 notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on june 15 and december 15 of each year, commencing june 15, 2016.
$400 million aggregate principal amount of 2.5% senior unsecured notes (2021 notes), $550 million aggregate principal amount of 3.125% senior unsecured notes (december 2023 notes), $900 million aggregate principal amount of 3.5% senior unsecured notes (2026 notes) and $250 million aggregate principal amount of 4.5% senior unsecured notes (2036 notes)
on december 5, 2016, we issued the 2021 notes, the december 2023 notes, the 2026 notes and the 2036 notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on june 5 and december 5 of each year, commencing june 5, 2017.
$300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.85% senior unsecured notes (2020 notes) and $450.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.95% senior unsecured notes (january 2021 notes)
on march 12, 2018, we issued the 2020 notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on march 12 and september 12 of each year, commencing september 12, 2018, and the january 2021 notes with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on january 12 and july 12 of each year, commencing july 12, 2018.
the indentures governing the 2020 notes, 2021 notes, january 2021 notes, 2023 notes, december 2023 notes, 2025 notes, 2026 notes, 2036 notes and 2045 notes contain covenants that may limit our ability to: incur, create, assume or guarantee any debt for borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property; enter into sale and lease-back transactions with respect to a principal property; and consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to, any other party. as of november 3, 2018, we were compliant with these covenants. see note 14, debt, of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information on our outstanding debt.
34
$5.0 billion aggregate principal term loans on the acquisition date, we drew down on a 3-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion, due march 10, 2020 and a 5-year unsecured term loan in the principal amount of $2.5 billion, due march 10, 2022. the term loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the eurodollar rate plus a margin based on our debt ratings from time to time of between 0.75% and 1.63% in the case of the 3-year unsecured term loan, and a margin of between 0.88% and 1.75% in the case of the 5-year unsecured term loan. as of november 3, 2018, we have paid $2.1 billion of principal on the 3-year unsecured term loan and paid $1.2 billion of principal on the 5-year unsecured term loan.
revolving credit facility we have a senior unsecured revolving credit facility with certain institutional lenders that expires on july 10, 2020. the agreement for such revolving credit facility (credit agreement) provides that we may borrow up to $1.0 billion. to date, we have not borrowed under this credit facility, but we may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for repayment of existing indebtedness, stock repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other lawful corporate purposes. the terms of the credit agreement impose restrictions on our ability to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. in addition, the credit agreement contains a consolidated leverage ratio covenant of total consolidated funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (ebitda) of not greater than 4.5 to 1.0. the debt covenant will be reduced over time to 3.0 to 1.0, which began in may 2018. as of november 3, 2018, we were compliant with these covenants. see note 13, revolving credit facility, of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information on our revolving credit facility.
stock repurchase program our common stock repurchase program has been in place since august 2004. in the aggregate, our board of directors has authorized us to repurchase $8.2 billion of our common stock under the program. under the program, we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions. unless terminated earlier by resolution of our board of directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program.
in connection with the acquisition, we temporarily suspended the share repurchase program. on august 21, 2018, we reinstated the share repurchase program, and as of november 3, 2018, we had repurchased a total of approximately 148.9 million shares of its common stock for approximately $5.6 billion under this program. an additional $2.6 billion remains available for repurchase of shares under the current authorized program. the repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock. we also, from time to time, repurchase shares in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock units/awards or the exercise of stock options.
capital expenditures net additions to property, plant and equipment were $254.9 million in fiscal 2018 and were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations. we expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2019 to be approximately 4% of fiscal 2019 revenue. these capital expenditures will be funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations.
dividends on november 19, 2018, our board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.48 per outstanding share of common stock. the dividend will be paid on december 10, 2018 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on november 29, 2018 and is expected to total approximately $178 million. we currently expect quarterly dividends to continue at $0.48 per share, although they remain subject to determination and declaration by our board of directors. the payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors, including our financial performance, outlook and liquidity.

_______________________________________
(a)   the tax legislation, enacted on december 22, 2017, contains significant changes to u.s. tax law, including lowering the u.s. corporate income tax rate to 21.0%, implementing a territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. as part of transitioning to the territorial tax system, the tax legislation includes a one-time transition tax that we intend to elect to pay over a period of eight years that begins in fiscal 2019 on an interest free basis.
(b)   certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses. these escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table.
(c)   debt obligations are assumed to be held to maturity.
(d)   these payments relate to obligations under our deferred compensation plan. the deferred compensation plan allows certain members of management and other highly-compensated employees and non-employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of their compensation. the amount in the "more than 5 years" column of the table represents the remaining total balance under the deferred compensation plan to be paid to participants who have not terminated employment. since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals for participants who have not yet terminated employment, we have included the future obligation to these participants in the "more than 5 years" column of the table.
(e)   our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country. the payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected contributions to these plans for fiscal year 2019. the actual future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are not practical because of potential future changes in variables, such as plan asset performance, interest rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels.
as of november 3, 2018, our total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions was $16.8 million, which are included in non-current income taxes payable in our consolidated balance sheet contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. due to the complexity associated with our deferred taxes and tax uncertainties, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the non-current liabilities associated with these deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions. therefore, we have not included these deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table.
the expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information available as of november 3, 2018.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of november 3, 2018, we had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
new accounting pronouncements from time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board (fasb) and are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. unless otherwise discussed, management believes that the impact of recently issued standards will not have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations. see note 2t, new accounting pronouncements, of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual
36
report on form 10-k for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements, including the dates of adoption and impact on our historical financial condition and results of operations.
revenue recognition in may 2014, the fasb issued accounting standards update 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (asu 2014-09), which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states (u.s. gaap). the core principle of asu 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. additionally, the guidance requires improved disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. the fasb has issued several amendments and updates to the new revenue standard, including guidance related to when an entity should recognize revenue gross as a principal or net as an agent and how an entity should identify performance obligations.  as amended, asu 2014-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after december 15, 2017, which is our first quarter of fiscal 2019. we are approaching the final stage of our project plan for the implementation of the guidance. we have reviewed our revenue streams, including those from the acquisition, and are nearing completion in assessing all potential impacts of the standard on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, including any impacts from recently issued amendments, and retrospectively adjusting financial information for prior fiscal years. the most significant impact of adopting the new standard will be related to the timing of recognition of sales to certain distributors. as described in note 2, revenue recognition, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k, we currently defer revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to certain distributors until the distributors resell the products to their customers. upon adoption of asu 2014-09, we will no longer be permitted to defer revenue until sale by the distributor to the end customer, but rather, will be required to estimate the effects of returns and allowances provided to distributors and record revenue at the time of sale to the distributor. we will adopt asu 2014-09, using the full retrospective method, upon its effective date for us which is our first quarter of fiscal 2019.
critical accounting policies and estimates management's discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information. we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. if actual results differ significantly from management's estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements. we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies, such as our policy for revenue recognition, including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user; however, the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective.
revenue recognition revenue from product sales to customers is generally recognized when title passes, which is upon shipment in the u.s. and in certain foreign counties. revenue from product sales to other foreign countries is recognized subsequent to product shipment. title for these shipments to these other foreign countries ordinarily passes within a week of shipment. accordingly, we defer the revenue recognized relating to these other foreign countries until title has passed. for multiple element arrangements, we allocate arrangement consideration among the elements based on the relative fair values of those elements as determined using vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence. we use our best estimate of selling price to allocate arrangement consideration between the deliverables in cases where neither vendor-specific objective evidence nor third-party evidence is available. a reserve for sales returns and allowances for customers is recorded based on historical experience or specific identification of an event necessitating a reserve.
revenue from contracts with the united states government, government prime contractors and some commercial customers is generally recorded on a percentage of completion basis, using either units delivered or costs incurred as the measurement basis for progress toward completion. the output measure is used to measure results directly and is generally the best measure of progress toward completion in circumstances in which a reliable measure of output can be established. estimated revenue in excess of amounts billed is reported as unbilled receivables. contract accounting requires judgment in estimating costs and assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedule. contract costs include material, subcontract costs, labor and an allocation of indirect costs. the estimation of costs at completion of a contract is subject to numerous
37
variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract. changes in contract performance, estimated gross margin, including the impact of final contract settlements, and estimated losses are recognized in the period in which the changes or losses are determined.
revenue from product sales to certain international distributors are made under agreements that permit limited stock return privileges but not sales price rebates. revenue on these sales is recognized upon shipment at which time title passes.
we defer revenue and the related cost of sales on shipments to u.s. distributors and certain international distributors until the distributors resell the products to their customers. as a result, our revenue fully reflects end customer purchases and is not impacted by distributor inventory levels. sales to certain of these distributors are made under agreements that allow such distributors to receive price-adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit, as determined by us, in order to reduce the amounts of slow-moving, discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory. these agreements limit such returns to a certain percentage of the value of our shipments to that distributor during the prior quarter. in addition, such distributors are allowed to return unsold products if we terminate the relationship with the distributor. given the uncertainties associated with the levels of price-adjustment credits to be granted to certain distributors, the sales price to the distributor is not fixed or determinable until the distributor resells the products to their customers. therefore, we defer revenue recognition from sales to certain distributors until such distributors have sold the products to their customers.
inventory valuation we value inventories at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write down inventories to net realizable value. we employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory. while a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory. if actual demand for our products is less than our estimates, additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods. to date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future.
long-lived assets we review property, plant, and equipment and finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. recoverability of these assets is determined by comparison of their carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining estimated lives. if such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property, plant, and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods. evaluation of impairment of long-lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long-lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. these differences could result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in addition, in certain instances, assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased. in these situations, we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives. we review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, on the first day of the fourth quarter (on or about august 5) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. we perform a qualitative assessment on our indefinite-lived intangible assets to determine whether it is more likely-than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. if it is determined that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value, we would compare the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment equal to any amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value.
goodwill goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows. we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis in the fourth quarter (on or about august 5) or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its net book value. if we elect not to use this option, or we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its net book value, then we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. in prior periods, we did not elect
38
to use the qualitative option for assessing goodwill and instead proceeded directly to the quantitative goodwill impairment analysis. the goodwill impairment test requires an entity to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. if fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount of the carrying value that exceeds the amount of the reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. additionally, we consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. we determine the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of the income and market approaches. under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow methodology which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted revenues, gross profit margins, operating income margins, working capital cash flow, perpetual growth rates, and long-term discount rates, among others. for the market approach, we use the guideline public company method. under this method we utilize information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units, to create valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested, in order to obtain their respective fair values. in order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated reporting unit fair values, we reconcile the aggregate fair values of our reporting units determined, as described above, to its current market capitalization, allowing for a reasonable control premium.
in our latest annual impairment evaluation that occurred as of august 5, 2018, we used the qualitative method of assessing goodwill for all eight of our identified reporting units, which we determined are the same as our eight operating segments. for each of the reporting units, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair values were less than their net book values. in making this determination, we considered several factors, including the following:
-   the amount by which the fair values of each reporting unit exceeded their carrying values as of the date of the most recent quantitative impairment analysis, which indicated there would need to be substantial negative developments in the markets in which these reporting units operate in order for there to be potential impairment;
-   the carrying values of these reporting units as of august 5, 2018 compared to the previously calculated fair values as of the date of the most recent quantitative impairment analysis;
-   the current forecasts as compared to the forecasts included in the most recent quantitative impairment analysis;
-   public information from competitors and other industry information to determine if there were any significant adverse trends in our competitors' businesses, such as significant declines in market capitalization or significant goodwill impairment charges that could be an indication that the goodwill of our reporting units was potentially impaired;
-   changes in the value of major u.s. stock indices that could suggest declines in overall market stability that could impact the valuation of our reporting units;
-   changes in our market capitalization and overall enterprise valuation to determine if there were any significant decreases that could be an indication that the valuation of our reporting units had significantly decreased; and
-   whether there had been any significant increases to the weighted-average cost of capital (wacc) rates for each reporting unit, which could materially lower our prior valuation conclusions under a discounted cash flow approach.
business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting, we recognize tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. we record the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the value of the net assets acquired as goodwill. the accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets and the fair value of contingent payment obligations. critical estimates in valuing purchased technology, customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could experience impairment charges which could be material. in addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. if our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed.
we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. we generally determine the fair value of the contingent consideration using the income approach methodology of valuation. each reporting period thereafter, we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating expenses within the consolidated statement of income. changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration can result from changes in assumed discount periods and rates, and from changes pertaining to the achievement of the defined milestones. significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. accordingly, future business and economic conditions, as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above, can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period.

accounting for income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions. we assessed the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of the realization of certain state credit carryovers. in reaching our conclusion, we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to realize deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years. our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in u.s. or international tax laws and other factors. these changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made, which in turn, may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period.
we account for uncertain tax positions by determining if it is "more likely than not" that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities prior to recording any benefit in the financial statements. an uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. this evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in known facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. a change in these factors would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.
in the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities. although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. in the event our assumptions are incorrect, the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. in addition to the factors described above, our current and expected effective tax rate is based on then-current tax law. significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates.
the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (tax legislation) significantly changes existing u.s. tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business. see note 12, income taxes, of the of the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further discussion.
stock-based compensation stock-based compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the consolidated statements of income. determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant-date fair value of stock options and market-based restricted stock units. we calculate the grant-date fair values of stock options using the black-scholes valuation model. the use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of key assumptions such as expected option term and stock price volatility to determine the fair value of a stock option. the estimate of these key assumptions is based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends. we recognize the expense related to equity awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. see note 3, stock-based compensation and shareholders' equity, of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for more information related to stock based compensation.
contingencies from time to time, in the ordinary course of business, various claims, charges and litigation are asserted or commenced against us arising from, or related to, contractual matters, patents, trademarks, personal injury, environmental matters, product liability, insurance coverage and personnel and employment disputes. we periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded. in making this determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. based on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. if a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, we record a contingent loss. in determining the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received from

experts in the specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. if the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations.

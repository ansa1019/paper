item 1a. risk factors the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. if any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. in addition, you should consider the interrelationship and compounding effects of two or more risks occurring simultaneously.
intel corporation's dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit our ability to compete effectively.
intel corporation has been the market share leader for microprocessors for many years. intel's market share, margins and significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to influence customers who do business with us. these aggressive activities have in the past and are likely in the future to result in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for many of our products and adversely affect our margins and profitability.
intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and other marketing programs. as a result of intel's position in the microprocessor market, intel has been able to control x86 microprocessor and computer system standards and benchmarks and to dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of us. intel also dominates the computer system platform, which includes core logic chipsets, graphics chips, networking devices (wired and wireless), non-volatile storage and other components necessary to assemble a computer system. additionally, intel is able to drive de facto standards and specifications for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards.
intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on marketing and research and development than we do. we expect intel to maintain its market position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. to the extent intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to intel's aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products.
as long as intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially adversely affected by intel's:
•   business practices, including rebating and allocation strategies and pricing actions, designed to limit our market share and margins;
•product mix and introduction schedules;
•product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies;
•exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers, retailers and channel partners;
•   de facto control over industry standards, and heavy influence on pc manufacturers and other pc industry participants, including motherboard, memory, chipset and basic input/output system (bios) suppliers and software companies as well as the graphics interface for intel platforms; and
•   marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the intel brand over the brand of its original equipment manufacturer oem customers and retailers.
intel could also take actions that place our discrete gpus at a competitive disadvantage, including giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics market, such as nvidia corporation, preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information. also, intel recently announced that it is developing their own high-end discrete gpus. intel's position in the microprocessor market and integrated graphics chipset market, its introduction of competitive new products, its existing relationships with top-tier oems, and its aggressive marketing and pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us.
we have a wafer supply agreement with gf with obligations to purchase all of our microprocessor and apu product requirements, and a certain portion of our gpu product requirements manufactured at process nodes larger than 7 nanometer from gf, with limited exceptions. if gf is not able to satisfy our manufacturing requirements, our business could be adversely impacted.
the wafer supply agreement (wsa) governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by gf. the wsa is in place until 2024. pursuant to the wsa, we are required to purchase all of our microprocessor and apu product requirements, and a portion of our gpu product requirements from gf manufactured at process nodes larger than 7 nanometer (nm), with limited exceptions. if gf is unable to achieve anticipated manufacturing yields, manufacture our products on a timely basis at competitive prices or meet our capacity requirements, then we may experience supply shortages for certain products or increased costs and our business could be materially adversely affected.
14
in january 2019, we entered into the seventh amendment to the wsa with gf (the seventh amendment). the seventh amendment modifies certain purchase commitments, pricing and other terms of the wsa applicable to wafer purchases at the 12 nm technology node and above by us for the period commencing january 1, 2019 and continuing through march 1, 2024. if we fail to meet the agreed wafer purchase target during a calendar year we will be required to pay to gf a portion of the difference between our actual wafer purchases and the applicable annual purchase target. if our actual wafer requirements are less than the number of wafers required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target, we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit costs, both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and our results of operations.
in addition, gf has relied on mubadala technology investments llc (mubadala tech) for its funding needs. if mubadala tech fails to adequately fund gf on a timely basis, or at all, and if gf is not otherwise able to adequately fund its operations, gf's ability to manufacture products for us could be materially adversely affected.
we rely on third parties to manufacture our products, and if they are unable to do so on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies, our business could be materially adversely affected.
we rely on third-party wafer foundries to fabricate the silicon wafers for all of our products. we also rely on third-party manufacturers to assemble, test, mark and pack (atmp) our products. it is important to have reliable relationships with all of these third-party manufacturing suppliers to ensure adequate product supply to respond to customer demand.
we cannot guarantee that these manufacturers or our other third-party manufacturing suppliers will be able to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements. if we experience supply constraints from our third-party manufacturing suppliers, we may be required to allocate the affected products amongst our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with these customers and on our financial condition. in addition, if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from our manufacturing suppliers, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business.
we do not have long-term commitment contracts with some of our third-party manufacturing suppliers. we obtain some of these manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantities in an existing purchase order. accordingly, we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices. the manufacturers we use also fabricate wafers and atmp products for other companies, including certain of our competitors. they could choose to prioritize capacity for other customers, increase the prices that they charge us on short notice or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
other risks associated with our dependence on third-party manufacturers include limited control over delivery schedules and quality assurance, lack of capacity in periods of excess demand, misappropriation of our intellectual property, dependence on several small undercapitalized subcontractors and limited ability to manage inventory and parts. moreover, if any of our third-party manufacturers suffer any damage to facilities, lose benefits under material agreements, experience power outages, lack sufficient capacity to manufacture our products, encounter financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers or suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions. if we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supplies of products, our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business.
if we transition the production of some of our products to new manufacturers, we may experience delayed product introductions, lower yields or poorer performance of our products. if we experience problems with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from a particular third-party manufacturer, or if we for other reasons cease utilizing one of those suppliers, we may be unable to secure an alternative supply for any specific product in a short time frame. we could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third-party manufacturers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
we are party to two atmp joint ventures (collectively, the jvs) with tongfu fujitsu microelectronics co., ltd. the majority of our atmp services are provided by the jvs and there is no guarantee that the jvs will be able to fulfill our long-term atmp requirements. if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the jvs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business.
failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for our products could negatively impact our financial results.
semiconductor manufacturing yields are a result of both product design and process technology, which is typically proprietary to the manufacturer, and low yields can result from design failures, process technology failures or a combination of both. our third-party foundries, including gf, are responsible for the process technologies used to fabricate silicon wafers. if our third-party foundries experience manufacturing inefficiencies or encounter disruptions, errors or difficulties during production, we may fail to achieve acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays. we cannot be certain that our third-party foundries will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement leading-edge process technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our products profitably or on a timely basis or that our competitors will not develop new technologies, products
15
or processes earlier. moreover, during periods when foundries are implementing new process technologies, their manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive. a substantial delay in the technology transitions to smaller process technologies could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly if our competitors transition to more cost effective technologies before us. for example, we are presently focusing our 7nm product portfolio on taiwan semiconductor co., ltd.'s (tsmc) 7nm process. if tsmc is not able to manufacture our products on 7nm in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.
any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in per unit costs, which would adversely impact our gross margin and/or force us to allocate our reduced product supply amongst our customers, which could harm our relationships and reputation with our customers and materially adversely affect our business.
the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to introduce products on a timely basis with features and performance levels that provide value to our customers while supporting and coinciding with significant industry transitions.
our success depends to a significant extent on the development, qualification, implementation and acceptance of new product designs and improvements that provide value to our customers. our ability to develop, qualify and distribute, and have manufactured, new products and related technologies to meet evolving industry requirements, at prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target markets. as consumers have new product feature preferences or have different requirements than those consumers in the pc market, pc sales could be negatively impacted, which could adversely impact our business. our product roadmap includes our next generation amd ryzen, amd radeon and amd epyc processors using 7 nm process technology. we cannot assure you that our efforts to execute our product roadmap will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers. if we fail to or are delayed in developing, qualifying or shipping new products or technologies that provide value to our customers and address these new trends or if we fail to predict which new form factors consumers will adopt and adjust our business accordingly, we may lose competitive positioning, which could cause us to lose market share and require us to discount the selling prices of our products. although we make substantial investments in research and development, we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement new products and technologies on a timely basis or that they will be well-received by our customers. moreover, our investments in new products and technologies involve certain risks and uncertainties and could disrupt our ongoing business. new investments may not generate sufficient revenue, may incur unanticipated liabilities and may divert our limited resources and distract management from our current operations. we cannot be certain that our ongoing investments in new products and technologies will be successful, will meet our expectations and will not adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results.
delays in developing, qualifying or shipping new products can also cause us to miss our customers' product design windows or, in some cases, breach contractual obligations or cause us to pay penalties. if our customers do not include our products in the initial design of their computer systems or products, they will typically not use our products in their systems or products until at least the next design configuration. the process of being qualified for inclusion in a customer's system or product can be lengthy and could cause us to further miss a cycle in the demand of end-users, which also could result in a loss of market share and harm our business. we also depend on the success and timing of our customers' platform launches. if our customers delay their product launches or if our customers do not effectively market their platforms with our products, it could result in a delay in bringing our products to market and cause us to miss a cycle in the demand of end-users, which could materially adversely affect our business. in addition, market demand requires that products incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry-wide basis. over the life of a specific product, the sale price is typically reduced over time. the introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products is necessary to maintain the overall corporate average selling price. if we are unable to introduce new products with sufficiently high sale prices or to increase unit sales volumes capable of offsetting the reductions in the sale prices of existing products over time, our business could be materially adversely affected.
if we cannot generate sufficient revenue and operating cash flow or obtain external financing, we may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of our planned investments in research and development or other strategic investments.
our ability to fund research and development expenditures depends on generating sufficient revenue and cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing, if necessary. our research and development expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances. if new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors, or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase. if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue, our operating results could decline.
we regularly assess markets for external financing opportunities, including debt and equity financing. additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms. the health of the credit markets may adversely impact our ability to obtain financing when needed. any downgrades from credit rating agencies such as moody's or standard & poor's may adversely impact our ability to obtain external financing or the terms of such financing. credit agency downgrades or concerns regarding our credit worthiness may impact relationships with our suppliers, who may
16
limit our credit lines. our inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail planned investments in research and development or other strategic initiatives. if we curtail planned investments in research and development or abandon projects, our products may fail to remain competitive and our business would be materially adversely affected.
the loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on us.
we depend on a small number of customers for a substantial portion of our business and we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a significant part of our revenue in the future. if one of our key customers decides to stop buying our products, or if one of these customers materially reduces or reorganizes its operations or its demand for our products, our business would be materially adversely affected.
our receipt of revenue from our semi-custom soc products is dependent upon our technology being designed into third-party products and the success of those products.
the revenue that we receive from our semi-custom soc products is in the form of non-recurring engineering fees charged to third parties for design and development services and revenue received in connection with sales of our semi-custom soc products to these third parties. as a result, our ability to generate revenue from our semi-custom products depends on our ability to secure customers for our semi-custom design pipeline, our customers' desire to pursue the project, and our semi-custom soc products being incorporated into those customer's products. any revenue from sales of our semi-custom soc products is directly related to sales of the third-party's products and reflective of their success in the market. moreover, we have no control over the marketing efforts of these third parties, and we cannot make any assurances that sales of their products will be successful in current or future years. consequently, the semi-custom soc product revenue expected by us may not be fully realized and our operating results may be adversely affected.
global economic and market uncertainty may adversely impact our business and operating results.
uncertain global economic conditions have in the past and may in the future adversely impact our business, including, without limitation, a slowdown in the chinese economy, one of the largest global markets for desktop and notebook pcs. uncertainty in the worldwide economic environment may negatively impact consumer confidence and spending causing our customers to postpone purchases. in addition, during challenging economic times, our current or potential future customers may experience cash flow problems and as a result may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products. additionally, if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are unable to secure financing, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that they owe us. the risk related to our customers' potentially defaulting on or delaying payments to us is increased because we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of our revenue. any inability of our current or potential future customers to pay us for our products may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow. moreover, our key suppliers may reduce their output or become insolvent, thereby adversely impacting our ability to manufacture our products. in addition, uncertain economic conditions may make it more difficult for us to raise funds through borrowings or private or public sales of debt or equity securities.
our products may be subject to security vulnerabilities that could have a material adverse effect on us.
the products that we sell are complex and may be subject to security vulnerabilities that could result in, among other things, the loss, corruption, theft or misuse of confidential data or system performance issues. our efforts to prevent and address security vulnerabilities may decrease performance, be only partially effective or not successful at all. we may also depend on third parties, such as customers, vendors and end users, to deploy our mitigations or create their own, and they may delay, decline or modify the implementation of such mitigations. our relationships with our customers could be adversely affected as some of our customers may stop purchasing our products, reduce or delay future purchases of our products, or use competing products. any of these actions by our customers could adversely affect our revenue. we also are subject to claims and litigation related to side-channel exploits, such as spectre, and may face additional claims or litigation for future vulnerabilities. actual or perceived security vulnerabilities of our products may subject us to adverse publicity, damage to our brand and reputation, and could materially harm our business or financial results.
it outages, data loss, data breaches and cyber-attacks could compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information, be costly to remediate or cause significant damage to our business, reputation and operations.
in the ordinary course of our business, we maintain sensitive data on our information technology (it) assets, and also may maintain sensitive information on our business partners' and third party providers' it assets, including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information relating to our business and that of our customers and business partners. maintaining the security of this information is critical to our business and reputation. we believe that companies have been increasingly subject to a wide variety of security incidents, cyber-attacks, hacking and phishing attacks, and other attempts to gain unauthorized access. these threats can come from a variety of sources, all ranging in sophistication from an individual hacker or insider threat to a state-sponsored attack. cyber threats may be generic, or they may be custom-crafted against our information systems. cyber-attacks have become increasingly more prevalent and much harder to detect, defend against or prevent.
17
our network and storage applications, as well as those of our customers, business partners, and third-party providers, may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions.
it is often difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage caused by such incidents. these data breaches and any unauthorized access, misuse or disclosure of our information or intellectual property could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information. cyber-attacks on us or our customers, business partners or third party providers could also cause us to incur significant remediation costs, result in product development delays, disrupt key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources. these incidents could also subject us to liability, expose us to significant expense and cause significant harm to our reputation and business. in addition, we are currently subject to claims and could be subject to additional claims in the future for damages resulting from loss of data from alleged vulnerabilities in the security of our processors. we also maintain confidential and personally identifiable information about our workers. the integrity and protection of our worker and consumer data is critical to our business and our workers and consumers have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information. we anticipate an increase in costs related to:
•   enhancing and implementing information security controls, including costs related to upgrading application, computer, and network security components;
•training workers to maintain and monitor our security controls;
•remediating any data security breach and addressing the related litigation;
•mitigating reputational harm; and
•compliance with external regulations.
we often partner with third-party providers for certain worker services and we may provide certain limited worker information to such third parties based on the scope of the services provided to us. however, if these third parties fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of their networks, our workers' data may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed. a breach of data privacy is likely to cause significant disruption of our business operations. failure to adequately maintain and update our security systems could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain worker confidence. failure to prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information, it outages, data loss and data breaches could materially adversely affect our financial condition, our competitive position and operating results.
our operating results are subject to quarterly and seasonal sales patterns.
the profile of our sales may be weighted differently during the year. a large portion of our quarterly sales have historically been made in the last month of the quarter. this uneven sales pattern makes prediction of revenue for each financial period difficult and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition. in addition, our operating results tend to vary seasonally with the markets in which our products are sold. for example, historically, first quarter pc product sales are generally lower than fourth quarter sales and with respect to our semi-custom soc products for game consoles our sales pattern usually reflects higher sales in the second and third quarters compared to the first and fourth quarters. many of the factors that create and affect quarterly and seasonal trends are beyond our control.
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligations or meet our working capital requirements.
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt will depend on our financial and operating performance, which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, and is subject to prevailing economic, financial and business conditions along with other factors, many of which are beyond our control. we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate cash flow or that we will be able to borrow funds, including under our secured revolving line of credit for a principal amount up to $500 million (our secured revolving line of credit), in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our debt or to meet our working capital requirements. if we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds to service our debt, we may be required to sell assets or equity, reduce expenditures, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing. we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our debt, sell assets or equity, borrow funds under our secured revolving line of credit or borrow more funds on terms acceptable to us, if at all.
we have a large amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations.
our total debt as of december 29, 2018 was $1.3 billion, net of unamortized debt issuance costs and unamortized debt discount associated with the 2.125% notes. our large indebtedness may:
•   make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments;
•   limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes;
18
•   limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes;
•require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments;
•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with relatively less debt; and
•increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.
we enter into sale and factoring arrangements from time to time with respect to certain accounts receivables, which arrangements are non-recourse to us in the event that an account debtor fails to pay for credit-related reasons, and are not included in our indebtedness. we could become obligated to repurchase such accounts receivables or otherwise incur liability to the counterparties under these arrangements under certain circumstances, such as where a commercial dispute arises between us and an account debtor.
the agreements governing our notes and our secured revolving line of credit impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business.
the indentures governing our 6.75% senior notes due 2019 (6.75% notes), 7.50% senior notes due 2022 (7.50% notes) and 7.00% senior notes due 2024 (7.00% notes) contain various covenants which limit our ability to, among other things:
•incur additional indebtedness;
•pay dividends and make other restricted payments;
•make certain investments, including investments in our unrestricted subsidiaries;
•create or permit certain liens;
•   create or permit restrictions on the ability of certain restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us;
•use the proceeds from sales of assets;
•enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates; and
•consolidate or merge or sell our assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety.
in addition, the amended and restated loan agreement restricts our ability to make cash payments on the notes to the extent that, on the date of such payment, a default or event of default exists under the amended and restated loan agreement, or we have not had at all times during the 45 consecutive days immediately preceding such payment, or would not have, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such payment, excess cash availability (as defined in the amended and restated loan agreement) of at least $50 million. any of our future debt agreements may contain similar restrictions. if we fail to make any cash payment on a series of notes when required by the applicable indenture, it would constitute an event of default under such indenture, which, in turn, would constitute an event of default under the agreements governing our other indebtedness.
our secured revolving line of credit also contains various covenants which limit our ability to, among other things, make certain investments, merge or consolidate with other entities and permit certain subsidiaries from incurring indebtedness. in addition, further restrictions apply when certain payment conditions (the payment conditions) are not satisfied with respect to specified transactions, events or payments. the payment conditions include that (i) no default or event of default exists and (ii) at all times during the 45 consecutive days immediately prior to such transaction, event or payment and on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such transaction, event or payment and any incurrence or repayment of indebtedness in connection therewith, the excess cash availability (as defined in the amended and restated loan agreement) available cash is greater than the greater of 15% of the total commitment amount and $75 million. if payment conditions are not satisfied under certain circumstances, we will become subject to various additional covenants which limit our ability to, among other things:
•   create liens upon any of the loan parties' property (other than customary permitted liens and liens in respect of up to $1.5 billion of secured credit facilities debt, which amount includes our secured revolving line of credit);
•declare or make cash distributions;
•create any encumbrance on the ability of a subsidiary to make any upstream payments;
•   make asset dispositions other than certain ordinary course dispositions and certain supply chain finance arrangements;
•   make certain loans, make payments with respect to subordinated debt or certain borrowed money prior to its due date; and
•enter into any non-arm's-length transaction with an affiliate (except for certain customary exceptions).
the agreements governing our notes and our secured revolving line of credit contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross defaults under agreements covering other borrowings. for example,
19
the occurrence of a default with respect to any indebtedness or any failure to repay debt when due in an amount in excess of $50 million would cause a cross default under the indentures (to the extent such default would result in the acceleration of such indebtedness) governing our 6.75% notes, 7.50% notes, 7.00% notes and 2.125% notes, as well as under our secured revolving line of credit. the occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable note holders or the lenders under our secured revolving line of credit to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable. if the note holders or the trustee under the indentures governing our 6.75% notes, 7.50% notes, 7.00% notes or 2.125% notes or the lenders under our secured revolving line of credit accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings.
the markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive.
the markets in which our products are sold are very competitive and delivering the latest and best products to market on a timely basis is critical to achieving revenue growth. we believe that the main factors that determine our product competitiveness are timely product introductions, product quality, product features and capabilities (including enabling state-of-the-art visual and virtual reality experiences), energy efficiency (including power consumption and battery life), reliability, processor clock speed, performance, size (or form factor), selling price, cost, adherence to industry standards (and the creation of open industry standards), level of integration, software and hardware compatibility, security and stability, brand recognition and availability.
we expect that competition will continue to be intense due to rapid technological changes, frequent product introductions by our competitors or new competitors of products that may provide better performance/experience or may include additional features that render our products uncompetitive. we may also face aggressive pricing by competitors, especially during challenging economic times. in addition, our competitors have significant marketing and sales resources which could increase the competitive environment in such a declining market, leading to lower prices and margins. some competitors may have greater access or rights to complementary technologies, including interface, processor and memory technical information. for instance, with our apu products and other competing solutions with integrated graphics, we believe that demand for additional discrete graphics chips and cards may decrease in the future due to improvements in the quality and performance of integrated graphics. if competitors introduce competitive new products into the market before us, demand for our products could be adversely impacted and our business could be adversely affected. in addition, intel corporation has announced that it plans to expand its position in integrated graphics for the pc market with high-end discrete graphics solutions for a broad range of computing segments, which may negatively impact our ability to compete in these computing segments.
in addition, we are entering markets with current and new competitors who may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirements and emerging technologies. we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitors who may have stronger positions in these new markets or superior ability to anticipate customer requirements and emerging industry trends. we may face delays or disruptions in research and development efforts, or we may be required to invest significantly greater resources in research and development than anticipated.
our worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on us.
we maintain operations around the world, including in the united states, canada, europe, australia and asia. we rely on third-party wafer foundries in europe and asia. nearly all product assembly and final testing of our products is performed at manufacturing facilities, operated by third-party manufacturing facilities, in china, malaysia and taiwan. we also have international sales operations. international sales, as a percent of net revenue, were 80% in 2018. we expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future.
the political, legal and economic risks associated with our operations in foreign countries include, without limitation:
•   expropriation;
•changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions;
•changes in tax laws, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;
•difficulties in protecting our intellectual property;
•difficulties in managing staffing and exposure to different employment practices and labor laws;
•changes in foreign currency exchange rates;
•restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions;
•changes in freight and interest rates;
•disruption in air transportation between the united states and our overseas facilities;
•loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs; and
•   compliance with u.s. laws and regulations related to international operations, including export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations and the foreign corrupt practices act.
20
in addition, our worldwide operations (or those of our business partners) could be subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding, typhoons and volcanic eruptions that disrupt manufacturing or other operations. for example, our santa clara operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in california. there may be conflict or uncertainty in the countries in which we operate, including public health issues (for example, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as avian influenza, measles or ebola), safety issues, natural disasters, fire, disruptions of service from utilities, nuclear power plant accidents or general economic or political factors. for example, the united kingdom's 2016 referendum, commonly referred to as "brexit," has created economic and political uncertainty in the european union. also, the european union's general data protection regulation imposes significant new requirements on how we collect, process and transfer personal data, as well as significant fines for non-compliance. also the united states administration has called for changes to domestic and foreign policy. the united states administration has announced tariffs on certain products imported into the united states with china as the country of origin, and we are taking steps to mitigate the impact of these tariffs on our business and amd processor-based products. there is also a possibility of future tariffs imposed by the united states, china or other countries that could have a material adverse effect on our business. any of the above risks, should they occur, could result in an increase in the cost of components, production delays, general business interruptions, delays from difficulties in obtaining export licenses for certain technology, tariffs and other barriers and restrictions, longer payment cycles, increased taxes, restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business.
our issuance to west coast hitech l.p. (wch) of warrants to purchase 75 million shares of our common stock, if and when exercised, will dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders, and the conversion of the 2.125% notes may dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders, or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.
pursuant to the sixth amendment to the wsa (sixth amendment), we issued warrants to wch to purchase 75 million shares of our common stock. any issuance by us of shares of our common stock to wch upon exercise of the warrants will dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders. any sales in the public market by wch of any shares owned by wch could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock, and the anticipated exercise by wch of the warrants could depress the price of our common stock. on february 5, 2019, wch sold approximately 34.9 million shares of our common stock and notified us it would exercise its warrant to purchase 75 million shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $5.98 per share for a total amount of $448.5 million. we expect to receive proceeds of $448.5 million upon the exercise of the warrant and issue the 75 million shares of our common stock to wch in accordance with the terms of the warrant agreement.
also, the conversion of some or all of the 2.125% notes may dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders. the 2.125% notes will mature on september 1, 2026, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased by us or converted. for example, during the fourth quarter of 2018, the sale price for conversion was satisfied as of the end of december 31, 2018 and as a result, the 2.125% notes are eligible for conversion during the first calendar quarter of 2019. any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. in addition, the existence of the 2.125% notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion thereof could be used to satisfy short positions, or the anticipated conversion of the 2.125% notes into cash and/or shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.
uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us.
we typically sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders. we generally do not have long-term supply arrangements with our customers or minimum purchase requirements except that orders generally must be for standard pack quantities. generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. we base our inventory levels in part on customers' estimates of demand for their products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when our products are sold indirectly through downstream channel distributors and customers, as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties throughout the downstream channel.
pc and consumer markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. in addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. we may build inventories during periods of anticipated growth, and the cancellation or deferral of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize, could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins.
factors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of the value of our inventory, a reduction in the average selling price or a reduction in our gross margin include:
•   a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products;
•a production or design defect in our products;
•a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements;
21
•   a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or
•our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressive pricing actions.
the demand for our products depends in part on the market conditions in the industries into which they are sold. fluctuations in demand for our products or a market decline in any of these industries could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
industry-wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future. a large portion of our computing and graphics revenue is focused on the consumer desktop pc and notebook segments, which have in the past experienced a decline driven by, among other factors, the adoption of smaller and other form factors, increased competition and changes in replacement cycles. the success of our semi-custom soc products is dependent on securing customers for our semi-custom design pipeline and consumer market conditions, including the success of the sony playstation®4, sony playstation®4 pro, microsoft® xbox onetm s and microsoft® xbox onetm x game console systems worldwide. in addition, the gpu market has at times seen elevated demand due to the application of gpu products to cryptocurrency mining. for example, our gpu revenue has been affected in part by the volatility of the cryptocurrency mining market. demand for cryptocurrency has changed and is likely to continue to change quickly. for example, china and south korea have instituted restrictions on cryptocurrency trading and the valuations of the currencies, and corresponding interest in mining of such currencies, are subject to significant fluctuations. if we are unable to manage the risks related to the volatility of the cryptocurrency mining market, our gpu business could be materially adversely affected.
our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property.
in the design and development of new and enhanced products, we rely on third-party intellectual property such as development and testing tools for software and hardware. furthermore, certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties. the design requirements necessary to meet customer demand for more features and greater functionality from semiconductor products may exceed the capabilities of the third-party intellectual property or development or testing tools available to us. if the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable, is not available with required functionality and performance in the time frame or price point needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meet customer demands, our business could be materially adversely affected.
we depend on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, software and other computer platform components to support our business.
we depend on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, graphics cards, software (e.g. bios, operating systems, drivers) and other components that our customers utilize to support and/or use our microprocessor, gpu and apu offerings. we also rely on our add-in-board (aib) partners to support our gpu and apu products. in addition, our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with intel microprocessors. if the designers, manufacturers, aibs and suppliers of motherboards, graphics cards, software and other components decrease their support for our product offerings, our business could be materially adversely affected.
if we lose microsoft corporation's support for our products or other software vendors do not design and develop software to run on our products, our ability to sell our products could be materially adversely affected.
our ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by intel depends partially on microsoft designing and developing its operating systems to run on or support our x86-based microprocessor products. with respect to our graphics products, we depend in part on microsoft to design and develop its operating system to run on or support our graphics products. similarly, the success of our products in the market, such as our apu products, is dependent on independent software providers designing and developing software to run on our products. if microsoft does not continue to design and develop its operating systems so that they work with our x86 instruction sets or does not continue to develop and maintain their operating systems to support our graphics products, independent software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase pcs with our products. in addition, some software drivers licensed for use with our products are certified by microsoft. if microsoft did not certify a driver, or if we otherwise fail to retain the support of microsoft or other software vendors, our ability to market our products would be materially adversely affected.
our reliance on third-party distributors and aib partners subjects us to certain risks.
we market and sell our products directly and through third-party distributors and aib partners pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party. these agreements are non-exclusive and permit both our distributors and aib partners to offer our competitors' products. we are dependent on our distributors and aib partners to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts. if any significant distributor or aib or a substantial number of our distributors or aib partners terminated their relationship with us, decided to market our competitors' products over our products or decided not to market our products at all, our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected. in addition, if we are unable to collect accounts receivable from our significant distributors and/
22
or aib partners, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. if we are unable to manage the risks related to the use of our third-party distributors and aib partners or offer appropriate incentives to focus them on the sale of our products, our business could be materially adversely affected.
additionally, distributors and aib partners typically maintain an inventory of our products. in most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions, as well as provide return rights for any product that we have removed from our price book and that is not more than 12 months older than the manufacturing date. some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. our agreements with aib partners protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. in the event of a significant decline in the price of our products, the price protection rights we offer would materially adversely affect us because our revenue and corresponding gross margin would decline.
we may incur future impairments of goodwill and technology license purchases.
we perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year. subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis, we monitor for any events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management's business strategy, an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace, an inability to successfully achieve internal forecasts or significant declines in our stock price, which may represent an indicator of impairment. the occurrence of any of these events may require us to record future goodwill impairment charges.
we license certain third-party technologies and tools for the design and production of our products. we report the value of those licenses as intangible assets on the balance sheet and we periodically evaluate the carrying value of those licenses based on their future economic benefit to us. factors such as the life of the assets, changes in competing technologies, and changes to the business strategy may represent an indicator of impairment. the occurrence of any of these events may require us to record future technology license impairment charges. for example, during the fourth quarter of 2018, we recorded an impairment charge in cost of sales of $45 million on technology licenses related to products that are no longer being used.
our inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel may hinder our business.
much of our future success depends upon the continued service of numerous qualified engineering, marketing, sales and executive personnel. competition for highly skilled employees and executives in the technology industry is intense and our competitors have targeted our employees that have desired skills. if we are not able to continue to attract, train and retain qualified personnel necessary for our business, the progress of our product development programs could be hindered, and we could be materially adversely affected. to help attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, we use share-based incentive awards such as employee stock options and non-vested share units (restricted stock units). if the value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock, or if our share-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, our ability to attract, retain and motivate personnel could be weakened, which could harm our results of operations. also, if the value of our stock awards increases substantially, this could potentially create great personal wealth for our employees and affect our ability to retain these employees. in addition, any future restructuring plans may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain key employees.
in the event of a change of control, we may not be able to repurchase our outstanding debt as required by the applicable indentures and our secured revolving line of credit, which would result in a default under the indentures and our secured revolving line of credit.
upon a change of control, we will be required to offer to repurchase all of our 6.75% notes, 7.50% notes, 7.00% notes and 2.125% notes then outstanding at 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the repurchase date. in addition, a change of control would be an event of default under our secured revolving line of credit. as of december 29, 2018, $70 million of borrowings were outstanding under the secured revolving line of credit, $26 million related to letters of credit under the secured revolving line of credit remained outstanding and $1.5 billion principal amount was outstanding under our notes. future debt agreements may contain similar provisions. we may not have the financial resources to repurchase our outstanding notes and prepay all of our outstanding obligations under our secured revolving line of credit.
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced severe downturns that have materially adversely affected, and may continue to materially adversely affect, our business in the future.
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced significant downturns, often in conjunction with constant and rapid technological change, wide fluctuations in supply and demand, continuous new product introductions, price erosion and declines in general economic conditions. we have incurred substantial losses in recent downturns, due to:
•   substantial declines in average selling prices;
•the cyclical nature of supply and demand imbalances in the semiconductor industry;
•a decline in demand for end-user products (such as pcs) that incorporate our products; and
23
•excess inventory levels.
industry-wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future. for example, a large portion of our computing and graphics revenue is focused on consumer desktop pc and notebook segments. while overall growth in computing and graphics is stabilizing, the areas within computing and graphics are changing. our ability to take advantage of the opportunities within computing and graphics is based on foreseeing those changes and making timely investments in the form factors that serve those growing sub-segments.
global economic uncertainty and weakness have in the past impacted the semiconductor market as consumers and businesses have deferred purchases, which negatively impacted demand for our products. our financial performance has been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by these downturns.
the growth of our business is also dependent on continued demand for our products from high-growth adjacent emerging global markets. our ability to be successful in such markets depends in part on our ability to establish adequate local infrastructure, as well as our ability to cultivate and maintain local relationships in these markets. if demand from these markets is below our expectations, sales of our products may decrease, which would have a material adverse effect on us.
acquisitions, divestitures and/or joint ventures could disrupt our business, harm our financial condition and operating results or dilute, or adversely affect the price of, our common stock.
our success will depend, in part, on our ability to expand our product offerings and grow our business in response to changing technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures. in some circumstances, we may pursue growth through the acquisition of complementary businesses, solutions or technologies or through divestitures or joint ventures rather than through internal development. the identification of suitable acquisition or joint venture candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions or joint ventures. moreover, if such acquisitions or joint ventures require us to seek additional debt or equity financing, we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms favorable to us or at all. even if we successfully complete an acquisition or a joint venture, we may not be able to assimilate and integrate effectively or efficiently the acquired business, technologies, solutions, assets, personnel or operations, particularly if key personnel of the acquired company decide not to work for us. acquisitions and joint ventures may also involve the entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience. consequently, we may not achieve anticipated benefits of the acquisitions or joint ventures which could harm our operating results. in addition, to complete an acquisition, we may issue equity securities, which would dilute our stockholders' ownership and could adversely affect the price of our common stock, as well as incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or have amortization expenses and write-downs of acquired assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations. acquisitions and joint ventures may also reduce our cash available for operations and other uses, which could harm our business. also, any failure on our part to effectively evaluate and execute new business initiatives could adversely affect our business. we may not adequately assess the risk of new business initiatives and subsequent events may arise that alter the risks that were initially considered.
furthermore, we may not achieve the objectives and expectations with respect to future operations, products and services.the majority of our atmp services are provided by the jvs and there is no guarantee that the jvs will be able to fulfill our long-term atmp requirements. if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the jvs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business.
in addition, we may not realize the anticipated benefits from any new business initiatives. we have a joint venture with higon information technology co., ltd. (formerly, tianjin haiguang advanced technology investment co., ltd.) (thatic), comprised of two separate legal entities, china jv1 and china jv2 (collectively, the thatic jv). we may not realize the expected benefits from this joint venture, including the thatic jv's expected future performance, the receipt of any future milestone payments from certain licensed intellectual property, and the receipt of any royalty payments from future sales of products by the thatic jv.
our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls.
we rely upon a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key business functions, and the efficient operation of these processes and systems is critical to our business. our business processes and information systems need to be sufficiently scalable to support the growth of our business and may require modifications or upgrades that expose us to a number of operational risks. as such, our information systems will continually evolve and adapt in order to meet our business needs. these changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time.
these changes may also require changes in our information systems, modification of internal control procedures and significant training of employees and third-party resources. we continuously work on simplifying our information systems and applications through consolidation and standardization efforts. there can be no assurance that our business and operations will not experience any disruption in connection with this transition. our information technology systems, and those of third-party information technology providers or business partners, may also be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control including catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, viruses or malware, cyber-
24
attacks, data breaches and computer system or network failures, exposing us to significant cost, reputational harm and disruption or damage to our business.
in addition, as our it environment continues to evolve, we are embracing new ways of communicating and sharing data internally and externally with customers and partners using methods such as mobility and the cloud that can promote business efficiency. however, these practices can also result in a more distributed it environment, making it more difficult for us to maintain visibility and control over internal and external users, and meet scalability and administrative requirements. if our security controls cannot keep pace with the speed of these changes, or if we are not able to meet regulatory and compliance requirements, our business would be materially adversely affected.
if essential equipment, materials or manufacturing processes are not available to manufacture our products, we could be materially adversely affected.
we may purchase equipment and materials for use by our back-end manufacturing service providers from a number of suppliers and our operations depend upon obtaining deliveries of adequate supplies of equipment and materials on a timely basis. our third-party suppliers also depend on the same timely delivery of adequate quantities of equipment and materials in the manufacture of our products. in addition, as many of our products increase in technical complexity, we rely on our third-party suppliers to update their processes in order to continue meeting our back-end manufacturing needs. certain equipment and materials that are used in the manufacture of our products are available only from a limited number of suppliers, or in some cases, a sole supplier. we also depend on a limited number of suppliers to provide the majority of certain types of integrated circuit packages for our microprocessors, including our apu products. similarly, certain non-proprietary materials or components such as memory, printed circuit boards (pcbs), interposers, substrates and capacitors used in the manufacture of our products are currently available from only a limited number of sources. because some of the equipment and materials that we and our third-party manufacturing suppliers purchase are complex, it is sometimes difficult to substitute one supplier for another. from time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supply or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. also, some of these materials and components may be subject to rapid changes in price and availability. interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials. dependence on a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers exacerbates these risks. if we are unable to procure certain of these materials for our back-end manufacturing operations, or our third-party foundries or manufacturing suppliers are unable to procure materials for manufacturing our products, our business would be materially adversely affected.
if our products are not compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware, we could be materially adversely affected.
our products may not be fully compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware. further, we may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility problems in a timely manner. if our customers are unable to achieve compatibility with software or hardware, we could be materially adversely affected. in addition, the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem relating to our products could have a material adverse effect on our business.
costs related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us.
products as complex as those we offer may contain defects or failures when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements to existing products are released. we cannot assure you that, despite our testing procedures, errors will not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments in the future, which could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products, material recall and replacement costs, loss of revenue, writing down the inventory of defective products, the diversion of the attention of our engineering personnel from product development efforts, defending against litigation related to defective products or related liabilities, including property damage, personal injury, damage to our reputation in the industry and loss of data or intangible property, and could adversely affect our relationships with our customers. in addition, we may have difficulty identifying the end customers of the defective products in the field. as a result, we could incur substantial costs to implement modifications to correct defects. any of these problems could materially adversely affect our business.
we could be subject to potential product liability claims if one of our products causes, or merely appears to have caused, an injury, whether tangible or intangible. claims may be made by consumers or others selling our products, and we may be subject to claims against us even if an alleged injury is due to the actions of others. a product liability claim, recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business.
if we fail to maintain the efficiency of our supply chain as we respond to changes in customer demand for our products, our business could be materially adversely affected.
our ability to meet customer demand for our products depends, in part, on our ability to deliver the products our customers want on a timely basis. accordingly, we rely on our supply chain for the manufacturing, distribution and fulfillment of our products. as we continue to grow our business, expand to high-growth adjacent markets, acquire new customers and strengthen relationships with existing customers, the efficiency of our supply chain will become increasingly important because many of our customers tend to have specific requirements for particular products, and specific time-frames in which they require delivery
25
of these products. if we are unable to consistently deliver the right products to our customers on a timely basis in the right locations, our customers may reduce the quantities they order from us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
we outsource to third parties certain supply-chain logistics functions, including portions of our product distribution, transportation management and information technology support services.
we rely on third-party providers to operate our regional product distribution centers and to manage the transportation of our work-in-process and finished products among our facilities, to our manufacturing suppliers and to our customers. in addition, we rely on third parties to provide certain information technology services to us, including help desk support, desktop application services, business and software support applications, server and storage administration, datacenter operations, database administration and voice, video and remote access. we cannot guarantee that these providers will fulfill their respective responsibilities in a timely manner in accordance with the contract terms, in which case our internal operations and the distribution of our products to our customers could be materially adversely affected. also, we cannot guarantee that our contracts with these third-party providers will be renewed, in which case we would have to transition these functions in-house or secure new providers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business if the transition is not executed appropriately.
our stock price is subject to volatility.
our stock price has experienced price and volume fluctuations and could be subject to wide fluctuations in the future. the trading price of our stock may fluctuate widely due to various factors including, actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial conditions and operating results, changes in financial estimates by us or financial estimates and ratings by securities analysts, changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public, interest rate changes, news regarding our products or products of our competitors, and broad market and industry fluctuations. stock price fluctuations could impact the value of our equity compensation, which could affect our ability to recruit and retain employees. in addition, volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities.
worldwide political conditions may adversely affect demand for our products.
worldwide political conditions may create uncertainties that could adversely affect our business. the united states has been and may continue to be involved in armed conflicts that could have a further impact on our sales and our supply chain. the consequences of armed conflict, political instability or civil or military unrest are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us. terrorist attacks or other hostile acts may negatively affect our operations, or adversely affect demand for our products, and such attacks or related armed conflicts may impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. furthermore, these attacks or hostile acts may make travel and the transportation of our products more difficult and more expensive, which could materially adversely affect us. any of these events could cause consumer spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the united states economy and worldwide financial markets.
unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect us.
we have costs, assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies. as a consequence, movements in exchange rates could cause our foreign currency denominated expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue, affecting our profitability and cash flows. whenever we believe appropriate, we hedge a portion of our short-term foreign currency exposure to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates. we determine our total foreign currency exposure using projections of long-term expenditures for items such as payroll. we cannot assure you that these activities will be effective in reducing foreign exchange rate exposure. failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. in addition, the majority of our product sales are denominated in u.s. dollars. fluctuations in the exchange rate between the u.s. dollar and the local currency can cause increases or decreases in the cost of our products in the local currency of such customers. an appreciation of the u.s. dollar relative to the local currency could reduce sales of our products.
our inability to effectively control the sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us.
we market and sell our products directly to oems and through authorized third-party distributors. from time to time, our products are diverted from our authorized distribution channels and are sold on the "gray market." gray market products result in shadow inventory that is not visible to us, thus making it difficult to forecast demand accurately. also, when gray market products enter the market, we and our distribution channels compete with these heavily discounted gray market products, which adversely affects demand for our products and negatively impact our margins. in addition, our inability to control gray market activities could result in customer satisfaction issues because any time products are purchased outside our authorized distribution channels there is a risk that our customers are buying counterfeit or substandard products, including products that may have been altered, mishandled or damaged, or are used products represented as new.
26
if we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property in the united states and abroad, through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other measures, we may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses.
we rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts, including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements, copyrights, patents, trademarks and common law rights, such as trade secrets, to protect our intellectual property. however, we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property from third-party infringement or from misappropriation in the united states and abroad. any patent licensed by us or issued to us could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or rights granted there under may not provide a competitive advantage to us.
furthermore, patent applications that we file may not result in issuance of a patent or, if a patent is issued, the patent may not be issued in a form that is advantageous to us. despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, others may independently develop similar products, duplicate our products or design around our patents and other rights. in addition, it is difficult to monitor compliance with, and enforce, our intellectual property on a worldwide basis in a cost-effective manner. in jurisdictions where foreign laws provide less intellectual property protection than afforded in the united states and abroad, our technology or other intellectual property may be compromised, and our business would be materially adversely affected.
we are party to litigation and may become a party to other claims or litigation that could cause us to incur substantial costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit us from selling our products.
from time to time, we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions. for example, as described in note 19 of our consolidated financial statements, we have been subject to certain claims concerning federal securities laws and corporate governance. our products are purchased by and/or used by consumers, which could increase our exposure to consumer actions such as product liability claims and consumer class action claims, including those described in note 19 of our consolidated financial statements. on occasion, we receive claims that individuals were allegedly exposed to substances used in our former semiconductor wafer manufacturing facilities and that this alleged exposure caused harm. litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions, and its outcome is uncertain. it is possible that if a claim is successfully asserted against us, including the claims described in note 19 of our consolidated financial statements, it could result in the payment of damages that could be material to our business.
with respect to intellectual property litigation, from time to time, we have been notified of, or third parties may bring or have brought, actions against us and/or against our customers based on allegations that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others, contributing to or inducing the infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, improperly claiming ownership of intellectual property or otherwise improperly using the intellectual property of others. if any such claims are asserted, we may seek to obtain a license under the third parties' intellectual property rights. we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain all of the necessary licenses on satisfactory terms, if at all. these parties may file lawsuits against us or our customers seeking damages (potentially up to and including treble damages) or an injunction against the sale of products that incorporate allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of our business as presently conducted, which could result in our having to stop the sale of some of our products or to increase the costs of selling some of our products or which could damage our reputation. the award of damages, including material royalty payments, or other types of damages, or the entry of an injunction against the manufacture and sale of some or all of our products could have a material adverse effect on us. we could decide, in the alternative, to redesign our products or to resort to litigation to challenge such claims. such challenges could be extremely expensive and time-consuming regardless of their merit, could cause delays in product release or shipment and/or could have a material adverse effect on us. we cannot assure you that litigation related to our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others can always be avoided or successfully concluded.
even if we were to prevail, any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on us.
our business is subject to potential tax liabilities.
the company is subject to income tax, indirect tax or other tax claims by tax agencies in jurisdictions in which it conducts business. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. the united states federal government enacted significant tax reform, and certain provisions of the new law may adversely affect us. the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (the tax reform act) has resulted in significant changes to the united states corporate income tax system. these changes include a federal statutory rate reduction from 35% to 21%, the elimination or reduction of certain domestic deductions and credits and limitations on the deductibility of interest expense. the tax reform act also transitions international taxation from a worldwide system to a modified territorial system and includes base erosion prevention measures on non-u.s. earnings, which has the effect of subjecting certain earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to united states taxation. these changes became effective in 2018.
in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate income tax, indirect tax, or other tax determination is uncertain. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, we cannot assure that the final
27
determination of any tax audits and litigation will not be materially different from that which is reflected in historical tax provisions and accruals. should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit, assessment or litigation, there could be a material adverse effect on our cash, tax provisions and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
we are subject to environmental laws, conflict minerals-related provisions of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act as well as a variety of other laws or regulations that could result in additional costs and liabilities.
our operations and properties have in the past been and continue to be subject to various united states and foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to materials used in our products and manufacturing processes, discharge of pollutants into the environment, the treatment, transport, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and remediation of contamination. these laws and regulations require our suppliers to obtain permits for operations making our products, including the discharge of air pollutants and wastewater. although our management systems are designed to oversee our suppliers' compliance, we cannot assure you that our suppliers have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws, regulations and permits. if our suppliers violate or fail to comply with any of them, a range of consequences could result, including fines, suspension of production, alteration of manufacturing processes, import/export restrictions, sales limitations, criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. such non-compliance from our manufacturing suppliers could result in disruptions in supply, higher sourcing costs, and/or reputational damage for us.
environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. for example, the european union (eu) and china are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted restrictions on the use of lead and other materials in electronic products. these regulations affect semiconductor devices and packaging. as regulations restricting materials in electronic products continue to increase around the world, there is a risk that the cost, quality and manufacturing yields of products that are subject to these restrictions may be less favorable compared to products that are not subject to such restrictions, or that the transition to compliant products may not meet customer roadmaps, or produce sudden changes in demand, which may result in excess inventory. a number of jurisdictions including the eu, australia, california and china are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulations for computers and servers based on energy star specifications as well as additional energy consumption limits. there is the potential for certain of our products being excluded from some of these markets which could materially adversely affect us.
certain environmental laws, including the united states comprehensive, environmental response, compensation and liability act of 1980, or the superfund act, impose strict or, under certain circumstances, joint and several liability on current and previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances and impose liability for damages to natural resources. these laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of, or was not responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances. these environmental laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated. such persons can be responsible for cleanup costs even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility. we have been named as a responsible party at three superfund sites in sunnyvale, california. although we have not yet been, we could be named a potentially responsible party at other superfund or contaminated sites in the future. in addition, contamination that has not yet been identified could exist at our other facilities.
under the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010, the sec adopted disclosure and reporting requirements for companies that use "conflict" minerals originating from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries. we continue to incur additional costs associated with complying with these requirements, such as costs related to developing internal controls for the due diligence process, determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products, auditing the process and reporting to our customers and the sec. in addition to the sec regulation, the european union, china and other jurisdictions are developing new policies focused on conflict minerals that may impact and increase the cost of our compliance program. also, since our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the subject minerals. moreover, we are likely to encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified as "conflict free." if we cannot satisfy these customers, they may choose a competitor's products.
the united states federal government has issued new policies for federal procurement focused on eradicating the practice of forced labor and human trafficking. in addition, the united kingdom, australia and the state of california have issued laws that require us to disclose our policy and practices for identifying and eliminating forced labor and human trafficking in our supply chain. several customers as well as the responsible business alliance have also issued expectations to eliminate these practices that may impact us. while we have a policy and management systems to identify and avoid these practices in our supply chain, we cannot guarantee that our suppliers will always be in conformance to these laws and expectations. we may face enforcement liability and reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently meet these expectations. moreover, we are likely to encounter challenges with customers if we cannot satisfy their forced and trafficked labor polices and they may choose a competitor's product.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements as of december 29, 2018 and december 30, 2017 and for each of the three years in the period ended december 29, 2018 and related notes, which are included in this annual report on form 10-k as well as with the other sections of this annual report on form 10-k, including "part i, item 1: business," "part ii, item 6: selected financial data" and "part ii, item 8: financial statements and supplementary data."
introduction we are a global semiconductor company primarily offering:
•   x86 microprocessors, as standalone devices or as incorporated into an accelerated processing unit (apu), chipsets, discrete and integrated graphics processing units (gpus), and professional gpus; and
•   server and embedded processors, semi-custom system-on-chip (soc) products and technology for game consoles.
we also license portions of our intellectual property (ip) portfolio.
in this management's discussion and analysis (md&a), we will describe the results of operations and the financial condition for us and our consolidated subsidiaries, including a discussion of our results of operations for 2018 compared to 2017 and 2017 compared to 2016, an analysis of changes in our financial condition and a discussion of our contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements.
overview our 2018 financial results demonstrate the success of our strong product roadmap execution. customers continued to adopt our high performance products as new products accounted for over 65% of our annual 2018 revenue. net revenue for 2018 was $6.5 billion, an increase of 23% compared to 2017 net revenue of $5.3 billion. gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2018, was 38%, a 4% increase compared to 34% in 2017. our operating income for 2018 improved to $451 million compared to operating income of $127 million for 2017. our net income for 2018 improved to $337 million compared to a net loss of $33 million in the prior year.
we significantly expanded our desktop processor offerings in 2018 with the launch of our second-generation amd ryzen and high-end amd ryzen threadrippertm wx processors for gamers, creators and hardware enthusiasts. we announced the availability of our first desktop consumer and commercial ryzen and ryzen pro apus that combine our high-performance "zen" cpu and radeon "vega" graphics cores into a single chip. we also introduced the first entry-level processors based on our "zen" cpu and "vega" gpu cores for the consumer and commercial desktop pc market with the amd athlontm and amd pro processors. in the notebook market, multiple customers launched premium consumer and commercial pcs featuring our mobile amd ryzen apus, including our first enterprise-class notebooks powered by our new amd ryzen pro apus. for the high-performance embedded markets, we introduced the amd epyctm embedded 3000 processor and amd ryzen embedded v1000 processor families that bring new levels of computing and graphics performance to the thin client, digital signage, and infrastructure markets.
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december 29, 2018 were $1.16 billion, down from $1.18 billion at the end of 2017. principal amount of total debt as of december 29, 2018 was $1.53 billion, compared to $1.70 billion as of december 30, 2017.
we intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements.
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap). the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. we evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to our revenue, inventories, goodwill impairments and income taxes. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with
36
management's expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions.
management believes the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.
revenue recognition. in accordance with the adoption of the new revenue standard effective the beginning of the first quarter of 2018, we now recognize revenue upon the shipment of the product to our distributors (sell-in), rather than upon the resale of the product by our distributors to their customers (sell-through). accordingly, we have established provisions for rights of return and price protection on unsold product held by our distributors.
revenue allowances. we record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales for estimated future price reductions and other customer incentives in the same period that the related revenues are recorded. we base these estimates on actual historical sales returns, historical allowances, historical price reductions, market activity and other known or anticipated trends and factors. these estimates are subject to management's judgment and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and operating results.
inventory valuation. at each balance sheet date, we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence based on projected sales outlook. this evaluation includes analysis of historical sales levels by product and projections of future demand. these projections assist us in determining the carrying value of our inventory. in addition, we write off inventories that we consider obsolete. we adjust the remaining specific inventory balances to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or net realizable value. among other factors, management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence and realizable value. if in any period we anticipate future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. this would have a negative impact on our gross margin in that period. if in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written down in a previous period, related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sales resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period.
goodwill. we perform our goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. the analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment.
qualitative factors include industry and market consideration, overall financial performance, share price trends and market capitalization and company-specific events. we first analyze qualitative factors. if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we do not proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test.
a quantitative impairment analysis, if necessary, considers the income approach, which requires estimates of the present value of expected future cash flows to determine a reporting unit's fair value. significant estimates include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, discount rates, and future economic and market conditions. if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value.
a goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value. any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
income taxes. in determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. these estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes.
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. if recovery is not likely, we must increase our charge to income tax expense in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. we consider past performance, future expected taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance.
in addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the internal revenue service or other taxing authorities. if our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results, an additional tax benefit or charge will result. we recognize the interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and income tax expense, respectively.

in december 2017, the u.s. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 (tax reform act). the legislation significantly changes u.s. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, implementing a modified territorial tax system and imposing a transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. the tax reform act permanently reduces the u.s. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate, effective january 1, 2018. the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no. 118 (sab 118) to address the application of u.s. gaap in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the tax reform act. more specifically, sab 118 allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period that is similar to the measurement period used when accounting for business combinations. as a result, we have recognized the provisional tax impacts related to deemed repatriated earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 30, 2017. during 2018, we finalized our computation of the impact of the tax reform act.
in january 2018, the fasb released guidance on the accounting for tax on the global intangible low-taxed income (gilti) provisions of the tax reform act. the gilti provisions impose a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. the guidance allows companies to make an accounting policy election to either (i) account for gilti as a component of tax expense in the period in which they are subject to the rules (the period cost method), or (ii) account for gilti in the company's measurement of deferred taxes (the deferred method). after completing the analysis of the gilti provisions, we elected to account for gilti using the period cost method.
results of operations we report our financial performance based on the following two reportable segments:the computing and graphics segment and the enterprise, embedded and semi-custom segment.
additional information on our reportable segments is contained in note 15: segment reporting of the notes to financial statements (part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k).
our operating results tend to vary seasonally. historically, first quarter pc product sales were generally lower than fourth quarter sales and with respect to our semi-custom soc products for game consoles our sales pattern usually reflects higher sales in the second and third quarters compared to the first and fourth quarters.
the following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment for 2018, 2017 and 2016.

computing and graphics computing and graphics net revenue of $4.1 billion in 2018 increased by 39%, compared to $3.0 billion in 2017, primarily as a result of a 15% increase in average selling price and a 17% increase in unit shipments. the increase in average selling price and unit shipments was primarily driven by higher demand for our ryzentm processors.
computing and graphics net revenue of $3.0 billion in 2017 increased by 50%, compared to $2.0 billion in 2016 as a result of a 38% increase in average selling price and a 1% increase in unit shipments. the increase in the average selling price was primarily driven by ryzen desktop processor and radeon graphics products sales. the increase in unit shipments was primarily attributable to higher demand for our radeon graphics products.
computing and graphics operating income was $470 million in 2018 compared to operating income of $92 million in 2017. the improvement in operating income was primarily driven by higher demand for ryzen and radeon products as customers continued to adopt our new products, partially offset by a $195 million increase in operating expenses. operating expenses increased for the reasons set forth under "expenses" below.
38
computing and graphics operating income was $92 million in 2017, compared to an operating loss of $243 million in 2016. the improvement in operating results was primarily due to the increase in net revenue referenced above, partially offset by the related increase in cost of sales and operating expenses. operating expenses increased for the reasons set forth under "expenses" below.
enterprise, embedded and semi-custom enterprise, embedded and semi-custom net revenue of $2.4 billion in 2018 increased by 3% compared to net revenue of $2.3 billion 2017. the increase in net revenue was primarily due to higher sales of our epyctm server products, partially offset by lower semi-custom revenue.
enterprise, embedded and semi-custom net revenue of $2.28 billion in 2017 decreased by 2% compared to net revenue of $2.33 billion in 2016. ip related revenue and sales of our epyc datacenter processors, which were launched in june of 2017, were mostly offset by a decrease in non-recurring engineering (nre) revenue and lower sales of our semi-custom soc products.
enterprise, embedded and semi-custom operating income was $163 million in 2018 compared to operating income of $132 million in 2017. the improvement in operating income was due primarily to richer server and semi-custom product mix, partially offset by a $50 million increase in operating expenses and lower ip-related revenue. in 2017, operating income also included a licensing gain of $52 million. operating expenses increased for the reasons set forth under "expenses" below.
enterprise, embedded and semi-custom operating income was $132 million in 2017 compared to operating income of $287 million in 2016. the decline in operating results was primarily due to an increase in operating expenses driven primarily by datacenter-related expenses and lower licensing gain recorded in 2017 related to the licensed ip to the thatic jv compared to 2016. operating expenses increased for the reasons set forth under "expenses" below.
all other all other operating loss of $182 million in 2018 included stock-based compensation expense of $137 million and an impairment of technology licenses of $45 million.
all other operating loss of $97 million in 2017 was related to stock-based compensation expense.
all other operating loss of $417 million in 2016 included a charge of $340 million, which was comprised of the $100 million payment under the sixth amendment and the $240 million value of the warrant under the warrant agreement with wch, and stock-based compensation expense of $86 million, partially offset by restructuring reversals of $10 million.

gross margin gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 38% in 2018 compared to 34% in 2017. the improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by the ramp of new products with higher gross margin than the corporate average.
39
gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 34% in 2017 compared to 23% in 2016. gross margin improved in 2017 primarily due to the absence of the charge of $340 million recorded in 2016, comprised of a $100 million payment under the sixth amendment and the value of the warrant of $240 million under the warrant agreement, which accounted for eight gross margin percentage points. in addition, the increase in gross margin percentage for 2017 compared to 2016 was due to a favorable shift in product mix to new radeon gpu and ryzen desktop processor products in the computing and graphics segment.
expenses research and development expenses research and development expenses of $1.4 billion in 2018 increased by $238 million, or 20%, compared to $1.2 billion in 2017. the increase was primarily driven by a $168 million increase in product engineering and design related costs attributable to both segments, and higher annual employee incentives driven by improved financial performance.
research and development expenses of $1.2 billion in 2017 increased by $188 million, or 19%, compared to $1.0 billion in 2016. the increase was primarily due to a $136 million increase in product engineering and design related costs attributable to both segments, and higher annual employee incentives driven by improved financial performance.
marketing, general and administrative expenses marketing, general and administrative expenses of $562 million in 2018 increased by $46 million, or 9%, compared to $516 million in 2017. the increase was primarily due to a $41 million increase in sales and marketing activities attributable to both segments and higher annual employee incentives driven by our improved financial performance.
marketing, general and administrative expenses of $516 million in 2017 increased by $50 million, or 11%, compared to $466 million in 2016. the increase was primarily due to a $29 million increase in sales and marketing activities attributable to both segments and higher annual employee incentives driven by our improved financial performance.
interest expense interest expense of $121 million in 2018 decreased by $5 million compared to $126 million in 2017, primarily due to lower debt balances and lower weighted average interest rates.
interest expense of $126 million in 2017 decreased by $30 million compared to $156 million in 2016, primarily due to lower weighted average interest rates and lower debt balances.
other income (expense), net other income (expense), net of zero in 2018 changed by $9 million compared to $9 million other expense, net in 2017. the change from 2017 to 2018 was primarily due to $12 million higher interest income in 2018 mainly related to a withholding tax refund from a foreign jurisdiction.
other expense, net of $9 million in 2017 changed by $89 million compared to $80 million other income, net in 2016. the change from 2016 to 2017 was primarily due to the absence in 2017 of the substantial gain on sale of equity interests in atmp jv that was partially offset by loss on debt redemption in 2016.
provision (benefit) for income taxes we recorded an income tax benefit of $9 million in 2018 and an income tax provision of $18 million and $39 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
the income tax benefit in 2018 was primarily due to a $36 million refund of withholding tax from a foreign jurisdiction related to a legal settlement from 2010, offset by $13 million of u.s. income taxes resulting from the tax reform act, $7 million tax provision in foreign locations and $7 million of withholding taxes on cross-border transactions.
the income tax provision in 2017 was primarily due to withholding taxes applicable to ip-related revenue and licensing gains from foreign locations.
the income tax provision in 2016 was primarily due to $41 million of foreign taxes in profitable locations including $27 million attributable to a gain on the sale of 85% of the ownership interest in the subsidiary operating a factory in suzhou and $9 million of withholding taxes on cross-border transactions where no foreign tax credit is expected to be realizable, offset by $2 million of tax benefits for canadian tax credits and the monetization of certain u.s. tax credits.

international sales international sales as a percentage of net revenue were 80% in 2018 and 74% in 2017. the increase in international sales as a percentage of net revenue in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily driven by a higher proportion of revenue from china and taiwan related to sales of our products within the computing and graphics segment.
international sales as a percentage of net revenue were 74% in 2017 and 79% in 2016. the decrease in international sales as a percentage of net revenue in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by a higher proportion of revenue from domestic sales of our desktop processors, graphics processors and semi-custom soc products.
we expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. substantially all of our sales transactions were denominated in u.s. dollars.
financial condition liquidity and capital resources as of december 29, 2018, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $1.16 billion compared to $1.18 billion as of december 30, 2017. the percentage of cash and cash equivalents held domestically was 88% as of december 29, 2018, and 95% as of december 30, 2017. our operating, investing and financing activities for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:

net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash     $(108   )          $(75   )          $480
our aggregate principal debt obligations were $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion as of december 29, 2018 and december 30, 2017, respectively.
we believe our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance along with our secured revolving line of credit will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures, over the next 12 months. we believe we will be able to access the capital markets should we require additional funds. however, we cannot assure that such funds will be available on favorable terms, or at all.
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was $34 million in 2018 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $12 million in 2017. the increase in net cash provided in operating activities was primarily due to changes in working capital, largely driven by higher cash collections from increased revenue, partially offset by higher labor costs and timing of accounts payable payments.
net cash provided by operating activities was $12 million in 2017 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $81 million in 2016. the decrease in cash inflows from operating activities was primarily due to higher operating costs including higher wafer purchases and higher labor costs, partially offset by higher cash collection primarily due to higher revenue and lower interest payments resulting from debt reductions.
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was $170 million in 2018, which primarily consisted of $163 million for purchases of property and equipment, a net cash outflow from purchases and maturities of available-for-sale debt securities partially offset by collection of deferred proceeds on sale of receivables.
net cash used in investing activities was $54 million in 2017, which consisted primarily of a cash outflow of $113 million for purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by collection of deferred proceeds on sale of receivables.
net cash provided by investing activities was $277 million in 2016, which primarily consisted of a net cash inflow of $342 million from sale of equity interests in the atmp jv, partially offset by purchases of property and equipment .

financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was $28 million in 2018, which consisted of a net cash inflow of $69 million from the issuance of common stock through employee equity incentive plans, partially offset by the repurchase of an aggregate principal amount of $40 million of our outstanding 6.75% senior notes due 2019 (6.75% notes) and 7.00% senior notes due 2024 (7.00% notes) for $41 million in cash.
net cash used in financing activities was $33 million in 2017, which primarily consisted of the repurchases of an aggregate principal amount of $103 million of our outstanding 6.75% notes and 7.00% notes for $110 million in cash and $13 million for tax withholding on the vesting of restricted stock, partially offset by the $70 million net proceeds from our secured revolving line of credit and the $20 million proceeds from issuance of common stock under stock-based compensation equity plans.
net cash provided by financing activities was $122 million in 2016, which primarily consisted of the $782 million net proceeds from the issuance of our 2.125% convertible senior notes due 2026 (2.125% notes), the $667 million net proceeds from selling 115 million shares of our common stock and the $20 million proceeds from issuance of common stock under stock-based compensation equity plans, partially offset by the repurchases of an aggregate principal amount of $1.1 billion of our outstanding 6.75% notes, 7.75% senior notes due 2020 (7.75% notes), 7.50% senior notes due 2022 (7.50% notes) and 7.00% notes for $1.1 billion in cash and repayments in aggregate of $230 million of our secured revolving line of credit.

holders may convert their notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding june 1, 2026 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on september 30, 2016 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any 10 consecutive trading day period (the "measurement period") in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. on or after june 1, 2026 and until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election.

the conversion rate is initially 125.0031 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $8.00 per share of common stock). the conversion rate is subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. in addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date, we will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its notes in connection with such a corporate event in certain circumstances.
if we undergo a fundamental change prior to the maturity date of the notes, holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.
as of december 29, 2018, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 2.125% notes was $805 million. see note 13 of "notes to consolidated financial statements" below for additional information regarding our 2.125% notes.

secured revolving line of credit on april 14, 2015, we and our subsidiary, amd international sales & service, ltd. (together, the borrowers), ati technologies ulc (collectively with the borrowers, the loan parties), a group of lenders and bank of america n.a., acting as the agent for the lenders, entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement, as amended (the agreement). the agreement provides for a secured revolving line of credit (the secured revolving line of credit) that allows the borrowers to borrow, repay and re-borrow amounts from time to time up to $500 million with up to $45 million available for issuance of letters of credit, subject to certain conditions. borrowings are limited up to a certain amount of eligible accounts receivable, as determined in accordance with the agreement. the size of the commitment under the secured revolving line of credit may be increased by up to an aggregate amount of $200 million. the commitments under the secured revolving line of credit are available through

march 21, 2022. the borrowers are subject to commitment fees and letter of credit facility fees. the loan parties are required to comply with certain covenants under the agreement.
the secured revolving line of credit bears interest, at the option of the borrowers, either at (a) a customary london interbank offered rate (libor) plus an applicable margin (as determined in accordance with the agreement), or (b) (i) the greatest of (x) the bank's prime rate, (y) the federal funds rate as published by the federal reserve bank of new york plus 0.50%, and (z) libor for a one-month period plus 1.00%, plus (ii) an applicable margin.

the agreements governing our 6.75% notes, 7.50% notes, 7.00% notes, 2.125% notes and our secured revolving line of credit contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross defaults under agreements covering other borrowings. the occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable note holders or the lenders under the secured revolving line of credit to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable.

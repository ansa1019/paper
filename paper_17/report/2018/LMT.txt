international business a key component of our strategic plan is to grow our international sales. to accomplish this growth, we continue to focus on strengthening our relationships internationally through partnerships and joint technology efforts. we conduct business with international customers through each of our business segments through either fms or direct sales to international customers.
international customers accounted for 36% of aeronautics' 2018 net sales. there continues to be strong international interest in the f-35 program, which includes commitments from the u.s. government and eight international partner countries and four international customers, as well as expressions of interest from other countries. the u.s. government and the eight partner countries continue to work together on the design, testing, production, and sustainment of the f-35 program. the international commitment to the program continues to grow. during 2018, the government of belgium announced its decision to purchase 34 f-35 aircraft. additionally in 2018, we finalized the low rate initial production (lrip) 11 contract with the dod at $11.5 billion of funding for the production of 141 f-35 aircraft. this award includes international f-35 partners and fms customers. other areas of international expansion at our aeronautics business segment include the f-16 program. during 2018, we received a $1.1 billion contract from the u.s. government to produce 16 new production f-16 block 70 aircraft for the royal bahraini air force. the undefinitized contract action (uca) award represents the first f-16 block 70 sale and the first f-16 production program to be performed in greenville, south carolina. additionally, in december 2018, slovakia signed a letter of offer and acceptance (loa) to procure 14 new production f-16 block 70/72 aircraft and we were awarded a contract to upgrade 84 f-16 aircraft for the greek ministry of defence.
in 2018, international customers accounted for 26% of mfc's net sales. our mfc business segment continues to generate significant international interest, most notably in the air and missile defense product line, which produces the patriot advanced capability-3 (pac-3) and terminal high altitude area defense (thaad) systems. the pac-3 is an advanced missile defense system designed to intercept incoming airborne threats. we have ongoing pac-3 programs for production and sustainment activities in the kingdom of saudi arabia, uae, qatar, the republic of korea, japan and taiwan. additionally during 2018, the u.s. and swedish officials formalized an agreement to provide pac-3 missiles to sweden. thaad is an integrated system designed to protect against high altitude ballistic missile threats. uae is an international customer for thaad, and other countries in the middle east, europe and the asia-pacific region have also expressed interest in our air and missile defense systems, including the kingdom of saudi arabia. additionally, we continue to see international demand for our tactical missile and fire control products, where we received orders for hellfire missile systems from the netherlands and japan, precision fires systems from romania, as well as interest from poland, where we will be submitting a proposal for a multiple launch rocket system (mlrs). other mfc international customers include the united kingdom, germany, india, kuwait, and bahrain.
in 2018, international customers accounted for 26% of rms' net sales. our rms business segment continues to experience international interest in the aegis ballistic missile defense system. we perform activities in the development, production, modernization, ship integration, test and lifetime support for ships of international customers such as japan, spain, republic of korea, and australia. we have ongoing programs in canada and chile for combat systems equipment upgrades on halifax-class and type 23 frigates. in our training and logistics solutions portfolio, we have active programs and pursuits in the united kingdom, the kingdom of saudi arabia, canada, egypt, singapore, and australia. in addition, sikorsky adds a significant international component to the rms business segment with an installed base of over 1,000 aircraft internationally. we have active development, production, and sustainment support of the s-70i black hawk® and mh-60 seahawk® aircraft to foreign military customers, including chile, australia, denmark, taiwan, the kingdom of saudi arabia and colombia. commercial aircraft are sold to customers in the oil and gas industry, emergency medical evacuation, search and rescue fleets, and vip customers in over 30 countries.
international customers accounted for 16% of space's 2018 net sales. our space business segment includes the operations of awe, which operates the united kingdom's nuclear deterrent program. the work at awe covers the entire life cycle, from initial concept, assessment and design, through component manufacture and assembly, in-service support and decommissioning and disposal. in addition, space has international contracts with the kingdom of saudi arabia and japan to design and manufacture geostationary communication satellites using the a2100 satellite platform.

status of the f-35 program the f-35 program primarily consists of production contracts, sustainment activities, and new development efforts. production of the aircraft is expected to continue for many years given the u.s. government's current inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft for the u.s. air force, u.s. marine corps, and u.s. navy; commitments from our eight international partners and three international customers; as well as expressions of interest from other countries.
during 2018, the f-35 program completed several milestones both domestically and internationally. the u.s. government continued testing the aircraft, including ship trials, mission and weapons systems evaluations, and the f-35 fleet recently surpassed 175,000 flight hours. in april 2018, we completed the system development and demonstration (sdd) flight testing portion of the development contract and began the next phase of development in support of phased capability improvements and modernization of the f-35 air system. this next phase of development work is being performed separately from the basic sdd contract as part of the joint program office's continuous capability development and delivery (c2d2) strategy. on june 11, we delivered the 300th production f-35 aircraft, demonstrating the f-35 program's continued progress and longevity. the first 300 f-35 aircraft delivered to u.s. and international customers include 197 f-35a variants, 75 f-35b variants, and 28 f-35c variants. in december 2018, the dod officially approved the f-35 program to begin the formal initial operational test & evaluation (iot&e) phase. testing is expected to be completed during 2019. the data will be analyzed by the u.s. government as part of their evaluation to transition the f-35 program from lrip into full-rate production at the end of 2019.
several milestones were also achieved with our u.s. government and international customers. first, united kingdom's f-35b carried out the first trials with uk-built weapons. this represents a key part of the work-up toward initial operating capability efforts. second, f-35cs' participated in integrated flight operations aboard the uss abraham lincoln. third, a u.s. marine corps f-35b conducted the first combat strike in the u.s. central command area of responsibility in support of operation freedom's sentinel in afghanistan on september 27. fourth, the royal navy landed the f-35b on the hms queen elizabeth.
on september 28, we finalized the lrip 11 contract with the dod at $11.5 billion for the production and delivery of 141 f-35 aircraft at the lowest per aircraft price in program history. in november 2018, the u.s. government awarded an aggregate $22.7 billion uca block buy for the production of 252 f-35 aircraft in order to provide greater production efficiency, stability and cost savings. as of december 31, 2018, we have delivered 357 production aircraft to our u.s. and international partners, and we have 396 production aircraft in backlog, including orders from our international partners.
given the size and complexity of the f-35 program, we anticipate that there will be continual reviews related to aircraft performance, program schedule, cost, and requirements as part of the dod, congressional, and international partners' oversight and budgeting processes. current program challenges include, but are not limited to, supplier and partner performance, software development, level of cost associated with life cycle operations and sustainment and warranties, receiving funding for production contracts on a timely basis, executing future flight tests, findings resulting from testing and operating the aircraft.

(a)   for the year ended december 31, 2018, operating profit includes a non-cash asset impairment charge of $110 million related to our equity method investee, advanced military maintenance, repair and overhaul center llc (ammroc). for the year ended december 31, 2017, operating profit includes a $64 million charge, which represents our portion of a non-cash asset impairment charge recorded by ammroc (see "note 1 - significant accounting policies" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements for more information). for the year ended december 31, 2017, operating profit includes a previously deferred non-cash gain of approximately $198 million related to properties sold in 2015 (see "note 8 - property, plant and equipment, net" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements for more information). for the year ended december 31, 2016, operating profit includes a non-cash gain on the step acquisition of awe of approximately $104 million (see "note 3 - acquisition and divestitures" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements for more information).
(b)   in 2017, we recorded a net one-time tax charge of $2.0 billion ($6.77 per share), substantially all of which was non-cash, primarily related to the estimated impact of the tax cuts and jobs act. see "income tax expense" section below and "note 9 - income taxes" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
certain amounts reported in other income, net, primarily our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees, are included in the operating profit of our business segments. accordingly, such amounts are included in our discussion of our business segment results of operations.

net sales we generate sales from the delivery of products and services to our customers. our consolidated net sales were as follows (in millions):
2018                2017                2016
products                     $45,005             $42,502             $40,081

substantially all of our contracts are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method. under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method, we record net sales on contracts over time based upon our progress towards completion on a particular contract, as well as our estimate of the profit to be earned at completion. the following discussion of material changes in our consolidated net sales should be read in tandem with the subsequent discussion of changes in our consolidated cost of sales and our business segment results of operations because changes in our sales are typically accompanied by a corresponding change in our cost of sales due to the nature of the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method.
product sales product sales increased $2.5 billion, or 6%, in 2018 as compared to 2017. the increase was primarily due to higher product sales of about $1.2 billion at aeronautics, $1.0 billion at mfc and $315 million at rms. higher product sales at aeronautics was primarily due to higher production volume for the f-35 program and higher volume on modernization contracts for the f-16 program. the increase at mfc was primarily due to increased volume for tactical and strike missiles programs (primarily classified programs and precision fires). the increase at rms was primarily due to increased production volume for integrated warfare systems and sensors (iwss) programs (primarily radar surveillance systems).
product sales increased $2.4 billion, or 6%, in 2017 as compared to 2016. the increase was primarily due to higher product sales of about $1.9 billion at aeronautics and $340 million at mfc. the increase in product sales at aeronautics was primarily attributable to higher sales for the f-35 program due to increased production volume and higher sales for the c-130 program due to increased production volume and aircraft configuration mix, partially offset by a decrease in sales for the c-5 program due to lower production volume. higher product sales at mfc was primarily due to an increase in sales for air and missile defense programs due to higher volume (primarily terminal high altitude area defense (thaad)), higher sales for tactical and strike missile programs due to product configuration mix (primarily precision fires) and increased volume (primarily classified programs), and higher sales for sensor and global sustainment programs due to increased volume (primarily low altitude navigation and targeting infrared for night (lantirn®) and sniper®).
service sales service sales increased $1.3 billion, or 17%, in 2018 as compared to 2017, primarily due to an increase in service sales of about $605 million at aeronautics, $270 million at rms, and $245 million at space. the increase in service sales at aeronautics was primarily due to higher sustainment volume for the f-35 and f-22 programs. higher service sales at rms was primarily due to increased volume for c6isr (command, control, communications, computers, cyber, combat systems, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance) and iwss programs. the increase in service sales at space was primarily due to increased volume on government satellite services.
service sales increased $249 million, or 3%, in 2017 as compared to 2016, primarily due to an increase in service sales of about $200 million at aeronautics, $155 million at mfc and $70 million at rms. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in service sales of about $180 million at space. the increase in service sales at aeronautics was primarily due to increased volume on sustainment activities (primarily the f-35 and c-130 programs). higher service sales at mfc was primarily attributable to increased volume on sustainment activities (primarily patriot advanced capability-3 (pac-3) and special operations forces contractor logistics support services (sof clss)). higher service sales at rms was primarily due to increased volume on sustainment activities at sikorsky. the decrease in service sales at space was primarily due to lower launch related volume for space transportation programs, partially offset by increased volume for government satellite services.

cost of sales cost of sales, for both products and services, consist of materials, labor, subcontracting costs, an allocation of indirect costs (overhead and general and administrative), as well as the costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers. for each of our contracts, we monitor the nature and amount of costs at the contract level, which form the basis for estimating our total costs to complete the contract. our consolidated cost of sales were as follows (in millions):
2018                      2017                      2016

the following discussion of material changes in our consolidated cost of sales for products and services should be read in tandem with the preceding discussion of changes in our consolidated net sales and our business segment results of operations. we have not identified any developing trends in cost of sales for products and services that would have a material impact on our future operations.
product costs product costs increased approximately $1.9 billion, or 5%, in 2018 as compared to 2017. the increase was primarily due to increased product costs of about $1.2 billion at aeronautics and $820 million at mfc. higher product costs at aeronautics was primarily due to higher production volume for the f-35 program and higher volume on modernization contracts for the f-16 program. the increase in product costs at mfc was primarily due to increased volume for tactical and strike missiles programs (primarily classified programs and precision fires).
product costs increased approximately $2.0 billion, or 6%, in 2017 as compared to 2016. the increase was primarily due to increased product costs of about $1.5 billion at aeronautics and $315 million at mfc. the increase in product costs at aeronautics was primarily due to increased volume on aircraft production for the f-35 program and higher cost for the c-130 program due to increased production volume and aircraft configuration mix, partially offset by a decrease in cost for the c-5 program due to lower production volume. higher product costs at mfc was primarily attributable to an increase in cost for tactical and strike missile programs due to product configuration mix (primarily precision fires) and increased volume (classified programs) and higher product costs for air and missile defense programs due to contract mix (primarily pac-3) and higher volume (primarily thaad).
service costs service costs increased approximately $1.1 billion, or 16%, in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to increased service costs of about $535 million at aeronautics, $215 million at rms, and $170 million at space. the increase in service costs at aeronautics was primarily due to higher sustainment volume for the f-35 and f-22 programs. higher service costs at rms were primarily due to increased volume for various c6isr and iwss programs. the increase in service costs at space was primarily due to increased volume on government satellite services.
service costs increased approximately $250 million, or 4%, in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to increased service costs of about $230 million at aeronautics and $150 million at mfc. these increases were partially offset by a decrease of about$135 million at space. higher service costs at aeronautics was primarily due to increased volume on sustainment activities (primarily the f-35 and c-130 programs). higher service costs at mfc was primarily attributable to higher volume on sustainment activities (primarily pac-3 and sof clss). the decrease in service costs at space was primarily due to lower launch related volume for space transportation programs, partially offset by increased volume for government satellite services.

restructuring charges
2018 actions during 2018, we recorded charges totaling $96 million ($76 million, or $0.26 per share, after tax) related to certain severance and restructuring actions at our rms business segment. these charges consist of $75 million of severance costs for the planned elimination of certain positions through either voluntary or involuntary actions and $21 million of asset impairment charges associated with our decision to consolidate certain operations. upon separation, terminated employees will receive lump-sum severance payments primarily based on years of service, a majority of which we expect to pay by the end of 2019. these actions resulted from a strategic review of our rms business segment and are intended to improve the efficiency of our operations and better align our organization and cost structure with changing economic conditions. we expect to recover a portion of the severance and restructuring charges through the pricing of our products and services to the u.s. government and other customers in future periods, which will be included in rms' operating results. during 2018, we paid approximately $33 million in severance payments associated with these actions.
2016 actions during 2016, we recorded severance charges totaling approximately $80 million related to our aeronautics business segment. the charges consisted of severance costs associated with the planned elimination of certain positions through either voluntary or involuntary actions. upon separation, terminated employees receive lump-sum severance payments primarily based on years of service, the majority of which are expected to be paid over the next several quarters. as of the end of the first quarter of 2017, we had substantially paid the severance costs associated with these actions.
other unallocated, net other unallocated, net primarily includes the fas/cas operating adjustment as described in the "business segment results of operations" section below, stock-based compensation and other corporate costs. these items are not allocated to the business segments and, therefore, are excluded from the cost of sales for products and services. other unallocated, net was a net reduction to expense of $1.6 billion in 2018, $1.5 billion in 2017 and $1.0 billion in 2016.
the increase in net reduction in expense from 2018 to 2017 and 2017 to 2016 was primarily attributable to fluctuations in the fas/cas operating adjustment of $1.8 billion in 2018, $1.6 billion in 2017 and $1.3 billion in 2016, partially offset by fluctuations in other costs associated with various corporate items, none of which were individually significant. the increase in the fas/cas operating adjustment over the periods was primarily attributable to an increase in u.s. government cost accounting standards (cas) pension cost due to the impact of phasing in cas harmonization. see "critical accounting policies - postretirement benefit plans" discussion below for more information on our cas pension cost. additionally, the increase in net reduction to expense in 2017 as compared to 2016 was driven by corporate overhead costs reclassified during 2016 from our former is&gs business to other unallocated, net. see "note 3 - acquisition and divestitures" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about costs reclassified to other unallocated, net.
other income, net other income, net primarily includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees and gains or losses for acquisitions and divestitures. other income, net in 2018 was $60 million, compared to $373 million in 2017 and $487 million in 2016. the decrease in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily attributable to the recognition in 2018 of a non-cash asset impairment charge of $110 million ($83 million, or $0.29 per share, after tax) related to our equity method investee, ammroc, decreased earnings generated by equity method investees, and the recognition in 2017 of a previously deferred non-cash gain of approximately $198 million related to properties sold in 2015. the decrease in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to decreased earnings generated by equity method investees and recognition in 2017 of our portion of a non-cash asset impairment charge recorded by our equity method investee, ammroc. these decreases were partially offset by the recognition in 2017 of a previously deferred non-cash gain of approximately $198 million related to properties sold in 2015, which was greater than the net gain of $104 million recognized in the third quarter of 2016 on the step acquisition of awe.
32
interest expense interest expense in 2018 was $668 million, compared to $651 million in 2017 and $663 million in 2016. the slight increase in interest expense in 2018 resulted primarily from increased interest expense on interest rate swaps and commercial paper, partially offset by our scheduled repayment of $750 million of debt during 2018. the decrease in interest expense in 2017 resulted primarily from our scheduled repayment of $952 million of debt during 2016. see "capital structure, resources and other" included within "liquidity and cash flows" discussion below and "note 10 - debt" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our debt.
other non-operating expense, net other non-operating expense, net primarily includes the non-service cost components of fas pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense (i.e., interest cost, expected return on plan assets, net actuarial gains or losses, and amortization of prior service cost or credits) related to our postretirement benefit plans. other non-operating expense, net in 2018 decreased slightly compared to 2017 primarily due to fluctuations in other costs associated with various items, none of which were individually significant. other non-operating expense, net increased $376 million from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to higher non-service cost components of fas expense related to a lower discount rate and lower expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
income tax expense our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 13.6% for 2018, 64.0% for 2017, and 23.0% for 2016. on december 22, 2017, the president signed the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act"). the tax act, among other things, lowered the u.s. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018. consequently, we wrote down our net deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2017 by $2.0 billion to reflect the estimated impact of the tax act. we recorded a corresponding net one-time charge of $2.0 billion ($6.77 per share), substantially all of which was non-cash, primarily related to enactment of the tax act, the re-measurement of certain net deferred tax assets using the lower u.s. corporate income tax rate (approximately $1.9 billion), a deemed repatriation tax (approximately $43 million), and a reduction in the u.s. manufacturing benefit (approximately $81 million) as a result of our decision to accelerate contributions to our pension fund in 2018 in order to receive a tax deduction in 2017. the net one-time charge related to the tax act increased our 2017 effective income tax rate by 37.5 percentage points. our effective income tax rate and cash tax payments in years after 2017 are expected to benefit materially from the enactment of the tax act. as of december 22, 2018, we completed our accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax effects of the tax act and did not identify any material changes to the provisional, net, one-time charge for the year ended december 31, 2017, related to the tax act.
we recognized a new tax benefit in 2018 of $61 million related to the deduction for foreign derived intangible income enacted by the tax act, which reduced our effective income tax rate by 1.0 percentage point. we also recognized a tax benefit of $61 million in 2018, which reduced our effective income tax rate by 1.0 percentage point, from our change in a tax accounting method reflecting a 2012 court of federal claims decision, which held that the tax basis in certain assets should be increased and realized upon the assets' disposition.
the rates for all periods benefited from tax deductions for dividends paid to our defined contribution plans with an employee stock ownership plan feature, and the u.s. research and development (r&d) tax credit. the tax act repealed the u.s. manufacturing benefit for years after 2017. the u.s. manufacturing benefit for 2017 was insignificant, compared to a reduction of our effective tax rate by 2.5 percentage points for 2016. the 2017 benefit was reduced by $81 million because of our 2017 decision after enactment of the tax act to make accelerated contributions of cash in 2018 to our defined benefit pension plans. the r&d tax credit reduced our effective tax rate by 2.4 percentage points in 2018 and 2.2 percentage points in both 2017 and 2016. the rate for 2016 also benefited from the nontaxable gain recorded in connection with the consolidation of awe.
in addition, the rates for 2018, 2017, and 2016 benefited from tax benefits related to employee share-based payment awards, which are now recorded in earnings as income tax benefit or expense, effective with the adoption of an accounting standard update during 2016. accordingly, we recognized additional income tax benefits of $55 million, $106 million, and $152 million during the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, which reduced our effective income tax rate by 0.9 percentage points, 2.0 percentage points, and 3.2 percentage points.
future changes in tax laws could significantly impact our provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, our deferred tax asset and liability balances, and stockholders' equity. the amount of net deferred tax assets will change periodically based on several factors, including the measurement of our postretirement benefit plan obligations, actual cash contributions to our postretirement benefit plans, and future changes in tax laws.
33
net earnings from continuing operations we reported net earnings from continuing operations of $5.0 billion ($17.59 per share) in 2018, $1.9 billion ($6.50 per share) in 2017 and $3.7 billion ($12.08 per share) in 2016. both net earnings and earnings per share from continuing operations were affected by the factors mentioned above. earnings per share also benefited from a net decrease of approximately 3.0 million common shares outstanding from december 31, 2017 to december 31, 2018 as a result of share repurchases, partially offset by share issuance under our stock-based awards and certain defined contribution plans. from december 31, 2016 to december 31, 2017 earnings per share benefited from a decrease of approximately 5.0 million common shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases, partially offset by share issuance under our stock-based awards and certain defined contribution plans.
net earnings from discontinued operations we reported net earnings from discontinued operations related to the 2016 divestiture of the is&gs business of $73 million ($0.25 per share) in 2017 and $1.5 billion ($4.99 per share) in 2016. net earnings from discontinued operations in 2017 reflects certain post-closing adjustments, including final working capital and tax adjustments. net earnings from discontinued operations in 2016 included an initial net gain of approximately $1.2 billion recognized as a result of the divestiture of the is&gs business.
net earnings we reported net earnings of $5.0 billion ($17.59 per share) in 2018, $2.0 billion ($6.75 per share) in 2017 and $5.2 billion ($17.07 per share) in 2016.
business segment results of operations we operate in four business segments: aeronautics, mfc, rms and space. we organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered. the financial information in the following tables includes the results of businesses we have acquired from their respective dates of acquisition and excludes businesses included in discontinued operations (see "note 3 - acquisition and divestitures" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements) for all years presented. net sales of our business segments exclude intersegment sales as these activities are eliminated in consolidation.
operating profit of our business segments includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees because the operating activities of the equity method investees are closely aligned with the operations of our business segments. united launch alliance (ula), results of which are included in our space business segment, is one of our largest equity method investees. operating profit of our business segments excludes the fas/cas operating adjustment for our qualified defined benefit pension plans (described below); the adjustment from cas to the fas service cost component for all other postretirement benefit plans; expense for stock-based compensation; the effects of items not considered part of management's evaluation of segment operating performance, such as charges related to goodwill impairments (see "note 1 - significant accounting policies" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements) and significant severance and restructuring actions (see "note 15 - severance and restructuring charges" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements); gains or losses from significant divestitures (see "note 3 - acquisition and divestitures" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements); the effects of certain legal settlements; corporate costs not allocated to our business segments; and other miscellaneous corporate activities. these items are included in the reconciling item "unallocated items" between operating profit from our business segments and our consolidated operating profit.
our business segments' results of operations include pension expense only as calculated under u.s. government cost accounting standards, which we refer to as cas pension cost. we recover cas pension cost through the pricing of our products and services on u.s. government contracts and, therefore, the cas pension cost is recognized in each of our business segments' net sales and cost of sales. our consolidated operating profit in our consolidated financial statements must present the service cost component of fas pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense calculated in accordance with fas requirements under u.s. gaap. the operating portion of the net fas/cas operating adjustment represents the difference between the service cost component of fas pension expense and the cas pension cost recorded in our business segments' results of operations. the non-service fas pension and other postretirement benefit plan cost component is included in other non-operating expenses, net on our consolidated statement of earnings. as a result, to the extent that cas pension cost exceeds the service cost component of fas pension expense, which occurred for 2018, 2017 and 2016, we have a favorable fas/cas operating adjustment.

(a)   on august 24, 2016, our ownership interest in the awe joint venture increased from 33% to 51% and we were required to change our accounting for this investment from the equity method to consolidation. as a result of the increased ownership interest, we recognized a non-cash gain of $127 million at our space business segment, which increased net earnings from continuing operations by $104 million ($0.34 per share) in 2016. see "note 3 - acquisition and divestitures" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements for more information).

(a)   we record the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost as part of other non-operating expense, net in the consolidated statement of earnings. the non-service cost components in the table above relate only to our qualified defined benefit pension plans. we incurred total non-service costs for our qualified defined benefit pension plans in the table above, along with similar costs for our other postretirement benefit plans of $67 million, $109 million, and $123 million for the years ended 2018, 2017 and 2016.
we recover cas pension cost through the pricing of our products and services on u.s. government contracts and, therefore, recognize cas pension cost in each of our business segment's net sales and cost of sales. our consolidated financial statements must present fas pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense calculated in accordance with fas requirements under u.s. gaap. the operating portion of the net fas/cas pension adjustment represents the difference between the service cost component of fas pension expense and cas pension cost. the non-service fas pension cost component is included in other non-operating expense, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. the net fas/cas pension adjustment increases or decreases cas pension cost to equal total fas pension expense (both service and non-service).
the following segment discussions also include information relating to backlog for each segment. backlog was approximately $130.5 billion, $105.5 billion and $103.5 billion at december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. these amounts included both funded backlog (firm orders for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not yet been appropriated). backlog does not include unexercised options or task orders to be issued under indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contracts. funded backlog was approximately $86.4 billion at december 31, 2018.
management evaluates performance on our contracts by focusing on net sales and operating profit and not by type or amount of operating expense. consequently, our discussion of business segment performance focuses on net sales and operating profit, consistent with our approach for managing the business. this approach is consistent throughout the life cycle of our contracts, as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sales and operating profit and monitors performance on our contracts in a similar manner through their completion.
we regularly provide customers with reports of our costs as the contract progresses. the cost information in the reports is accumulated in a manner specified by the requirements of each contract. for example, cost data provided to a customer for a product would typically align to the subcomponents of that product (such as a wing-box on an aircraft) and for services would align to the type of work being performed (such as aircraft sustainment). our contracts generally allow for the recovery of costs in the pricing of our products and services. most of our contracts are bid and negotiated with our customers under circumstances in which we are required to disclose our estimated total costs to provide the product or service. this approach for negotiating contracts with our u.s. government customers generally allows for the recovery of our costs. we also may enter into long-term supply contracts for certain materials or components to coincide with the production schedule of certain products and to ensure their availability at known unit prices.
many of our contracts span several years and include highly complex technical requirements. at the outset of a contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of total costs to complete the contract. the estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements required under certain contracts with international customers). the initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding
36
the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract. conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase. all of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate.
we have a number of programs that are designated as classified by the u.s. government which cannot be specifically described. the operating results of these classified programs are included in our consolidated and business segment results and are subjected to the same oversight and internal controls as our other programs.
our net sales are primarily derived from long-term contracts for products and services provided to the u.s. government as well as fms contracted through the u.s. government. we recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. for performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts. for performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied.
changes in net sales and operating profit generally are expressed in terms of volume. changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in sales or operating profit resulting from varying production activity levels or service levels on individual contracts. volume changes in segment operating profit are typically based on the current profit booking rate for a particular contract.
in addition, comparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margins may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to complete and a reduction in the profit booking rate. increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. segment operating profit and margins may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items. favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; severance and restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions, which are excluded from segment operating results; reserves for disputes; asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets. segment operating profit and items such as risk retirements, reductions of profit booking rates or other matters are presented net of state income taxes.
as previously disclosed, we have a program, eadge-t, to design, integrate, and install an air missile defense command, control, communications, computers - intelligence (c4i) system for an international customer that has experienced performance matters and for which we have periodically accrued reserves. in 2017, we revised our estimated costs to complete the eadge-t contract as a consequence of ongoing performance matters and recorded an additional charge of $120 million ($74 million or $0.25 per share, after tax) at our rms business segment, which resulted in cumulative losses of approximately $260 million on this program. as of december 31, 2018, cumulative losses remained at approximately $260 million. we continue to monitor program requirements and our performance. at this time, we do not anticipate additional charges that would be material to our operating results or financial condition.
we have two commercial satellite programs, for the delivery of three satellites in total, to international customers at our space business segment, for which we have experienced performance issues related to the development and integration of a modernized lm 2100 satellite platform. these programs require the development of new satellite technology to enhance the lm 2100's power, propulsion and electronics, among other items. the enhanced lm 2100 satellite platform is expected to benefit other commercial and government satellite programs. we have periodically revised our estimated costs to complete these developmental commercial programs. we have recorded cumulative losses of approximately $380 million through december 31, 2018. in 2018, we recorded losses of approximately $75 million ($56 million, or $0.20 per share, after tax). while these losses reflect our estimated total losses on the programs, we will continue to incur general and administrative costs each period until we complete these programs. these programs remain developmental and further challenges in the delivery and integration of new satellite technology, anomalies discovered during system testing requiring repair or rework, further schedule delays and potential penalties could require that we record additional loss reserves which could be material to our operating results. we previously disclosed that, as we did not meet the july 2018 delivery requirement for two satellites, the customer could seek to exercise termination rights. one of the satellites has now been launched, eliminating this risk. as the other is expected to launch in the first half of 2019, we believe it unlikely that the customer will seek to do so. were the customer to seek to exercise a termination right and be successful in this effort, we would have to refund the payments we have received and pay certain penalties. on the third satellite, we currently anticipate delivery before the date upon which the customer could seek to exercise a termination right although we may have to pay certain penalties and have sought to address this possibility in our reserves.
37
we are responsible for designing, developing and installing an upgraded turret for the warrior capability sustainment program. in 2018, we revised our estimated costs to complete the program as a consequence of performance issues, and recorded a charge of approximately $85 million ($64 million, or $0.22 per share, after tax) at our mfc business segment, which resulted in cumulative losses of approximately $140 million on this program as of december 31, 2018. we may continue to experience issues related to customer requirements and our performance under this contract and have to record additional charges. however, based on the losses already recorded and our current estimate of the sales and costs to complete the program, at this time we do not anticipate that additional losses, if any, would be material to our operating results or financial condition.
our consolidated net adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other items, net of state income taxes, increased segment operating profit by approximately $1.9 billion in 2018, $1.6 billion in 2017 and $1.4 billion in 2016. the increase in consolidated net adjustments in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to increases in profit booking rate adjustments at our mfc, rms, and space business segments, partially offset by a decrease at our aeronautics business segment. the increase in our consolidated net adjustments in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increases in profit booking rate adjustments at our aeronautics and space business segments, partially offset by a decrease at our rms business segment. the consolidated net adjustments for 2018 are inclusive of approximately $900 million in unfavorable items, which include reserves for performance matters on the warrior capability sustainment program at mfc, various programs at rms, and commercial satellite programs at space. the consolidated net adjustments for 2017 are inclusive of approximately $800 million in unfavorable items, which include reserves for performance matters on the eadge-t contract, vertical launching system (vls) program and other programs at rms and on commercial satellite programs at space. the consolidated net adjustments for 2016 are inclusive of approximately $535 million in unfavorable items, which include reserves for performance matters on the eadge-t contract at rms and on commercial satellite programs at space.
aeronautics our aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. aeronautics' major programs include the f-35 lightning ii joint strike fighter, c‐130 hercules, f-16 fighting falcon and f-22 raptor. aeronautics' operating results included the following (in millions):

net sales                   $21,242             $19,410             $17,293

backlog at year-end         $55,601             $35,692             $34,999
2018 compared to 2017
aeronautics' net sales in 2018 increased $1.8 billion, or 9%, compared to 2017. the increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $1.5 billion for the f-35 program due to increased volume on production and sustainment, partially offset by lower volume on development activities; about $300 million for other programs due to higher volume (primarily adp); about $210 million for the f-16 program due to increased volume on modernization contracts; and about $110 million for the f-22 program due to increased sustainment volume. these increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $130 million for the c-130 program primarily due to lower volume on sustainment activities and about $130 million for the c-5 program due to lower volume as deliveries under the current production modernization program were completed in the third quarter of 2018.
aeronautics' operating profit in 2018 increased $96 million, or 4%, compared to 2017. operating profit increased approximately $250 million for the f-35 program due to increased volume on higher margin production contracts and new development activities and better performance on sustainment. this increase was partially offset by a decrease of about $65 million for the c-130 program due to lower risk retirements and lower sustainment volume; about $60 million for the f-16 program due to lower risk retirements; and about $35 million for the c-5 program due to lower risk retirements and lower production volume. adjustments not related to volume, primarily net profit booking rate adjustments, were about $175 million lower in 2018 compared to 2017.
2017 compared to 2016
aeronautics' net sales in 2017 increased $2.1 billion, or 12%, compared to 2016. the increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $2.0 billion for the f-35 program due to increased volume on production and sustainment; about $155 million for the c-130 program primarily due to increased production volume and due to aircraft configuration mix; and about
38
$95 million for the f-22 program due to higher volume on aircraft modernization programs. these increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $195 million for the c-5 program due to lower production volume.
aeronautics' operating profit in 2017 increased $331 million, or 18%, compared to 2016. operating profit increased approximately $300 million for the f-35 program due to increased volume on aircraft production and sustainment activities and higher risk retirements and about $85 million for the f-16 program due to higher risk retirements partially offset by lower volume on aircraft modernization programs. these increases were partially offset by a decrease of about $30 million due to lower equity earnings from an investee. adjustments not related to volume, primarily net profit booking rate adjustments, were about $245 million higher in 2017 compared to 2016.
backlog backlog increased in 2018 compared to 2017 and in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to higher orders on f-35 production and sustainment programs.
trends we currently expect aeronautics' 2019 net sales to increase in the high-single digit percentage range as compared to 2018 driven by the increased volume on the f-35 program. operating profit is also expected to increase in the high-single digit percentage range, resulting in comparable operating profit margins in 2019 as compared to 2018.

2018 compared to 2017
mfc's net sales in 2018 increased $1.2 billion, or 16%, compared to the same period in 2017. the increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $925 million for tactical and strike missile programs due to increased volume (primarily classified programs and precision fires); and about $185 million for sensors and global sustainment programs due to increased volume (primarily lantirn, sniper, and apache).
mfc's operating profit in 2018 increased $214 million, or 21%, compared to 2017. operating profit increased approximately $140 million for tactical and strike missile programs due to reserves which were recorded in 2017 but did not recur in 2018 (primarily joint air to ground missile (jagm)), higher risk retirements (primarily precision fires and hellfire) and higher volume (primarily precision fires); and about $50 million for sensors and global sustainment programs due to higher risk retirements and higher volume (primarily lantirn, sniper, and apache), after charges of approximately $85 million previously recorded in 2018 for performance matters on the warrior capability sustainment program. adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other items, were about $200 million higher in 2018 compared to 2017.
2017 compared to 2016
mfc's net sales in 2017 increased $493 million, or 7%, compared to 2016. the increase was attributable to higher net sales of approximately $205 million for integrated air and missile defense programs due to contract mix on certain programs (primarily pac-3) and increased volume on certain programs (primarily thaad); and about $135 million for sensors and global sustainment programs due to increased volume (primarily sof glss and lantirn and sniper); and about $110 million for tactical and strike missile programs due to product configuration mix (primarily precision fires) and increased volume (primarily classified programs).
39
mfc's operating profit in 2017 increased $30 million, or 3%, compared to 2016. operating profit increased about $85 million for integrated air and missile defense programs due to increased volume (primarily thaad), contract mix (primarily pac-3), and a reserve recorded in fiscal year 2016 for a contractual matter that did not recur in 2017; and about $85 million for sensors and global sustainment programs due to increased risk retirements and higher volume (primarily lantirn and sniper). these increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $120 million for tactical and strike missile programs due to lower risk retirements (primarily precision fires and hellfire) and the establishment of a reserve on a program. adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other items, were about $10 million higher in 2017 compared to 2016.
backlog backlog increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to higher orders on pac-3, precision fires, and other tactical missiles programs. backlog increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to higher orders on hellfire, precision fires and pac-3.
trends we currently expect mfc's net sales to increase in the low-double digit percentage range in 2019 as compared to 2018 driven by key contract awards in 2018 and higher volume in the tactical and strike missiles business. operating profit is expected to increase in the high-single digit percentage range in 2019 as compared to 2018 driven by the increase in sales volume. operating profit margin for 2019 is expected to be slightly lower than 2018 levels.
rotary and mission systems our rms business segment provides design, manufacture, service and support for a variety of military and commercial helicopters; ship and submarine mission and combat systems; mission systems and sensors for rotary and fixed-wing aircraft; sea and land-based missile defense systems; radar systems; the littoral combat ship (lcs); simulation and training services; and unmanned systems and technologies. in addition, rms supports the needs of government customers in cybersecurity and delivers communication and command and control capabilities through complex mission solutions for defense applications. rms' major programs include black hawk and seahawk helicopters, aegis combat system (aegis), lcs, ch-53k king stallion helicopter, vh-92a helicopter program, advanced hawkeye radar system, and the command, control, battle management and communications (c2bmc) contract. additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2017, we realigned certain programs within the rms business segment to align with changes in management structure. rms' operating results included the following (in millions):
2018                2017                2016
net sales                   $14,250             $13,663             $13,595

backlog at year-end         $31,320             $30,030             $29,029
2018 compared to 2017
rms' net sales in 2018 increased $587 million, or 4%, compared to 2017. the increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $525 million for iwss programs due to higher volume (primarily radar surveillance systems programs and multi mission surface combatant); and about $250 million for c6isr programs due to higher volume on multiple programs. these increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $270 million for sikorsky helicopter programs, which reflect lower volume for black hawk production, partially offset by higher volume for ch-53k king stallion development and for mission systems programs.
rms' operating profit in 2018 increased $400 million, or 44%, compared to 2017. operating profit increased approximately $185 million for c6isr programs due to charges of $120 million for performance matters on the eadge-t contract, recorded in 2017 but which did not recur in 2018, and due to higher risk retirements (primarily undersea systems programs); about $155 million for sikorsky helicopter programs due to better cost performance across the sikorsky portfolio and better cost performance on the multi-year ix contract; and about $105 million for iwss programs due to higher risk retirements and higher volume (primarily aegis). adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other items, were about $185 million higher in 2018 compared to 2017.
40
2017 compared to 2016
rms' net sales in 2017 increased $68 million, or 1%, compared to 2016. the increase was primarily attributable to approximately $85 million for training and logistics services programs due to higher volume; about $55 million for iwss programs due to higher volume (primarily aegis); and about $40 million for sikorsky helicopter programs due to certain adjustments recorded in 2016 required to account for the acquisition, partially offset by lower volume on certain helicopter programs. these increases were partially offset by a decrease of about $100 million for c6isr programs due to lower volume.
rms' operating profit in 2017 increased $57 million, or 7%, compared to 2016. operating profit increased about $120 million for sikorsky helicopter programs due to certain adjustments recorded in 2016 required to account for the acquisition; and about $30 million for iwss programs due to higher volume and increased risk retirements, partially offset by a $20 million charge for performance matters on the vertical launching system (vls) program. this increase was offset by a decrease of $105 million for c6isr programs primarily due to a net $95 million increase for charges for performance matters on the eadge-t contract. adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other items, were about $45 million lower in 2017 compared to 2016.
backlog backlog increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to higher orders on iwss and c6isr programs. backlog increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a new multi-year award at sikorsky.
trends we currently expect rms' net sales to be slightly above 2018 levels. operating profit is also expected to be slightly above 2018 levels resulting in similar operating profit margins in 2019 as compared to 2018.
space our space business segment is engaged in the research and development, design, engineering and production of satellites, strategic and defensive missile systems and space transportation systems. space provides network-enabled situational awareness and integrates complex space and ground-based global systems to help our customers gather, analyze, and securely distribute critical intelligence data. space is also responsible for various classified systems and services in support of vital national security systems. space's major programs include the trident ii d5 fleet ballistic missile (fbm), awe, orion multi-purpose crew vehicle (orion), space based infrared system (sbirs) and next generation overhead persistent infrared (next gen opir) system, global positioning system (gps) iii, advanced extremely high frequency (aehf), and the mobile user objective system (muos). operating profit for our space business segment includes our share of earnings for our investment in ula, which provides expendable launch services to the u.s. government. space's operating results included the following (in millions):
2018                2017                2016
net sales                    $9,808              $9,605              $9,613
operating profit              1,055                 980               1,288
operating margin               10.8   %            10.2   %            13.4   %
backlog at year-end         $22,184             $22,042             $25,226
2018 compared to 2017
space's net sales in 2018 increased $203 million, or 2%, compared to 2017. the increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $225 million for strategic and missile defense programs due to higher volume (primarily awe and fbm) and about $65 million for the orion program due to higher volume. these increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $70 million for commercial satellite programs due to lower volume and about $25 million for government satellite programs due to lower volume.
space's operating profit in 2018 increased $75 million, or 8%, compared to 2017. operating profit increased approximately $40 million for commercial satellite programs, which reflect a lower amount of charges recorded for performance matters on certain programs; and about $30 million for government satellite programs primarily due to higher volume and higher risk retirements for government satellite services. adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other items, were about $30 million higher in 2018 compared to 2017.
41
2017 compared to 2016
space's net sales in 2017 were comparable with 2016. the slight decrease was attributable to a decrease of approximately $300 million for space transportation programs due to a reduction in launch-related events; about $245 million for government satellite programs (primarily aehf and sbirs) due to lower volume; approximately $190 million across other programs (including the orion program) due to lower volume; and about $90 million for commercial satellite programs due to lower volume. these decreases were partially offset by an increase of approximately $810 million due to a full year of net sales from awe in 2017 compared to four months of sales in 2016, which we began consolidating during the third quarter of 2016.
space's operating profit in 2017 decreased $308 million, or 24%, compared to 2016. operating profit decreased $127 million due to the pre-tax gain recorded in 2016 related to the consolidation of awe; about $95 million for lower equity earnings from ula; about $30 million for space transportation programs due to a reduction in launch-related events; about $35 million for government satellite programs (primarily sbirs and aehf) due to a charge for performance matters and lower volume; and a net decrease of about $35 million related to charges recorded in 2017 for performance matters on certain commercial satellite programs. adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other items, were about $20 million higher in 2017 compared to 2016.
equity earnings total equity earnings recognized by space (primarily ula) represented approximately $210 million, $205 million and $325 million, or 20%, 21% and 25% of this business segment's operating profit during 2018, 2017 and 2016.
backlog backlog increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to new orders on government satellite programs, specifically next gen opir and gps iii. backlog decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to lower orders for government satellite programs, partially offset by higher orders on the orion program.
trends we currently expect space's 2019 net sales to be comparable to 2018 levels. operating profit in 2019 is expected to decrease in the low-double digit percentage range as compared to 2018 driven by lower equity earnings in 2019 compared to 2018. as a result, operating profit margin in 2019 is expected to decrease from 2018 levels.
liquidity and cash flows we have a balanced cash deployment strategy to enhance stockholder value and position ourselves to take advantage of new business opportunities when they arise. consistent with that strategy, we have continued to invest in our business, including capital expenditures, independent research and development and, selective business acquisitions and investments, while returning cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases, and managing our debt levels, maturities and interest rates and pension obligations.
we have generated strong operating cash flows, which have been the primary source of funding for our operations, capital expenditures, debt service and repayments, dividends, share repurchases and postretirement benefit plan contributions. our strong operating cash flows enabled our board of directors to approve two key cash deployment initiatives in september 2018. first, we increased our dividend rate in the fourth quarter by 10% to $2.20 per share. second, the board of directors approved a $1.0 billion increase to our share repurchase program. inclusive of this increase, the total remaining authorization for future common share repurchases under our program was $3.0 billion as of december 31, 2018.
we expect our cash from operations will continue to be sufficient to support our operations and anticipated capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. however, we expect to continue to issue commercial paper backed by our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility to manage the timing of cash flows. we also have additional access to credit markets, if needed, for liquidity or general corporate purposes, and letters of credit to support customer advance payments and for other trade finance purposes such as guaranteeing our performance on particular contracts. see our "capital structure, resources and other" section below for a discussion on available financial resources.
we made contributions of $5.0 billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2018, including required and discretionary contributions. as a result of these contributions, we do not expect to make contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2019. we funded these contributions in 2018 using a mix of cash on hand and commercial paper.
42
during 2016, we received a one-time, tax-free special cash payment of approximately $1.8 billion as a result of the divestiture of the is&gs business in the third quarter of 2016. we used the proceeds to repay $500 million of long-term notes at their scheduled maturity and paid $484 million in dividends with a portion of this cash. the remainder was used for share repurchases.
cash received from customers, either from the payment of invoices for work performed or for advances in excess of costs incurred, is our primary source of cash. we generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the customer. however, we may determine to fund customer programs ourselves pending government appropriations and are doing so with increased frequency. if we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on the contract, we may be at risk for reimbursement of the excess costs.
billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including the contract type. we generally bill and collect cash more frequently under cost-reimbursable contracts, which represent approximately 38% of the sales we recorded in 2018, as we are authorized to bill as the costs are incurred. a number of our fixed-price contracts may provide for performance-based payments, which allow us to bill and collect cash as we perform on the contract. the amount of performance-based payments and the related milestones are encompassed in the negotiation of each contract. the timing of such payments may differ from our incurrence of costs related to our contract performance, thereby affecting our cash flows.
the u.s. government has indicated that it would consider progress payments as the baseline for negotiating payment terms on fixed-price contracts, rather than performance-based payments. in contrast to negotiated performance-based payment terms, progress payment provisions correspond to a percentage of the amount of costs incurred during the performance of the contract. while the total amount of cash collected on a contract is the same, performance-based payments have had a more favorable impact on the timing of our cash flows. in addition, our cash flows may be affected if the u.s. government decides to withhold payments on our billings. while the impact of withholding payments delays the receipt of cash, the cumulative amount of cash collected during the life of the contract will not vary.
the majority of our capital expenditures for 2018 and those planned for 2019 are for equipment, facilities infrastructure and information technology. expenditures for equipment and facilities infrastructure are generally incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. for example, we have projects underway in our aeronautics business segment for facilities and equipment to support higher production of the f-35 combat aircraft, and we have projects underway to modernize certain of our facilities. we also incur capital expenditures for information technology to support programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure, inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use software.
the following table provides a summary of our cash flow information followed by a discussion of the key elements (in millions):
2018                         2017                2016

operating activities
2018 compared to 2017
net cash provided by operating activities decreased $3.3 billion in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to contributions of $5.0 billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2018 and an increase in cash used for working capital of $974 million, partially offset by an increase in net earnings and a decrease in income tax payments. the increase in cash used for working capital was largely driven by the timing of cash collections for the f-35 program and sikorsky helicopter programs. we received net income tax refunds of $41 million during the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to making net income tax payments of $1.1 billion during the year ended december 31, 2017. net refunds in 2018 were primarily the result a 2017 net operating loss carryback arising from our accelerated pension contributions. our effective income tax rate and cash tax payments in 2018 benefited
43
materially from the enactment of the tax act in 2017. we made interest payments of approximately $635 million and approximately $610 million during the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017.
2017 compared to 2016
net cash provided by operating activities increased $1.3 billion in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a decrease in cash used for working capital, a reduction in cash paid for income taxes and a reduction in cash paid for severance. the decrease in cash used for working capital was largely driven by timing of cash collections (primarily pac-3, thaad, lantirn and sniper, and sikorsky helicopter programs). we made net income tax payments of $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion during the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016. we made interest payments of approximately $610 million and approximately $600 million during the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016. in addition, cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december 31, 2016 included cash generated by is&gs of approximately $310 million as we retained this cash as part of the divestiture.
investing activities net cash used for investing activities decreased $72 million in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to approximately $105 million of cash received as part of the final settlement of net working capital in connection with the 2016 divestiture of our is&gs business and cash received for various other items, none of which were individually significant, partially offset by higher capital expenditures. net cash used for investing activities increased $162 million in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to higher capital expenditures and cash proceeds received in 2016 related to properties sold.
capital expenditures amounted to $1.3 billion in 2018, $1.2 billion in 2017 and $1.1 billion in 2016. the majority of our capital expenditures were for equipment and facilities infrastructure that generally are incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. we also incur capital expenditures for information technology to support programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure, inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use-software.
financing activities net cash used for financing activities decreased $153 million in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to $600 million of net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and a reduction in cash used for repurchases of common stock, partially offset by the repayment of long-term debt in 2018 and an increase in dividend payments.
net cash used for financing activities increased $848 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the receipt of a one-time special cash payment in 2016 from the divestiture of the is&gs business and higher dividend payments in 2017, partially offset by the repayment of long-term debt in 2016 and a reduction in cash used for repurchases of common stock.
in november 2018, we repaid $750 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 1.85% according to their scheduled maturities. in september 2016, we repaid $500 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 2.13% according to their scheduled maturities. in may 2016, we repaid $452 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 7.65% according to their scheduled maturities.
for additional information about our debt financing activities see the "capital structure, resources and other" discussion below and "note 10 - debt" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements.
we paid dividends totaling $2.3 billion ($8.20 per share) in 2018, $2.2 billion ($7.46 per share) in 2017 and $2.0 billion ($6.77 per share) in 2016. we paid quarterly dividends of $2.00 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2018 and $2.20 per share during the fourth quarter of 2018; $1.82 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2017 and $2.00 per share during the fourth quarter of 2017; and $1.65 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2016 and $1.82 per share during the fourth quarter of 2016.
we paid $1.5 billion, $2.0 billion and $2.1 billion to repurchase 4.7 million, 7.1 million and 8.9 million shares of our common stock during 2018, 2017 and 2016.

capital structure, resources and other at december 31, 2018, we held cash and cash equivalents of $772 million that was generally available to fund ordinary business operations without significant legal, regulatory, or other restrictions.
our outstanding debt, net of unamortized discounts and issuance costs, amounted to $14.1 billion at december 31, 2018 and is mainly in the form of publicly-issued notes that bear interest at fixed rates. as of december 31, 2018, we had $1.5 billion of short-term borrowings due within one year, of which approximately $900 million was composed of scheduled debt maturity due in november 2019 and approximately $600 million was composed of commercial paper borrowings with a weighted-average rate of 2.89%. during 2017, we borrowed and fully repaid amounts under our commercial paper programs. there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of december 31, 2017. as of december 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our debt and credit agreements.
we actively seek to finance our business in a manner that preserves financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing costs to the extent practicable. we review changes in financial market and economic conditions to manage the types, amounts and maturities of our indebtedness. we may at times refinance existing indebtedness, vary our mix of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt or seek alternative financing sources for our cash and operational needs.
on occasion, our customers may seek deferred payment terms to purchase our products. in connection with these transactions, we may, at our customer's request, enter into arrangements for the non-recourse sale of customer receivables to unrelated third-party financial institutions. for accounting purposes, these transactions are not discounted and are treated as a sale of receivables as we have no continuing involvement. the sale proceeds from the financial institutions are reflected in our operating cash flows on the statement of cash flows. we sold approximately $532 million in 2018 and $698 million in 2017 of customer receivables. there were no gains or losses related to sales of these receivables.
revolving credit facilities on august 24, 2018, we entered into a new $2.5 billion revolving credit facility (the 5-year facility) with various banks and concurrently terminated our existing $2.5 billion revolving credit facility. the 5‐year facility has an expiration date of august 24, 2023 and is available for general corporate purposes. the undrawn portion of the 5-year facility is also available to serve as a backup facility for the issuance of commercial paper. we may request and the banks may grant, at their discretion, an increase in the borrowing capacity under the 5-year facility of up to an additional $500 million. there were no borrowings outstanding under the 5-year facility as of december 31, 2018 and 2017.
borrowings under the 5-year facility are unsecured and bear interest at rates based, at our option, on a eurodollar rate or a base rate, as defined in the 5-year facility's agreement. each bank's obligation to make loans under the 5-year facility is subject to, among other things, our compliance with various representations, warranties, and covenants, including covenants limiting our ability and certain of our subsidiaries' ability to encumber assets and a covenant not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the 5‐year facility agreement.
long-term debt in november 2018, we repaid $750 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 1.85% according to their scheduled maturities.
in september 2017, we issued notes totaling approximately $1.6 billion with a fixed interest rate of 4.09% maturing in september 2052 (the new notes) in exchange for outstanding notes totaling approximately $1.4 billion with fixed interest rates ranging from 4.70% to 8.50% maturing 2029 to 2046 (the old notes). in connection with the exchange of principal, we paid a premium of $237 million, substantially all of which was in the form of new notes. this premium will be amortized as additional interest expense over the term of the new notes using the effective interest method. we may, at our option, redeem some or all of the new notes at any time by paying the principal amount of notes being redeemed plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest. interest on the new notes is payable on march 15 and september 15 of each year and began on march 15, 2018. the new notes are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
in september 2016, we repaid $500 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 2.13% according to their scheduled maturities. in may 2016, we repaid $452 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 7.65% according to their scheduled maturities. we also had related variable interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $450 million mature, which did not have a significant impact on net earnings or comprehensive income.
45
we have an effective shelf registration statement on form s-3 on file with the u.s. securities and exchange commission to provide for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities.
total equity our total equity was $1.4 billion at december 31, 2018 compared to a deficit of $776 million at december 31, 2017. the increase in equity was primarily due to net earnings of $5.0 billion, recognition of previously deferred postretirement benefit plan amounts of $1.2 billion, and employee stock activity of $406 million (including the impacts of stock option exercises, esop activity and stock-based compensation), partially offset by the annual december 31 re-measurement adjustment related to our postretirement benefit plans of $501 million, the repurchase of 4.7 million common shares for $1.5 billion; and dividends declared of $2.3 billion during the year.
as we repurchase our common shares, we reduce common stock for the $1 of par value of the shares repurchased, with the excess purchase price over par value recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. if additional paid-in capital is reduced to zero, we record the remainder of the excess purchase price over par value as a reduction of retained earnings. due to the volume of repurchases made under our share repurchase program, additional paid-in capital was reduced to zero, with the remainder of the excess purchase price over par value of $1.1 billion recorded as a reduction of retained earnings in 2018.
contractual commitments and off-balance sheet arrangements at december 31, 2018, we had contractual commitments to repay debt, make payments under operating leases, settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services and settle tax and other liabilities. capital lease obligations were not material. payments due under these obligations and commitments are as follows (in millions):
payments due by period total             less than1 year            years 2 and 3            years 4 and 5            after 5 years total debt (a)                             $15,299                  $1,500                    $2,150                     $625                  $11,024

(a)   total debt includes scheduled principal payments and the repayment of commercial paper and excludes approximately $13 million of debt issued by a consolidated joint venture as we do not guarantee the debt.
the table above excludes estimated minimum funding requirements for our qualified defined benefit pension plans. for additional information about our future minimum contributions for these plans, see "note 11 - postretirement benefit plans" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements. amounts related to other liabilities represent the contractual obligations for certain long-term liabilities recorded as of december 31, 2018. such amounts mainly include expected payments under non-qualified pension plans, environmental liabilities and deferred compensation plans.
purchase obligations related to operating activities include agreements and contracts that give the supplier recourse to us for cancellation or nonperformance under the contract or contain terms that would subject us to liquidated damages. such agreements and contracts may, for example, be related to direct materials, obligations to subcontractors and outsourcing arrangements. total purchase obligations for operating activities in the preceding table include approximately $45.9 billion related to contractual commitments entered into as a result of contracts we have with our u.s. government customers. the u.s. government generally would be required to pay us for any costs we incur relative to these commitments if they were to terminate the related contracts "for convenience" under the federal acquisition regulation (far), subject to available funding. this also would be true in cases where we perform subcontract work for a prime contractor under a u.s. government contract. the termination for convenience language also may be included in contracts with foreign, state and local governments. we also have contracts with customers that do not include termination for convenience provisions, including contracts with commercial customers.
purchase obligations in the preceding table for capital expenditures generally include facilities infrastructure, equipment and information technology.
46
we also may enter into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries. these agreements are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the foreign country by requiring the contractor to promote investment in the country. offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in-country projects and the purchase by third parties (e.g., our vendors) of supplies from in-country vendors. these agreements also may be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects, establishment of ventures with local companies and building or leasing facilities for in-country operations. we typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. the amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customer and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the original amount in the offset agreement. satisfaction of our offset obligations are included in the estimates of our total costs to complete the contract and may impact our sales, profitability and cash flows. our ability to recover investments on our consolidated balance sheet that we make to satisfy offset obligations is generally dependent upon the successful operation of ventures that we do not control and may involve products and services that are dissimilar to our business activities. at december 31, 2018, the notional value of remaining obligations under our outstanding offset agreements totaled approximately $12.1 billion, which primarily relate to our aeronautics, mfc and rms business segments, most of which extend through 2044. to the extent we have entered into purchase or other obligations at december 31, 2018 that also satisfy offset agreements, those amounts are included in the preceding table. offset programs usually extend over several years and may provide for penalties, estimated at approximately $1.5 billion at december 31, 2018, in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements. while historically we have not been required to pay material penalties, resolution of offset requirements are often the result of negotiations and subjective judgments.
in connection with our 50% ownership interest of ula, we and the boeing company (boeing) were previously required to provide ula an additional capital contribution if ula was unable to make required payments under its inventory supply agreement with boeing. in the fourth quarter of 2018, ula fully satisfied its obligations under this inventory supply agreement and we no longer have any obligation to provide ula an additional capital contribution under this agreement.
we have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds issued on our behalf by financial institutions, and directly issued guarantees to third parties primarily relating to advances received from customers and the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts. letters of credit and surety bonds generally are available for draw down in the event we do not perform. in some cases, we may guarantee the contractual performance of third parties such as venture partners. at december 31, 2018, we had the following outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and third-party guarantees (in millions):
commitment expiration by period total commitment             less than1 year             years2 and 3       years4 and 5             after 5 years standby letters of credit (a)              $2,284                      $1,302                      $707              $247                     $28

(a)   approximately $925 million of standby letters of credit in the "less than 1 year" category, $357 million in the "years 2 and 3" category and $24 million in the "years 4 and 5" category are expected to renew for additional periods until completion of the contractual obligation.
at december 31, 2018, third-party guarantees totaled $850 million, of which approximately 65% related to guarantees of contractual performance of ventures to which we currently are or previously were a party. this amount represents our estimate of the maximum amount we would expect to incur upon the contractual non-performance of the venture, venture partners or divested businesses. generally, we also have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a venture partner.
in determining our exposures, we evaluate the reputation, performance on contractual obligations, technical capabilities and credit quality of our current and former venture partners and the transferee under novation agreements all of which include a guarantee as required by the far. there were no material amounts recorded in our financial statements related to third-party guarantees or novation agreements.

critical accounting policies contract accounting / sales recognition the majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the u.s. government and international customers (including foreign military sales (fms) contracted through the u.s. government) for the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. we provide our products and services under fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts.
under fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. to the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. some fixed-price contracts have a performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance.
cost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. typically, we enter into three types of cost-reimbursable contracts: cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-plus-fixed-fee. cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within specified limits based on the customer's assessment of our performance against a predetermined set of criteria, such as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee, which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (i.e., incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (i.e., incentive based on performance). the fixed-fee in a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is negotiated at the inception of the contract and that fixed-fee does not vary with actual costs.
we account for a contract after it has been approved by all parties to the arrangement, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable.
we assess each contract at its inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contracts. when making this determination, we consider factors such as whether two or more contracts were negotiated and executed at or near the same time or were negotiated with an overall profit objective. if combined, we treat the combined contracts as a single contract for revenue recognition purposes.
we evaluate the products or services promised in each contract at inception to determine whether the contract should be accounted for as having one or more performance obligations. the products and services in our contracts are typically not distinct from one another due to their complex relationships and the significant contract management functions required to perform under the contract. accordingly, our contracts are typically accounted for as one performance obligation. in limited cases, our contracts have more than one distinct performance obligation, which occurs when we perform activities that are not highly complex or interrelated or involve different product lifecycles. significant judgment is required in determining performance obligations, and these decisions could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in a given period. we classify net sales as products or services on our consolidated statements of earnings based on the predominant attributes of the performance obligations.
we determine the transaction price for each contract based on the consideration we expect to receive for the products or services being provided under the contract. for contracts where a portion of the price may vary we estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount, which is included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. we analyze the risk of a significant revenue reversal and if necessary constrain the amount of variable consideration recognized in order to mitigate this risk.
at the inception of a contract we estimate the transaction price based on our current rights and do not contemplate future modifications (including unexercised options) or follow-on contracts until they become legally enforceable. contracts are often subsequently modified to include changes in specifications, requirements or price, which may create new or change existing enforceable rights and obligations. depending on the nature of the modification, we consider whether to account for the modification as an adjustment to the existing contract or as a separate contract. generally, modifications to our contracts are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration and interrelated tasks provided in the context of the contract. therefore, such modifications are accounted for as if they were part of the existing contract and recognized as a cumulative adjustment to revenue.
for contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated standalone selling price of the product or service underlying each performance obligation. the standalone selling price represents the amount we would sell the product or service to a customer on a standalone basis (i.e., not bundled with any other products or services). our contracts with the u.s. government, including fms contracts, are subject to the federal acquisition
48
regulations (far) and the price is typically based on estimated or actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin. as a result of these regulations, the standalone selling price of products or services in our contracts with the u.s. government and fms contracts are typically equal to the selling price stated in the contract.
for non-u.s. government contracts with multiple performance obligations, we evaluate whether the stated selling prices for the products or services represent their standalone selling prices. we primarily sell customized solutions unique to a customer's specifications. when it is necessary to allocate the transaction price to multiple performance obligations, we typically use the expected cost plus a reasonable profit margin to estimate the standalone selling price of each product or service. we occasionally sell standard products or services with observable standalone sales transactions. in these situations, the observable standalone sales transactions are used to determine the standalone selling price.
we recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. in determining when performance obligations are satisfied, we consider factors such as contract terms, payment terms and whether there is an alternative future use of the product or service. substantially all of our revenue is recognized over time as we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfers continuously to the customer. for contracts with the u.s. government and fms contracts, this continuous transfer of control of the work in process to the customer is supported by clauses in the contract that allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience, pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit, and take possession of any work in process. our non-u.s. government contracts, primarily international direct commercial contracts, typically do not include termination for convenience provisions. however, continuous transfer of control to our customer is supported and, if our customer were to terminate the contract for reasons other than our non-performance, we would have the right to recover damages which would include, among other potential damages, the right to payment for our work performed to date plus a reasonable profit to deliver products or services that do not have an alternative use to us.
for performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts. under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the performance obligation(s). for performance obligations to provide services to the customer, revenue is recognized over time based on costs incurred or the right to invoice method (in situations where the value transferred matches our billing rights) as our customer receives and consumes the benefits.
for performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied. this coincides with the point in time the customer obtains control of the product or service, which typically occurs upon customer acceptance or receipt of the product or service, given that we maintain control of the product or service until that point.
significant estimates and assumptions are made in estimating contract sales and costs, including the profit booking rate. at the outset of a long-term contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, as well as variable consideration, and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of sales and total costs to complete the contract. the estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead, general and administrative and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset or localization agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers). the initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract or may increase the variable consideration we expect to receive on the contract. conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase or our estimates of variable consideration we expect to receive decrease. all of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of the transaction price, a provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.
comparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method to measure progress towards completion. increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate. increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. segment operating
49
profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions, which are excluded from segment operating results; reserves for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets.
other contract accounting considerations the majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the u.s. government. cost-based pricing is determined under the far. the far provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under u.s. government contracts. for example, costs such as those related to charitable contributions, interest expense and certain advertising and public relations activities are unallowable and, therefore, not recoverable through sales. in addition, we may enter into advance agreements with the u.s. government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters. for example, most of the environmental costs we incur for environmental remediation related to sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under far provisions and supporting advance agreements reached with the u.s. government.
we closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting. costs incurred and allocated to contracts are reviewed for compliance with u.s. government regulations by our personnel and are subject to audit by the defense contract audit agency.
postretirement benefit plans overview many of our employees participate in qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans, retiree medical and life insurance plans and other postemployment plans (collectively, postretirement benefit plans - see "note 11 - postretirement benefit plans" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements). the majority of our accrued benefit obligations relate to our qualified defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans. we recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the net funded status of these postretirement benefit plans under gaap as either an asset or a liability on our consolidated balance sheets. the gaap funded status represents the difference between the fair value of each plan's assets and the benefit obligation of the plan. the gaap benefit obligation represents the present value of the estimated future benefits we currently expect to pay to plan participants based on past service.
in june 2014, we amended certain of our qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans for non-union employees, comprising the majority of our benefit obligations, to freeze future retirement benefits. the calculation of retirement benefits under the affected defined benefit pension plans is determined by a formula that takes into account the participants' years of credited service and average compensation. the freeze takes effect in two stages. on january 1, 2016, the pay-based component of the formula used to determine retirement benefits was frozen so that future pay increases, annual incentive bonuses or other amounts earned for or related to periods after december 31, 2015 are not used to calculate retirement benefits. on january 1, 2020, the service-based component of the formula used to determine retirement benefits will also be frozen so that participants will no longer earn further credited service for any period after december 31, 2019. when the freeze is complete, the majority of our salaried employees will have transitioned to an enhanced defined contribution retirement savings plan.
additionally, in recent years we have taken other actions to mitigate the effect of our defined benefit pension plan on our financial results. for example, in december 2018, a lockheed martin qualified defined benefit pension plan purchased two contracts from insurance companies covering $2.6 billion of our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations.
first, in december 2018, an upfront cash payment of $810 million was made to an insurance company in exchange for a contract (referred to as a buy-in contract) that will reimburse the plan for all future benefit payments related to $770 million of the plan's outstanding defined benefit pension obligations for approximately 9,000 u.s. retirees and beneficiaries. on december 31, 2018, the approximately 9,000 retirees and beneficiaries and the buy-in contract were spun-off to another plan, with the buy-in contract the sole asset of that plan. under the arrangement, the plan remains responsible for paying the benefits for the covered retirees and beneficiaries and the insurance company will reimburse the plan as those benefits are paid. as a result, there is no net ongoing cash flow to the plan for the covered retirees and beneficiaries as the cost of providing the benefits is funded by the buy-in contract, effectively locking in the cost of the benefits and eliminating future volatility of the benefit obligation. the buy-in contract was purchased using assets from the pension trust and is accounted for at fair value as an investment of the trust. this transaction had no impact on our 2018 fas pension expense or cas pension cost. the difference of approximately $40 million between the amount paid to the insurance company and the amount of the pension obligations funded by the buy-in contract was recognized through the re-measurement of the related benefit obligations in other comprehensive loss in equity and will be amortized

to fas pension expense in future periods. we intend to begin the termination process for this plan during 2019, and at conclusion convert the buy-in contract to a buy-out contract, thus relieving us of liability for the pension obligations related to the covered population. the buy-out conversion, expected to occur as early as 2020, will require recognition of a settlement loss in earnings at that time, which we currently estimate will be approximately $350 million. a subsequent cash recovery is anticipated from the u.s. government.
also, during december 2018, we purchased an irrevocable group annuity contract from an insurance company (referred to as a buy-out contract) for $1.82 billion to settle $1.76 billion of our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations related to certain u.s. retirees and beneficiaries. the group annuity contract was purchased using assets from the pension trust. as a result of this transaction, we were relieved of all responsibility for these pension obligations and the insurance company is now required to pay and administer the retirement benefits owed to approximately 32,000 u.s. retirees and beneficiaries, with no change to the amount, timing or form of monthly retirement benefit payments. although the transaction was treated as a settlement for accounting purposes, we did not recognize a loss on the settlement in earnings associated with the transaction because total settlements during 2018 for this plan were less than this plan's service and interest cost in 2018. accordingly, the transaction had no impact on our 2018 fas pension expense or cas pension cost, and the difference of approximately $60 million between the amount paid to the insurance company and the amount of the pension obligations settled was recognized in other comprehensive loss and will be amortized to fas pension expense in future periods.
notwithstanding these actions, the impact of these plans and benefits on our earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record and the funded status for our postretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because those calculations are sensitive to funding levels as well as changes in several key economic assumptions, including interest rates, actual rates of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions including participant longevity and employee turnover, as well as the timing of cash funding.
actuarial assumptions the plan assets and benefit obligations are measured at the end of each year or more frequently, upon the occurrence of certain events such as a significant plan amendment, settlement or curtailment. the amounts we record are measured using actuarial valuations, which are dependent upon key assumptions such as discount rates, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, participant longevity, employee turnover and the health care cost trend rates for our retiree medical plans. the assumptions we make affect both the calculation of the benefit obligations as of the measurement date and the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in subsequent periods. when reassessing these assumptions we consider past and current market conditions and make judgments about future market trends. we also consider factors such as the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants.
we continue to use a single weighted average discount rate approach when calculating our consolidated benefit obligations related to our defined benefit pension plans resulting in 4.250% at december 31, 2018, compared to 3.625% at december 31, 2017 and 4.125% at december 31, 2016. we utilized a single weighted average discount rate of 4.250% when calculating our benefit obligations related to our retiree medical and life insurance plans at december 31, 2018, compared to 3.625% at december 31, 2017 and 4.00% at december 31, 2016. we evaluate several data points in order to arrive at an appropriate single weighted average discount rate, including results from cash flow models, quoted rates from long-term bond indices and changes in long-term bond rates over the past year. as part of our evaluation, we calculate the approximate average yields on corporate bonds rated aa or better selected to match our projected postretirement benefit plan cash flows.
we utilized an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.00% at december 31, 2018 compared to 7.50% for both december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016. the long-term rate of return assumption represents the expected long-term rate of return on the funds invested or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the benefit obligations. this assumption is based on several factors including historical market index returns, the anticipated long-term allocation of plan assets, the historical return data for the trust funds, plan expenses and the potential to outperform market index returns. the difference between the long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption we select and the actual return on plan assets in any given year affects both the funded status of our benefit plans and the calculation of fas pension expense in subsequent periods. although the actual return in any specific year likely will differ from the assumption, the average expected return over a long-term future horizon should be approximately equal to the assumption. any variance in a given year should not, by itself, suggest that the assumption should be changed. patterns of variances are reviewed over time, and then combined with expectations for the future. as a result, changes in this assumption are less frequent than changes in the discount rate.
in both october 2018 and 2017, the society of actuaries published revised longevity assumptions that refined its prior studies. we used the revised assumptions indicating a shortened longevity in our december 31, 2018 and december 31, 2017 re-measurements of benefit obligation. the publications were a refinement to assumptions the society of actuaries published in previous years, beginning in 2014.

our stockholders' equity has been reduced cumulatively by $14.3 billion from the annual year-end measurements of the funded status of postretirement benefit plans. the cumulative non-cash, after-tax reduction primarily represents net actuarial losses resulting from declines in discount rates, investment losses and updated longevity. a market-related value of our plan assets, determined using actual asset gains or losses over the prior three year period, is used to calculate the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. these cumulative actuarial losses will be amortized to expense using the corridor method, where gains and losses are recognized to the extent they exceed 10% of the greater of plan assets or benefit obligations, over the average future service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans of approximately nine years as of december 31, 2018. this amortization period is expected to extend (approximately double) in 2020 when our non-union pension plans are completely frozen to use the average remaining life expectancy of the participants instead of average future service. during 2018, $1.2 billion of these amounts was recognized as a component of postretirement benefit plans expense and about $908 million is expected to be recognized as expense in 2019.
the discount rate and long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions we select at the end of each year are based on our best estimates and judgment. a change of plus or minus 25 basis points in the 4.250% discount rate assumption at december 31, 2018, with all other assumptions held constant, would have decreased or increased the amount of the qualified pension benefit obligation we recorded at the end of 2018 by approximately $1.4 billion, which would result in an after-tax increase or decrease in stockholders' equity at the end of the year of approximately $1.1 billion. if the 4.250% discount rate at december 31, 2018 that was used to compute the expected 2019 fas pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of fas pension expense projected for 2019 would be lower or higher by approximately $120 million. if the 7.00% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption at december 31, 2018 that was used to compute the expected 2019 fas pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of fas pension expense projected for 2019 would be lower or higher by approximately $85 million. each year, differences between the actual plan asset return and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets impacts the measurement of the following year's fas expense. every 100 basis points difference in return during 2018 between our negative actual rate of return of approximately 5.00% and our expected long-term rate of return of 7.50% impacted 2019 expected fas pension expense by approximately $20 million.
funding considerations we made contributions of $5.0 billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2018. there were no material contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2017 and 2016. funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in a manner consistent with cas and in accordance with the employee retirement income security act of 1974 (erisa), as amended by the pension protection act of 2006 (ppa).
contributions to our defined benefit pension plans are recovered over time through the pricing of our products and services on u.s. government contracts, including fms, and are recognized in our cost of sales and net sales. cas govern the extent to which our pension costs are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the u.s. government, including fms. we recovered $2.4 billion in 2018, $2.2 billion in 2017, and $2.0 billion in 2016 as cas pension costs. effective february 27, 2012 and fully transitioned to in 2017, the cas rules were revised to better align the recovery of pension costs, including prepayment credits, on u.s. government contracts with the minimum funding requirements of the ppa (referred to as cas harmonization).
pension cost recoveries under cas occur in different periods from when pension contributions are made under the ppa. amounts contributed in excess of the cas pension costs recovered under u.s. government contracts are considered to be prepayment credits under the cas rules. as of december 31, 2018, our prepayment credits were approximately $8.5 billion as compared to $6.3 billion at december 31, 2017. the increase was due to our cash contributions of $5.0 billion in 2018 compared to our $2.4 billion in cas recoveries. cash contributions in excess of the recovery of cas pension costs under u.s. government contracts increases the prepayment credit balance. the prepayment credit balance will also increase or decrease based on our actual investment return on plan assets.
trends we made contributions of $5.0 billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2018, including required and discretionary contributions. as a result of these contributions, we do not expect to make contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2019. we anticipate recovering approximately $2.6 billion of cas pension cost in 2019 allowing us to recuperate a portion of our cas prepayment credits.
we expect our 2019 fas pension expense to be $1.1 billion; compared to our 2018 fas pension expense of $1.4 billion. the impact of the higher fas discount rate of 4.25% for 2019 versus 3.625% for 2018 was partly offset by our negative actual rate of investment return in 2018 of approximately 5.00% versus our expected long-term rate of return of 7.50%. we expect a fas/cas
52
pension benefit in 2019 of about $1.5 billion, as compared to $1.0 billion in 2018, due to the lower 2019 fas pension expense and higher 2019 cas pension cost as compared to 2018.
environmental matters we are a party to various agreements, proceedings and potential proceedings for environmental remediation issues, including matters at various sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party (prp). at december 31, 2018 and 2017, the total amount of liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet for environmental matters was $864 million and $920 million. we have recorded receivables totaling $750 million and $799 million at december 31, 2018 and 2017 for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our products and services for agencies of the u.s. government, as discussed below. the amount that is expected to be allocated to our non-u.s. government contracts or that is determined to not be recoverable under u.s. government contracts has been expensed through cost of sales. we project costs and recovery of costs over approximately 20 years.
we enter into agreements (e.g., administrative consent orders, consent decrees) that document the extent and timing of some of our environmental remediation obligations. we also are involved in environmental remediation activities at sites where formal agreements either do not exist or do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligations. environmental remediation activities usually span many years, which makes estimating the costs more judgmental due to, for example, changing remediation technologies. to determine the costs related to clean up sites, we have to assess the extent of contamination, effects on natural resources, the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation, and evolving environmental standards.
we perform quarterly reviews of environmental remediation sites and record liabilities and receivables in the period it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated (see the discussion under "environmental matters" in "note 1 - significant accounting policies" and "note 14 - legal proceedings, commitments and contingencies" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements). we consider the above factors in our quarterly estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for environmental remediation activities, which results in the calculation of a range of estimates for a particular environmental remediation site. we do not discount the recorded liabilities, as the amount and timing of future cash payments are not fixed or cannot be reliably determined. given the required level of judgment and estimation, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change (e.g., a change in environmental standards or a change in our estimate of the extent of contamination).
under agreements reached with the u.s. government, most of the amounts we spend for environmental remediation are allocated to our operations as general and administrative costs. under existing u.s. government regulations, these and other environmental expenditures relating to our u.s. government business, after deducting any recoveries received from insurance or other prps, are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services. as a result, most of the expenditures we incur are included in our net sales and cost of sales according to u.s. government agreement or regulation, regardless of the contract form (e.g. cost-reimbursable, fixed-price). we continually evaluate the recoverability of our environmental receivables by assessing, among other factors, u.s. government regulations, our u.s. government business base and contract mix, our history of receiving reimbursement of such costs, and recent efforts by some u.s. government representatives to limit such reimbursement.
in addition to the proceedings and potential proceedings discussed above, california previously established a maximum level of the contaminant hexavalent chromium in drinking water of 10 parts per billion (ppb). this standard was successfully challenged by the california manufacturers and technology association (cmta) for failure to conduct the required economic feasibility analysis. in response to the court's ruling, the state water resources control board (state board), a branch of the california environmental protection agency, withdrew the hexavalent chromium standard from the published regulations, leaving only the 50 ppb standard for total chromium. the state board has indicated it will work to re-establish a hexavalent chromium standard. if the standard for hexavalent chromium is re‐established at 10 ppb or above, it will not have a material impact on our existing environmental remediation costs in california. further, the u.s. environmental protection agency (u.s. epa) is considering whether to regulate hexavalent chromium.
california is also reevaluating its existing drinking water standard of 6 ppb for perchlorate, and the u.s. epa is taking steps to regulate perchlorate in drinking water. if substantially lower standards are adopted, in either california or at the federal level for perchlorate or for hexavalent chromium, we expect a material increase in our estimates for environmental liabilities and the related assets for the portion of the increased costs that are probable of future recovery in the pricing of our products and services for the u.s. government. the amount that would be allocable to our non-u.s. government contracts or that is determined not to be recoverable under u.s. government contracts would be expensed, which may have a material effect on our earnings in any particular interim reporting period.
as disclosed above, we may record changes in the amount of environmental remediation liabilities as a result of our quarterly reviews of the status of our environmental remediation sites, which would result in a change to the corresponding environmental
53
remediation receivables and a charge to earnings. for example, if we were to determine that the liabilities should be increased by $100 million, the corresponding receivables would be increased by approximately $87 million, with the remainder recorded as a charge to earnings. this allocation is determined annually, based upon our existing and projected business activities with the u.s. government.
we cannot reasonably determine the extent of our financial exposure at all environmental remediation sites with which we are involved. there are a number of former operating facilities we are monitoring or investigating for potential future environmental remediation. in some cases, although a loss may be probable, it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the amount of any obligation for remediation activities because of uncertainties (e.g., assessing the extent of the contamination). during any particular quarter, such uncertainties may be resolved, allowing us to estimate and recognize the initial liability to remediate a particular former operating site. the amount of the liability could be material. upon recognition of the liability, a portion will be recognized as a receivable with the remainder charged to earnings, which may have a material effect in any particular interim reporting period.
if we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a prp, we expect that the actual costs of environmental remediation will be shared with other liable prps. generally, prps that are ultimately determined to be responsible parties are strictly liable for site remediation and usually agree among themselves to share, on an allocated basis, the costs and expenses for environmental investigation and remediation. under existing environmental laws, responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and, therefore, we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation. in the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation, the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of cost recovery or contribution from the other prps. the amounts we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental costs we have incurred through insurance or from other prps, which we are required to pursue by agreement and u.s. government regulation.
goodwill the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses.
our goodwill balance was $10.8 billion at december 31, 2018 and 2017. we perform an impairment test of our goodwill at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. such events or changes in circumstances may include a significant deterioration in overall economic conditions, changes in the business climate of our industry, a decline in our market capitalization, operating performance indicators, competition, reorganizations of our business, u.s. government budget restrictions or the disposal of all or a portion of a reporting unit. our goodwill has been allocated to and is tested for impairment at a level referred to as the reporting unit, which is our business segment level or a level below the business segment. the level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires us to determine whether the operations below the business segment constitute a self-sustaining business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results.
we may use both qualitative and quantitative approaches when testing goodwill for impairment. for selected reporting units where we use the qualitative approach, we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment. based on that qualitative evaluation, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further evaluation is necessary. otherwise we perform a quantitative impairment test. we perform quantitative tests for most reporting units at least once every three years. however, for certain reporting units we may perform a quantitative impairment test every year.
to perform the quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. if the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. we generally estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of a discounted cash flow (dcf) analysis and market-based valuation methodologies such as comparable public company trading values and values observed in recent business acquisitions. determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant comparable public company earnings multiples and relevant transaction multiples. the cash flows employed in the dcf analysis are based on our best estimate of future sales, earnings and cash flows after considering factors such as general market conditions, u.s. government budgets, existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, changes in working capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance. the discount rates utilized in the dcf analysis are based on the respective reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital, which takes into account the relative weights of each component of capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent
54
in future cash flows of the respective reporting unit. the carrying value of each reporting unit includes the assets and liabilities employed in its operations, goodwill and allocations of amounts held at the business segment and corporate levels.
in the fourth quarter of 2018, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting units. the results of that test indicated that for each of our reporting units, including sikorsky, no impairment existed. as of the date of our annual impairment test, the carrying value of our sikorsky reporting unit includes goodwill of $2.7 billion and exceeds its fair value by a margin of approximately 20%. the carrying value and fair value of our sikorsky reporting unit is closely aligned. therefore, any business deterioration, changes in timing of orders, contract cancellations or terminations, or negative changes in market factors could cause our sales, earnings and cash flows to decline below current projections. similarly, market factors utilized in the impairment analysis, including long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant comparable public company earnings multiples and transaction multiples, could negatively impact the fair value of our reporting units. based on our assessment of these circumstances, we have determined that goodwill at our sikorsky reporting unit is at risk for impairment should there be deterioration of projected cash flows, negative changes in market factors or a significant increase in the carrying value of the reporting unit.
impairment assessments inherently involve management judgments regarding a number of assumptions such as those described above. due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit's fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill, differences in assumptions could have a material effect on the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period.
intangible assets intangible assets from acquired businesses are recognized at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition and consist of customer programs, trademarks, customer relationships, technology and other intangible assets. customer programs include values assigned to major programs of acquired businesses and represent the aggregate value associated with the customer relationships, contracts, technology and trademarks underlying the associated program and are amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value, which ranges from nine to 20 years. acquired intangibles deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual impairment testing. this testing compares carrying value to fair value and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. finite-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over the applicable useful lives, ranging from three to 20 years, based on the nature of the asset and the underlying pattern of economic benefit as reflected by future net cash inflows. we perform an impairment test of finite-lived intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may be impaired. should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a finite-lived intangible may be impaired, the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group would be compared to the asset group's carrying value. should the asset group's carrying amount exceed the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows, we would determine the fair value of the asset group and record an impairment loss in net earnings.
the carrying value of our sikorsky business includes an indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset of $887 million as of december 31, 2018. in the fourth quarter of 2018, we performed the annual impairment test for the sikorsky indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset and the results indicated that no impairment existed. as of the date of our annual impairment test, the sikorsky trademark exceeded its carrying value by a margin of approximately 5%. additionally, our sikorsky business has finite-lived customer program intangible assets with carrying values of $2.4 billion as of december 31, 2018. any business deterioration, contract cancellations or terminations, or negative changes in market factors could cause our sales to decline below current projections. based on our assessment of these circumstances, we have determined that our sikorsky intangible assets are at risk for impairment should there be any business deterioration, contract cancellations or terminations, or negative changes in market factors.
recent accounting pronouncements see "note 1 - significant accounting policies" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements (under the caption "recent accounting pronouncements").
55
item  7a.    quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain active relationships with a broad and diverse group of u.s. and international financial institutions. we believe that they provide us with sufficient access to the general and trade credit we require to conduct our business. we continue to closely monitor the financial market environment and actively manage counterparty exposure to minimize the potential impact from adverse developments with any single credit provider while ensuring availability of, and access to, sufficient credit resources.
our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market prices on certain equity securities. our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed-rate long-term debt and commercial paper. the estimated fair value of our outstanding debt was $15.4 billion at december 31, 2018 and the outstanding principal amount was $15.3 billion, excluding unamortized discounts and issuance costs of $1.2 billion. a 10% change in the level of interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our outstanding debt at december 31, 2018.
we use derivative instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. we do not enter into or hold derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. we transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates. we enter into foreign currency hedges such as forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change. our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the british pound sterling, the euro, the canadian dollar and the australian dollar. these contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. as a result, we do not have material foreign currency exposure, including exposure to the pound sterling or euro should there be material foreign currency fluctuations due to the united kingdom departing from the european union (commonly referred to as brexit). we designate foreign currency hedges as cash flow hedges. we also are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our borrowing activities. for fixed rate borrowings, we may use variable interest rate swaps, effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings indexed to libor in order to reduce the amount of interest paid. these swaps are designated as fair value hedges. for variable rate borrowings, we may use fixed interest rate swaps, effectively converting variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings in order to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on earnings. these swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. we also may enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting, which are intended to mitigate certain economic exposures.
the classification of gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of derivatives is dependent on our intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation. adjustments to reflect changes in fair values of derivatives attributable to the effective portion of hedges are either reflected in earnings and largely offset by corresponding adjustments to the hedged items or reflected net of income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are attributable to the ineffective portion of the hedges, or of derivatives that are not considered to be highly effective hedges, if any, are immediately recognized in earnings. the aggregate notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swaps at december 31, 2018 and 2017 was $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion. the aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedges at december 31, 2018 and 2017 was $3.5 billion and $4.1 billion. at december 31, 2018 and 2017, the net fair value of our derivative instruments was not material (see "note 16 - fair value measurements" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements). a 10% unfavorable exchange rate movement of our foreign currency contracts would not have a material impact on the aggregate net fair value of such contracts or our consolidated financial statements. additionally, as we enter into foreign currency contract to hedge foreign currency exposure on underlying transactions we believe that any movement on our foreign currency contracts would be offset by movement on the underlying transactions and, therefore, when taken together do not create material risk.
we evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into agreements with those deemed to have acceptable credit risk at the time the agreements are executed. our foreign currency exchange hedge portfolio is diversified across several banks. we periodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties. we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
we maintain a separate trust that includes investments to fund certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. as of december 31, 2018, investments in the trust totaled $1.3 billion and are reflected at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet in other noncurrent assets. the trust holds investments in marketable equity securities and fixed-income securities that are exposed to price changes and changes in interest rates. a portion of the liabilities associated with the deferred compensation plans supported by the trust is also impacted by changes in the market price of our common stock and certain market indices. changes in the value of the liabilities have the effect of partially offsetting the impact of changes in the value of the trust. both the change in the fair value of the trust and the change in the value of the liabilities are recognized on our consolidated statements of earnings in other unallocated, net and were not material for the year ended december 31, 2018.

item 8.     financial statements and supplementary data report of independent registered public accounting firm on the audited consolidated financial statements board of directors and stockholders lockheed martin corporation opinion on the financial statements we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of lockheed martin corporation (the corporation) as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2018, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the corporation at december 31, 2018 and 2017, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2018, in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.
we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob), the corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2018, based on criteria established in internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (2013 framework) and our report dated february 8, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
adoption of accounting standards update (asu) no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606)
as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the corporation changed its method for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers in the consolidated financial statements due to the adoption of asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606), as amended, using the full retrospective adoption method.
basis for opinion these financial statements are the responsibility of the corporation's management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the corporation's financial statements based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the corporation in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

lockheed martin corporation notes to consolidated financial statements note 1 - significant accounting policies organization - we are a global security and aerospace company principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. we also provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistics, system integration and cybersecurity services. we serve both u.s. and international customers with products and services that have defense, civil and commercial applications, with our principal customers being agencies of the u.s. government.
basis of presentation - our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of subsidiaries we control and variable interest entities if we are the primary beneficiary. we eliminate intercompany balances and transactions in consolidation. our receivables, inventories, customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred and certain amounts in other current liabilities primarily are attributable to long-term contracts or programs in progress for which the related operating cycles are longer than one year. in accordance with industry practice, we include these items in current assets and current liabilities. unless otherwise noted, we present all per share amounts cited in these consolidated financial statements on a "per diluted share" basis. certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation. the discussion and presentation of the operating results of our business segments have been impacted by the following recent events.
effective january 1, 2018, we adopted accounting standards update (asu) 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606), as amended (commonly referred to as asc 606), which changed the way we recognize revenue for certain contracts and significantly expanded disclosures about revenue recognition. in addition, effective january 1, 2018, we adopted asu 2017-07, compensation-retirement benefits (715): improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost, which changed the statement of earnings presentation of certain components of pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense. the amounts for all periods presented in this form 10-k have been adjusted to reflect these new methods of accounting.
on august 16, 2016, we completed the divestiture of the information systems & global solutions (is&gs) business, which merged with a subsidiary of leidos holdings, inc. (leidos) in a reverse morris trust transaction. accordingly, the operating results of the is&gs business have been classified as discontinued operations on our consolidated statements of earnings for all prior periods presented. however, the 2016 cash flows of the is&gs business have not been reclassified in our consolidated statements of cash flows as we retained the cash as part of the transaction. see "note 3 - acquisition and divestitures" for additional information about the divestiture of the is&gs business.
on august 24, 2016, we increased our ownership interest in the awe management limited (awe) joint venture, which operates the united kingdom's nuclear deterrent program, from 33% to 51%. consequently, we began consolidating awe and our operating results include 100% of awe's sales and 51% of its operating profit. prior to increasing our ownership interest, we accounted for our investment in awe using the equity method of accounting. under the equity method, we recognized only 33% of awe's earnings or losses and no sales. accordingly, prior to august 24, 2016, the date we obtained control, we recorded 33% of awe's net earnings in our operating results and subsequent to august 24, 2016, we recognized 100% of awe's sales and 51% of its operating profit. see "note 3 - acquisition and divestitures" for additional information about the change in ownership of awe.
use of estimates - we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). in doing so, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. our actual results may differ materially from these estimates. significant estimates inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, accounting for sales and cost recognition, postretirement benefit plans, environmental receivables and liabilities, evaluation of goodwill and other assets for impairment, income taxes including deferred income taxes, fair value measurements and contingencies.
revenue recognition - the majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the u.s. government and international customers (including foreign military sales (fms) contracted through the u.s. government) for the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. we provide our products and services under fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts.
63
under fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. to the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. some fixed-price contracts have a performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance.
cost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. typically, we enter into three types of cost-reimbursable contracts: cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-plus-fixed-fee. cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within specified limits based on the customer's assessment of our performance against a predetermined set of criteria, such as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee, which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (i.e., incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (i.e., incentive based on performance). the fixed-fee in a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is negotiated at the inception of the contract and that fixed-fee does not vary with actual costs.
we account for a contract after it has been approved by all parties to the arrangement, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable.
we assess each contract at its inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contracts. when making this determination, we consider factors such as whether two or more contracts were negotiated and executed at or near the same time or were negotiated with an overall profit objective. if combined, we treat the combined contracts as a single contract for revenue recognition purposes.
we evaluate the products or services promised in each contract at inception to determine whether the contract should be accounted for as having one or more performance obligations. the products and services in our contracts are typically not distinct from one another due to their complex relationships and the significant contract management functions required to perform under the contract. accordingly, our contracts are typically accounted for as one performance obligation. in limited cases, our contracts have more than one distinct performance obligation, which occurs when we perform activities that are not highly complex or interrelated or involve different product lifecycles. significant judgment is required in determining performance obligations, and these decisions could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in a given period. we classify net sales as products or services on our consolidated statements of earnings based on the predominant attributes of the performance obligations.
we determine the transaction price for each contract based on the consideration we expect to receive for the products or services being provided under the contract. for contracts where a portion of the price may vary we estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount, which is included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. we analyze the risk of a significant revenue reversal and if necessary constrain the amount of variable consideration recognized in order to mitigate this risk.
at the inception of a contract we estimate the transaction price based on our current rights and do not contemplate future modifications (including unexercised options) or follow-on contracts until they become legally enforceable. contracts are often subsequently modified to include changes in specifications, requirements or price, which may create new or change existing enforceable rights and obligations. depending on the nature of the modification, we consider whether to account for the modification as an adjustment to the existing contract or as a separate contract. generally, modifications to our contracts are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration and interrelated tasks provided in the context of the contract. therefore, such modifications are accounted for as if they were part of the existing contract and recognized as a cumulative adjustment to revenue.
for contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated standalone selling price of the product or service underlying each performance obligation. the standalone selling price represents the amount we would sell the product or service to a customer on a standalone basis (i.e., not bundled with any other products or services). our contracts with the u.s. government, including fms contracts, are subject to the federal acquisition regulations (far) and the price is typically based on estimated or actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin. as a result of these regulations, the standalone selling price of products or services in our contracts with the u.s. government and fms contracts are typically equal to the selling price stated in the contract.
for non-u.s. government contracts with multiple performance obligations, we evaluate whether the stated selling prices for the products or services represent their standalone selling prices. we primarily sell customized solutions unique to a customer's specifications. when it is necessary to allocate the transaction price to multiple performance obligations, we typically use the expected cost plus a reasonable profit margin to estimate the standalone selling price of each product or service. we occasionally
64
sell standard products or services with observable standalone sales transactions. in these situations, the observable standalone sales transactions are used to determine the standalone selling price.
we recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. in determining when performance obligations are satisfied, we consider factors such as contract terms, payment terms and whether there is an alternative future use of the product or service. substantially all of our revenue is recognized over time as we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfers continuously to the customer. for contracts with the u.s. government and fms contracts, this continuous transfer of control of the work in process to the customer is supported by clauses in the contract that allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience, pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit, and take possession of any work in process. our non-u.s. government contracts, primarily international direct commercial contracts, typically do not include termination for convenience provisions. however, continuous transfer of control to our customer is supported and, if our customer were to terminate the contract for reasons other than our non-performance, we would have the right to recover damages which would include, among other potential damages, the right to payment for our work performed to date plus a reasonable profit to deliver products or services that do not have an alternative use to us.
for performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts. under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the performance obligation(s). for performance obligations to provide services to the customer, revenue is recognized over time based on costs incurred or the right to invoice method (in situations where the value transferred matches our billing rights) as our customer receives and consumes the benefits.
for performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied. this coincides with the point in time the customer obtains control of the product or service, which typically occurs upon customer acceptance or receipt of the product or service, given that we maintain control of the product or service until that point.
backlog (i.e., unfulfilled or remaining performance obligations) represents the sales we expect to recognize for our products and services for which control has not yet transferred to the customer. for our cost-reimbursable and fixed-priced-incentive contracts, the estimated consideration we expect to receive pursuant to the terms of the contract may exceed the contractual award amount. the estimated consideration is determined at the outset of the contract and is continuously reviewed throughout the contract period. in determining the estimated consideration, we consider the risks related to the technical, schedule and cost impacts to complete the contract and an estimate of any variable consideration. periodically, we review these risks and may increase or decrease backlog accordingly. as the risks on such contracts are successfully retired, the estimated consideration from customers may be reduced, resulting in a reduction of backlog without a corresponding recognition of sales. as of december 31, 2018, our ending backlog was $130.5 billion. we expect to recognize approximately 38% of our backlog over the next 12 months and approximately 66% over the next 24 months as revenue, with the remainder recognized thereafter.
for arrangements with the u.s. government and fms contracts, we generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the customer. billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including the contract type. typical payment terms under fixed-price contracts with the u.s. government provide that the customer pays either performance-based payments (pbps) based on the achievement of contract milestones or progress payments based on a percentage of costs we incur. for the majority of our international direct commercial contracts to deliver complex systems, we typically receive advance payments prior to commencement of work, as well as milestone payments that are paid in accordance with the terms of our contract as we perform. we recognize a liability for payments in excess of revenue recognized, which is presented as a contract liability on the balance sheet. the portion of payments retained by the customer until final contract settlement is not considered a significant financing component because the intent is to protect the customer from our failure to adequately complete some or all of the obligations under the contract. payments received from customers in advance of revenue recognition are not considered to be significant financing components because they are used to meet working capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract.
for fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts, we present revenues recognized in excess of billings as contract assets on the balance sheet. amounts billed and due from our customers under both contract types are classified as receivables on the balance sheet.
significant estimates and assumptions are made in estimating contract sales and costs, including the profit booking rate. at the outset of a long-term contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, as well as variable consideration, and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of sales and total costs to
65
complete the contract. the estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead, general and administrative and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset or localization agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers). the initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract or may increase the variable consideration we expect to receive on the contract. conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase or our estimates of variable consideration we expect to receive decrease. all of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of the transaction price, a provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.
comparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method to measure progress towards completion. increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate. increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions, which are excluded from segment operating results; reserves for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets.
our consolidated net adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other items, increased segment operating profit by approximately $1.9 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.4 billion in 2018, 2017 and 2016. these adjustments increased net earnings by approximately $1.5 billion ($5.23 per share), $1.1 billion ($3.79 per share), and $910 million ($3.00 per share) in 2018, 2017 and 2016. we recognized net sales from performance obligations satisfied in prior periods of approximately $2.0 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.4 billion in 2018, 2017 and 2016, which primarily relate to changes in profit booking rates that impacted revenue.
as previously disclosed, we have a program, eadge-t, to design, integrate, and install an air missile defense command, control, communications, computers - intelligence (c4i) system for an international customer that has experienced performance matters and for which we have periodically accrued reserves. in 2017, we revised our estimated costs to complete the eadge-t contract as a consequence of ongoing performance matters and recorded an additional charge of $120 million ($74 million or $0.25 per share, after tax) at our rotary and mission systems (rms) business segment, which resulted in cumulative losses of approximately $260 million on this program. as of december 31, 2018, cumulative losses remained at approximately $260 million. we continue to monitor program requirements and our performance. at this time, we do not anticipate additional charges that would be material to our operating results or financial condition.
we have two commercial satellite programs, for the delivery of three satellites in total, to international customers at our space business segment, for which we have experienced performance issues related to the development and integration of a modernized lm 2100 satellite platform. these programs require the development of new satellite technology to enhance the lm 2100's power, propulsion and electronics, among other items. the enhanced lm 2100 satellite platform is expected to benefit other commercial and government satellite programs. we have periodically revised our estimated costs to complete these developmental commercial programs. we have recorded cumulative losses of approximately $380 million through december 31, 2018. in 2018, we recorded losses of approximately $75 million ($56 million, or $0.20 per share, after tax). while these losses reflect our estimated total losses on the programs, we will continue to incur general and administrative costs each period until we complete these programs. these programs remain developmental and further challenges in the delivery and integration of new satellite technology, anomalies discovered during system testing requiring repair or rework, further schedule delays and potential penalties could require that we record additional loss reserves which could be material to our operating results. we previously disclosed that, as we did not meet the july 2018 delivery requirement for two satellites, the customer could seek to exercise termination rights. one of the satellites has now been launched, eliminating this risk. as the other is expected to launch in the first half of 2019, we believe it unlikely that the customer will seek to do so. were the customer to seek to exercise a termination right and be successful in this effort, we would have to refund the payments we have received and pay certain penalties. on the third satellite, we currently anticipate delivery before the date upon which the customer could seek to exercise a termination right although we may have to pay certain penalties and have sought to address this possibility in our reserves.
66
we are responsible for designing, developing and installing an upgraded turret for the warrior capability sustainment program. in 2018, we revised our estimated costs to complete the program as a consequence of performance issues, and recorded a charge of approximately $85 million ($64 million, or $0.22 per share, after tax) at our missiles and fire control (mfc) business segment, which resulted in cumulative losses of approximately $140 million on this program as of december 31, 2018. we may continue to experience issues related to customer requirements and our performance under this contract and have to record additional charges. however, based on the losses already recorded and our current estimate of the sales and costs to complete the program, at this time we do not anticipate that additional losses, if any, would be material to our operating results or financial condition.
research and development and similar costs - we conduct research and development (r&d) activities using our own funds (referred to as company-funded r&d or independent research and development (ir&d)) and under contractual arrangements with our customers (referred to as customer-funded r&d) to enhance existing products and services and to develop future technologies. r&d costs include basic research, applied research, concept formulation studies, design, development, and related test activities. company-funded r&d costs are allocated to customer contracts as part of the general and administrative overhead costs and generally recoverable on our customer contracts with the u.s. government. customer-funded r&d costs are charged directly to the related customer contract. substantially all r&d costs are charged to cost of sales as incurred. company-funded r&d costs charged to cost of sales totaled $1.3 billion in 2018, $1.2 billion in 2017 and $988 million in 2016.
stock-based compensation - compensation cost related to all share-based payments is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award. we generally recognize the compensation cost ratably over a three-year vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures. at each reporting date, the number of shares is adjusted to the number ultimately expected to vest.
income taxes - we calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as from operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid.
we periodically assess our tax exposures related to periods that are open to examination. based on the latest available information, we evaluate our tax positions to determine whether the position will more likely than not be sustained upon examination by the internal revenue service (irs) or other taxing authorities. if we cannot reach a more-likely-than-not determination, no benefit is recorded. if we determine that the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, we record the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized when the tax position is settled. we record interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of income tax expense on our consolidated statements of earnings. interest and penalties were not material.
cash and cash equivalents - cash equivalents include highly liquid instruments with original maturities of 90 days or less.
receivables - receivables, net represent our unconditional right to consideration under the contract and include amounts billed and currently due from customers. the amounts are stated at their net estimated realizable value. there were no significant impairment losses related to our receivables in 2018, 2017, or 2016.
on occasion, our customers may seek deferred payment terms to purchase our products. in connection with these transactions, we may, at our customer's request, enter into arrangements for the non-recourse sale of customer receivables to unrelated third-party financial institutions. for accounting purposes, these transactions are not discounted and are treated as a sale of receivables as we have no continuing involvement. the sale proceeds from the financial institutions are reflected in our operating cash flows on the statement of cash flows. we sold approximately $532 million in 2018 and $698 million in 2017 of customer receivables. there were no gains or losses related to sales of these receivables.
contract assets - contract assets include unbilled amounts typically resulting from sales under contracts when the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method of revenue recognition is utilized and revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer. the amounts may not exceed their estimated net realizable value. contract assets are classified as current based on our contract operating cycle.
inventories - we record inventories at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the utility of our inventories have diminished through damage, deterioration, obsolescence, changes in price or other causes, a loss is recognized in the period in which it occurs. we capitalize labor, material, subcontractor and overhead costs as work-in-process for contracts where control has not yet passed to the customer. in addition, we capitalize costs incurred to fulfill a contract in advance of contract award in inventories as work-in-process if we determine that contract award is probable. we determine the costs of other product and supply inventories by using the first-in first-out or average cost methods.
67
contract liabilities - contract liabilities (formerly referred to as customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred) include advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized. contract liabilities are classified as current based on our contract operating cycle and reported on a contract-by-contract basis, net of revenue recognized, at the end of each reporting period.
property, plant and equipment - we record property, plant and equipment at cost. we provide for depreciation and amortization on plant and equipment generally using accelerated methods during the first half of the estimated useful lives of the assets and the straight-line method thereafter. the estimated useful lives of our plant and equipment generally range from 10 to 40 years for buildings and five to 15 years for machinery and equipment. no depreciation expense is recorded on construction in progress until such assets are placed into operation. depreciation expense related to plant and equipment was $759 million in 2018, $760 million in 2017, and $747 million in 2016.
we review the carrying amounts of long-lived assets for impairment if events or changes in the facts and circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. we assess impairment by comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the related asset grouping to its carrying amount. if an asset is determined to be impaired, we recognize an impairment charge in the current period for the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount.
capitalized software - we capitalize certain costs associated with the development or purchase of internal-use software. the amounts capitalized are included in other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the resulting software, which ranges from two to six years. as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, capitalized software totaled $447 million and $424 million, net of accumulated amortization of $2.1 billion and $2.0 billion. no amortization expense is recorded until the software is ready for its intended use. amortization expense related to capitalized software was $106 million in 2018, $123 million in 2017 and $136 million in 2016.
goodwill - the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses.
our goodwill balance was $10.8 billion at both december 31, 2018 and 2017. we perform an impairment test of our goodwill at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. such events or changes in circumstances may include a significant deterioration in overall economic conditions, changes in the business climate of our industry, a decline in our market capitalization, operating performance indicators, competition, reorganizations of our business, u.s. government budget restrictions or the disposal of all or a portion of a reporting unit. our goodwill has been allocated to and is tested for impairment at a level referred to as the reporting unit, which is our business segment level or a level below the business segment. the level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires us to determine whether the operations below the business segment constitute a self-sustaining business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results.
we may use either a qualitative or quantitative approach when testing a reporting unit's goodwill for impairment. for selected reporting units where we use the qualitative approach, we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment. based on that qualitative evaluation, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further evaluation is necessary. otherwise we perform a quantitative impairment test. we perform quantitative tests for most reporting units at least once every three years. however, for certain reporting units we may perform a quantitative impairment test every year.
for the quantitative impairment test we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. if the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. we generally estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of a discounted cash flow (dcf) analysis and market-based valuation methodologies such as comparable public company trading values and values observed in recent business acquisitions. determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant comparable public company earnings multiples and relevant transaction multiples. the cash flows employed in the dcf analysis are based on our best estimate of future sales, earnings and cash flows after considering factors such as general market conditions, u.s. government budgets, existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, changes in working capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance. the discount rates utilized in the dcf analysis are based on the respective reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital, which takes into account the relative weights of each component of capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flows of the respective reporting unit. the carrying value of each reporting unit includes the assets and liabilities employed in its operations, goodwill and allocations of certain assets and liabilities held at the business segment and corporate levels.

during the fourth quarters of 2018, 2017 and 2016, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting units. the results of our annual impairment tests of goodwill indicated that no impairment existed.
intangible assets - intangible assets from acquired businesses are recognized at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition and consist of customer programs, trademarks, customer relationships, technology and other intangible assets. customer programs include values assigned to major programs of acquired businesses and represent the aggregate value associated with the customer relationships, contracts, technology and trademarks underlying the associated program and are amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value, which ranges from nine to 20 years. acquired intangibles deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual impairment testing. this testing compares carrying value to fair value and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. finite-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over the applicable useful lives, ranging from three to 20 years, based on the nature of the asset and the underlying pattern of economic benefit as reflected by future net cash inflows. we perform an impairment test of finite-lived intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may be impaired.
postretirement benefit plans - many of our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans and we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retirees (collectively, postretirement benefit plans). gaap requires that the amounts we record related to our postretirement benefit plans be computed, based on service to date, using actuarial valuations that are based in part on certain key economic assumptions we make, including the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions including participant longevity (also known as mortality), health care cost trend rates and employee turnover, each as appropriate based on the nature of the plans.
a market-related value of our plan assets, determined using actual asset gains or losses over the prior three year period, is used to calculate the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. these asset gains or losses, along with those resulting from adjustments to our benefit obligation, will be amortized to expense using the corridor method, where gains and losses are recognized to the extent they exceed 10% of the greater of plan assets or benefit obligations, over the average future service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans of approximately nine years as of december 31, 2018. this amortization period is expected to extend (approximately double) in 2020 when our non-union pension plan is frozen to use the average remaining life expectancy of the participants instead of average future service.
we recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans under gaap as either an asset recorded within other noncurrent assets or a liability recorded within noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. the gaap funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan's assets and the benefit obligation of the plan. the funded status under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 (erisa), as amended by the pension protection act of 2006 (ppa), is calculated on a different basis than under gaap.
environmental matters - we record a liability for environmental matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. the amount of liability recorded is based on our estimate of the costs to be incurred for remediation at a particular site. we do not discount the recorded liabilities, as the amount and timing of future cash payments are not fixed or cannot be reliably determined. our environmental liabilities are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets within other liabilities, both current and noncurrent. we expect to include a substantial portion of environmental costs in our net sales and cost of sales in future periods pursuant to u.s. government agreement or regulation. at the time a liability is recorded for future environmental costs, we record a receivable for estimated future recovery considered probable through the pricing of products and services to agencies of the u.s. government, regardless of the contract form (e.g., cost-reimbursable, fixed-price). we continuously evaluate the recoverability of our environmental receivables by assessing, among other factors, u.s. government regulations, our u.s. government business base and contract mix, our history of receiving reimbursement of such costs, and recent efforts by some u.s. government representatives to limit such reimbursement. we include the portion of those environmental costs expected to be allocated to our non-u.s. government contracts, or that is determined to not be recoverable under u.s. government contracts, in our cost of sales at the time the liability is established. our environmental receivables are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets within other assets, both current and noncurrent. we project costs and recovery of costs over approximately 20 years.
investments in marketable securities - investments in marketable securities consist of debt and equity securities which are recorded at fair value. as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, the fair value of our investments totaled $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion and was included in other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheets. our investments are held in a separate trust, which includes investments to fund our deferred compensation plan liabilities. net losses on these securities were $67 million in 2018 compared to net gains on these securities of $150 million in 2017 and $66 million in 2016. gains and losses on these investments are included in other unallocated, net within cost of sales on our consolidated statements of earnings in order to align the classification of changes in the market value of investments held for the plan with changes in the value of the corresponding plan liabilities.
69
equity method investments - investments where we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but do not control, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are included in other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheets. significant influence typically exists if we have a 20% to 50% ownership interest in the investee. under this method of accounting, our share of the net earnings or losses of the investee is included in operating profit in other income, net on our consolidated statements of earnings since the activities of the investee are closely aligned with the operations of the business segment holding the investment. we evaluate our equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such investments may be impaired. if a decline in the value of an equity method investment is determined to be other than temporary, a loss is recorded in earnings in the current period. as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, our equity method investments totaled $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion, which primarily are composed of our investment in the united launch alliance (ula) joint venture, and the advanced military maintenance, repair and overhaul center (ammroc) joint venture. our share of net earnings related to our equity method investees was $119 million in 2018, $207 million in 2017 and $443 million in 2016, of which approximately $210 million, $205 million and $325 million was included in our space business segment operating profit.
during the year ended december 31, 2018, equity earnings included a non-cash asset impairment charge of $110 million ($83 million, or $0.29 per share, after tax) related to our equity method investee, ammroc. during the year ended december 31, 2017, equity earnings included a charge recorded in the first quarter of 2017 of approximately $64 million ($40 million, or $0.14 per share, after tax), which represented our portion of a non-cash asset impairment related to certain long-lived assets held by ammroc. we are continuing to monitor this investment in light of ongoing performance, business base and economic issues and we may have to record our portion of additional charges, or an impairment of our investment, or both, should the carrying value of our investment exceed its fair value. these charges could adversely affect our results of operations.
derivative financial instruments - we use derivative instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. we do not enter into or hold derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. we transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates. we enter into foreign currency hedges such as forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change. these contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. we designate foreign currency hedges as cash flow hedges. we also are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our borrowing activities. for fixed rate borrowings, we may use variable interest rate swaps, effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings in order to reduce the amount of interest paid. these swaps are designated as fair value hedges. for variable rate borrowings, we may use fixed interest rate swaps, effectively converting variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings in order to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on earnings. these swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. we also may enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting, which are intended to mitigate certain economic exposures.
we record derivatives at their fair value. the classification of gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of derivatives is dependent on our intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation. adjustments to reflect changes in fair values of derivatives attributable to the effective portion of hedges are either reflected in earnings and largely offset by corresponding adjustments to the hedged items or reflected net of income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are attributable to the ineffective portion of the hedges or of derivatives that are not considered to be highly effective hedges, if any, are immediately recognized in earnings. the aggregate notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swaps at december 31, 2018 and 2017 was $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion. the aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedges at december 31, 2018 and 2017 was $3.5 billion and $4.1 billion. the fair values of our outstanding interest rate swaps and foreign currency hedges at december 31, 2018 and 2017 were not significant. derivative instruments did not have a material impact on net earnings and comprehensive income during the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. the impact of derivative instruments on our consolidated statements of cash flows is included in net cash provided by operating activities. substantially all of our derivatives are designated for hedge accounting. see "note 16 - fair value measurements" for more information on the fair value measurements related to our derivative instruments.
recent accounting pronouncements revenue from contracts with customers effective january 1, 2018, we adopted asc 606, which replaces existing revenue recognition guidance and outlines a single set of comprehensive principles for recognizing revenue under gaap. among other things, asc 606 requires entities to assess the products or services promised in contracts with customers at contract inception to determine the appropriate unit at which to record revenues, which is referred to as a performance obligation. revenue is recognized when control of the promised products or services is transferred to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in
70
exchange for those products or services. prior to the adoption of asc 606, we recognized the majority of our revenues using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. based on the nature of products provided or services performed, revenue was recorded as costs were incurred (the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method) or as units were delivered (the percentage-of-completion units-of-delivery method). for most of our contracts, the customer obtains control or receives benefits as we perform on the contract. as a result, under asc 606 revenue is recognized over time utilizing the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method. this change generally results in an acceleration of revenue for contracts that were historically accounted for using the percentage-of-completion units-of-delivery method as revenues are now recognized earlier in the performance period as we incur costs. for more information on our policy for recognizing revenue under asc 606, see "note 1 - significant accounting policies" significant programs impacted by these changes include the c-130j and c-5 programs in our aeronautics business segment; tactical missile programs (hellfire and joint air-to-surface standoff missile (jassm)), patriot advanced capability-3 (pac-3), and fire control programs (lantirn® and sniper®) in our mfc business segment; the black hawk® and seahawk® helicopter programs in our rms business segment; and commercial satellite programs in our space business segment.
we adopted asc 606 using the full retrospective method, which means we applied the new standard to each prior year presented in our financial statements going back to january 1, 2016, with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of january 1, 2016 for contracts that were in process at that point in time. accordingly, the amounts for all periods presented in this form 10‐k have been adjusted to reflect the impacts of asc 606.
compensation-retirement benefits effective january 1, 2018, we also adopted asu 2017-07, which changed the income statement presentation of certain components of net periodic benefit cost related to defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. asu 2017-07 requires entities to record only the service cost component of fas pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense in operating profit and the non-service cost components of fas pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense (i.e., interest cost, expected return on plan assets, net actuarial gains or losses, and amortization of prior service cost or credits) as part of non-operating expense. previously, we recorded all components of net periodic benefit cost in operating profit as part of cost of sales. we adopted asu 2017-07 using the retrospective method, which means we applied the new standard to each prior period presented in our financial statements going back to january 1, 2016.

income statement - reporting comprehensive income effective january 1, 2018, we also adopted asu 2018-02, income statement - reporting comprehensive income (topic 220): reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income, which provides entities an option to reclassify certain tax effects as a result of the tax act from accumulated other comprehensive income or loss to retained earnings. the adoption of asu 2018-02 increased our aocl at january 1, 2018 by $2.4 billion with a corresponding increase to retained earnings by the same amount with zero impact to total equity. the reclassification was primarily related to the impact of u.s. tax reform on deferred tax assets associated with net actuarial losses (and prior service credits) resulting from our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that were originally recorded in aocl within equity. those amounts were originally recorded net of deferred tax benefits based on the federal statutory income tax rate in effect at the time they were recorded. gaap requires entities to remeasure deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in tax laws or rates, with the impacts reflected in earnings. accordingly, in the fourth quarter of 2017, we remeasured the deferred tax assets associated with our aocl using the lower u.s. corporate income tax rate under the tax act, with the impacts of the remeasurement recorded as a one-time charge to earnings. prior to asu 2018-02, gaap required the original deferred tax amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, to remain at the old tax rate despite the fact that its related deferred tax asset or liability was remeasured as a result of the tax act. asu 2018-02 allows entities to record a one-time reclassification of these tax effects between accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and retained earnings. we reclassify the impact of the income tax effects of tax reform from aocl in the period in which they occur.
compensation-retirement benefits-defined benefit plans-general in august 2018, the fasb issued asu 2018-14, compensation-retirement benefits-defined benefit plans-general (topic 715-20): disclosure framework-changes to the disclosure requirements for defined benefit plans. the new standard modifies the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans by removing and adding certain disclosures for these plans. the effective date is our fiscal year ending december 31, 2020 with early adoption permitted and requires application on a retrospective basis. the adoption will not have a material effect on the company's consolidated financial statements derivatives and hedging in august 2017, the fasb issued asu no. 2017-12, derivatives and hedging (topic 815), which eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness. the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. we adopted the new standard on january 1, 2019. we do not expect a significant impact to our consolidated assets and liabilities, net earnings, or cash flows as a result of adopting this new standard.
leases in february 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-02, leases (topic 842), which requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for most lease arrangements and expands disclosures about leasing arrangements for both lessees and lessors, among other items. the new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2018, which makes the new standard effective for us on january 1, 2019. we may apply the transition provisions of asu 2016-02, as amended, either at the beginning of the earliest period presented in our fiscal year 2019 form 10-k, which would be january 1, 2017, or on the effective date of adoption, which would be january 1, 2019. among other requirements, the transition provisions require the lessee to recognize a right-of-use asset and liability for most existing lease arrangements on the date the transition provisions are applied. we have elected to apply the transition provisions of this new standard on january 1, 2019. therefore, periods prior to the effective date of adoption will continue to be reported using current gaap (asc 840).
we commenced our evaluation of the impact of the new lease accounting standard in late 2016 by evaluating its impact on selected contracts. with this baseline understanding, we developed a project plan to evaluate numerous contracts across our corporation, develop processes and tools to implement the new standard and identify and design changes to internal controls by january 1, 2019. we have successfully identified and classified our lease population and we continued to perform under this project plan through the end of 2018. the majority of our existing lease arrangements are classified as operating leases, which will continue to be classified as operating under the new standard. upon adoption of the new standard on january 1, 2019, we will record a right-of-use asset and lease liability, both with an approximate balance of $1.1 billion, on our balance sheet for all of our lease arrangements. we do not anticipate that adoption of the new standard will have a significant impact on our net earnings or cash flows.

note 2 - earnings per share the weighted average number of shares outstanding used to compute earnings per common share were as follows (in millions):
2018      2017      2016
weighted average common shares outstanding for basic computations       284.5     287.8     299.3
weighted average dilutive effect of equity awards                         2.3       2.8       3.8
weighted average common shares outstanding for diluted computations     286.8     290.6     303.1
we compute basic and diluted earnings per common share by dividing net earnings by the respective weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the periods presented. our calculation of diluted earnings per common share also includes the dilutive effects for the assumed vesting of outstanding restricted stock units (rsus), performance stock units (psus) and exercise of outstanding stock options based on the treasury stock method. there were no significant anti-dilutive equity awards for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.
note 3 - acquisition and divestitures consolidation of awe management limited on august 24, 2016, we increased our ownership interest in the awe joint venture, which operates the united kingdom's nuclear deterrent program, from 33% to 51%. consequently, we began consolidating awe and our operating results include 100% of awe's sales and 51% of its operating profit. prior to increasing our ownership interest, we accounted for our investment in awe using the equity method of accounting. under the equity method, we recognized only 33% of awe's earnings or losses and no sales. accordingly, prior to august 24, 2016, the date we obtained control, we recorded 33% of awe's net earnings in our operating results and subsequent to august 24, 2016, we recognized 100% of awe's sales and 51% of its operating profit.
we accounted for this transaction as a "step acquisition" (as defined by u.s. gaap), which requires us to consolidate and record the assets and liabilities of awe at fair value. accordingly, we recorded intangible assets of $243 million related to customer relationships, $32 million of net liabilities, and noncontrolling interests of $107 million. the intangible assets are being amortized over a period of eight years in accordance with the underlying pattern of economic benefit reflected by the future net cash flows. in 2016, we recognized a non-cash net gain of $104 million associated with obtaining a controlling interest in awe, which consisted of a $127 million pretax gain recognized in the operating results of our space business segment and $23 million of tax-related items at our corporate office. the gain represented the fair value of our 51% interest in awe, less the carrying value of our previously held investment in awe and deferred taxes. the gain was recorded in other income, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. the fair value of awe (including the intangible assets), our controlling interest, and the noncontrolling interests were determined using the income approach.
divestiture of the information systems & global solutions business on august 16, 2016, we divested our former is&gs business, which merged with leidos, in a reverse morris trust transaction (the "transaction"). the transaction was completed in a multi-step process pursuant to which we initially contributed the is&gs business to abacus innovations corporation (abacus), a wholly owned subsidiary of lockheed martin created to facilitate the transaction, and the common stock of abacus was distributed to participating lockheed martin stockholders through an exchange offer. under the terms of the exchange offer, lockheed martin stockholders had the option to exchange shares of lockheed martin common stock for shares of abacus common stock. at the conclusion of the exchange offer, all shares of abacus common stock were exchanged for 9,369,694 shares of lockheed martin common stock held by lockheed martin stockholders that elected to participate in the exchange. the shares of lockheed martin common stock that were exchanged and accepted were retired, reducing the number of shares of our common stock outstanding by approximately 3%. following the exchange offer, abacus merged with a subsidiary of leidos, with abacus continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of leidos. as part of the merger, each share of abacus common stock was automatically converted into one share of leidos common stock. we did not receive any shares of leidos common stock as part of the transaction and do not hold any shares of leidos or abacus common stock following the transaction. based on an opinion of outside tax counsel, subject to customary qualifications and based on factual representations, the exchange offer and merger will qualify as tax-free transactions to lockheed martin and its stockholders, except to the extent that cash was paid to lockheed martin stockholders in lieu of fractional shares.
in connection with the transaction, abacus borrowed an aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.84 billion under term loan facilities with third party financial institutions, the proceeds of which were used to make a one-time special cash payment of $1.80 billion to lockheed martin and to pay associated borrowing fees and expenses. the entire special cash payment was used to repay debt, pay dividends and repurchase stock during the third and fourth quarters of 2016. the obligations under the abacus term loan facilities were guaranteed by leidos as part of the transaction.
77
as a result of the transaction, we recognized a net gain of approximately $1.3 billion, including $1.2 billion recognized in 2016. the net gain represents the $2.5 billion fair value of the shares of lockheed martin common stock exchanged and retired as part of the exchange offer, plus the $1.8 billion one-time special cash payment, less the net book value of the is&gs business of about $3.0 billion at august 16, 2016 and other adjustments of about $100 million. in 2017, we recognized an additional gain of $73 million, which reflects certain post-closing adjustments, including certain tax adjustments and the final determination of net working capital.
we classified the operating results of our former is&gs business as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. gaap, as the divestiture of this business represented a strategic shift that had a major effect on our operations and financial results. however, the cash flows generated by the is&gs business have not been reclassified in our consolidated statements of cash flows as we retained this cash as part of the transaction.
the operating results, prior to the august 16, 2016 divestiture date, of the is&gs business that have been reflected within net earnings from discontinued operations for the year ended december 31, 2016 are as follows (in millions):
net sales                                                          $3,410
cost of sales                                                      (2,953   )

other income, net                                                      16
operating profit                                                      454
earnings from discontinued operations before income taxes             454
income tax expense                                                   (147   )
net gain on divestiture of discontinued operations                  1,205
net earnings from discontinued operations                          $1,512
the operating results of the is&gs business reported as discontinued operations are different than the results previously reported for the is&gs business segment. results reported within net earnings from discontinued operations only include costs that were directly attributable to the is&gs business and exclude certain corporate overhead costs that were previously allocated to the is&gs business. as a result, we reclassified $82 million in 2016 of corporate overhead costs from the is&gs business to other unallocated, net on our consolidated statement of earnings.
additionally, we retained all assets and obligations related to the pension benefits earned by former is&gs business salaried employees through the date of divestiture. therefore, the non-service portion of net pension costs (e.g., interest cost, actuarial gains and losses and expected return on plan assets) for these plans have been reclassified from the operating results of the is&gs business segment and reported as a reduction to the fas/cas pension adjustment. these net pension costs were $54 million for the year ended december 31, 2016. the service portion of net pension costs related to is&gs business's salaried employees that transferred to leidos were included in the operating results of the is&gs business classified as discontinued operations because such costs are no longer incurred by us.
significant severance charges related to the is&gs business were historically recorded at the lockheed martin corporate office. these charges have been reclassified into the operating results of the is&gs business, classified as discontinued operations, and excluded from the operating results of our continuing operations. the amount of severance charges reclassified were $19 million in 2016.
financial information related to cash flows generated by the is&gs business, such as depreciation and amortization, capital expenditures, and other non-cash items, included in our consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2016 were not significant.

acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense primarily on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives: customer programs, from nine to 20 years; customer relationships, from four to 10 years; and other intangibles, from three to 10 years.
amortization expense for acquired finite-lived intangible assets was $296 million, $312 million and $284 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016. estimated future amortization expense is as follows: $285 million in 2019; $263 million in 2020; $256 million in 2021; $253 million in 2022; $250 million in 2023 and $1.3 billion thereafter.
with the acquisition of sikorsky aircraft corporation (sikorsky), we recorded customer contractual obligations of $507 million. customer contractual obligations represent liabilities on certain development programs where the expected costs exceed the expected sales under contract. these liabilities are liquidated in accordance with the underlying economic pattern of the contractual obligations, as reflected by the estimated future net cash outflows incurred on the associated contracts. as of december 31, 2018, we have recognized approximately $325 million in net sales related to customer contractual obligations. as of december 31, 2018, the estimated liquidation of the customer contractual obligation is approximated as follows: $70 million in 2019, $45 million in 2020, $15 million in 2021, $30 million in 2022, $5 million in 2023 and $17 million thereafter.

note 5 - information on business segments we operate in four business segments: aeronautics, mfc, rms and space. we organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered. following is a brief description of the activities of our business segments:
•   aeronautics - engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies.
•   missiles and fire control - provides air and missile defense systems; tactical missiles and air-to-ground precision strike weapon systems; logistics; fire control systems; mission operations support, readiness, engineering support and integration services; manned and unmanned ground vehicles; and energy management solutions.
•   rotary and mission systems - provides design, manufacture, service and support for a variety of military and commercial helicopters; ship and submarine mission and combat systems; mission systems and sensors for rotary and fixed-wing aircraft; sea and land-based missile defense systems; radar systems; the littoral combat ship (lcs); simulation and training services; and unmanned systems and technologies. in addition, rms supports the needs of customers in cybersecurity and delivers communications and command and control capability through complex mission solutions for defense applications.
•   space - engaged in the research and development, design, engineering and production of satellites, space transportation systems, and strategic, advanced strike, and defensive systems. space provides network-enabled situational awareness and integrates complex space and ground global systems to help our customers gather, analyze and securely distribute critical intelligence data. space is also responsible for various classified systems and services in support of vital national security systems. prior to august 24, 2016, the date we obtained control of awe we accounted for the venture using the equity method of accounting with 33% of awe's earnings or losses recognized by space. subsequent to august 24, 2016, we obtained control of awe and 100% of awe's sales and 51% of awe's earnings have been included in our consolidated results of operations. accordingly, the consolidated results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2016 do not reflect a full year of awe operations. operating profit for our space business segment also includes our share of earnings for our investment in ula, which provides expendable launch services to the u.s. government.
the financial information in the following tables includes the results of businesses we have acquired from their respective dates of acquisition and excludes businesses included in discontinued operations (see "note 3 - acquisition and divestitures") for all years presented. net sales of our business segments exclude intersegment sales as these activities are eliminated in consolidation.
operating profit of our business segments includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees as the operating activities of the equity method investees are closely aligned with the operations of our business segments. ula, results of which are included in our space business segment, is our primary equity method investee. operating profit of our business segments excludes the fas/cas operating adjustment for our qualified defined benefit pension plans (described below); the adjustment from cas to fas service cost component for all other postretirement benefit plans; expense for stock-based compensation; the effects of items not considered part of management's evaluation of segment operating performance, such as charges related to significant severance and restructuring actions (see "note 15 - severance and restructuring charges") and goodwill impairments; gains or losses from significant divestitures; the effects of certain legal settlements; corporate costs not allocated to our business segments; and other miscellaneous corporate activities. these items are included in the reconciling item "unallocated items" between operating profit from our business segments and our consolidated operating profit. see "note 1 - significant accounting policies" (under the caption "use of estimates") for a discussion related to certain factors that may impact the comparability of net sales and operating profit of our business segments.
our business segments' results of operations include pension expense only as calculated under u.s. government cost accounting standards (cas), which we refer to as cas pension cost. we recover cas pension cost through the pricing of our products and services on u.s. government contracts and, therefore, the cas pension cost is recognized in each of our business segments' net sales and cost of sales. our consolidated operating profit in our consolidated financial statements must present the service cost component of fas pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense calculated in accordance with fas requirements under u.s. gaap. the operating portion of the net fas/cas operating adjustment represents the difference between the service cost component of fas pension expense and the cas pension cost recorded in our business segments' results of operations. the non-service fas pension and other postretirement benefit plan cost component is included in other non-operating expenses, net on our consolidated statement of earnings.

(a)   we record the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost as part of other non-operating expense, net in the consolidated statement of earnings. the non-service cost components in the table above relate only to our qualified defined benefit pension plans. we incurred total non-service costs for our qualified defined benefit pension plans in the table above, along with similar costs for our other postretirement benefit plans of $67 million, $109 million, and $123 million for the years ended 2018, 2017 and 2016.
we recover cas pension cost through the pricing of our products and services on u.s. government contracts and, therefore, recognize cas pension cost in each of our business segment's net sales and cost of sales. our consolidated financial statements must present fas pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense calculated in accordance with fas requirements under u.s. gaap. the operating portion of the net fas/cas pension adjustment represents the difference between the service cost component of fas pension expense and cas pension cost. the non-service fas pension cost component is included in other non-operating expense, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. the net fas/cas pension adjustment increases or decreases cas pension cost to equal total fas pension expense (both service and non-service).

contract assets are net of $30.2 billion and $19.9 billion of customer advances and progress payments as of december 31, 2018 and 2017. contract assets increased $1.5 billion during 2018, primarily due to the recognition of revenue related to the satisfaction or partial satisfaction of performance obligations during 2018 for which we have not yet billed. there were no significant impairment losses related to our contract assets during 2018 and 2017. we expect to bill our customers for the majority of the december 31, 2018 contract assets during 2019.
contract liabilities decreased $537 million during 2018, primarily due to revenue recognized in excess of payments received on these performance obligations. during 2018, we recognized $3.9 billion of our contract liabilities at december 31, 2018 as revenue. during 2017, we recognized $3.3 billion of our contract liabilities at december 31, 2017 as revenue. during 2016, we recognized $3.7 billion of our contract liabilities at december 31, 2016 as revenue.

work-in-process inventories at december 31, 2018 and 2017 included general and administrative costs of $53 million and $112 million. general and administrative costs incurred and recorded in inventories totaled $1.9 billion in 2018, $2.0 billion in 2017 and $1.9 billion in 2016. general and administrative costs charged to cost of sales from inventories totaled $2.0 billion in both 2018 and 2017 and $1.9 billion in 2016.
costs incurred to fulfill a contract in advance of the contract being awarded are included in inventories as work-in-process if we determine that those costs relate directly to a contract or to an anticipated contract that we can specifically identify and contract award is probable, the costs generate or enhance resources that will be used in satisfying performance obligations, and the costs are recoverable (referred to as pre-contract costs). pre-contract costs that are initially capitalized in inventory are generally recognized as cost of sales consistent with the transfer of products and services to the customer upon the receipt of the anticipated contract. all other pre-contract costs, including start-up costs, are expensed as incurred. as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, $443 million and $466 million of pre-contract costs were included in inventories.

(a)   represents one-time charge in 2017 primarily due to the re-measurement of certain net deferred tax assets using the lower u.s. corporate income tax rate and a deemed repatriation tax, and true-up to this charge in 2018.
on december 22, 2017, the president signed the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act"). the tax act, among other things, lowered the u.s. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018. consequently, we wrote down our net deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2017 by $2.0 billion to reflect the estimated impact of the tax act. we recorded a corresponding net one-time charge of $2.0 billion ($6.77 per share), substantially all of which was non-cash, primarily related to enactment of the tax act, the re-measurement of certain net deferred tax assets using the lower u.s. corporate income tax rate, a deemed repatriation tax, and a reduction in the u.s. manufacturing benefit as a result of our decision to accelerate contributions to our pension fund in 2018 in order to receive a tax deduction in 2017.
we applied the guidance in staff accounting bulletin 118 when accounting for the enactment-date effects of the tax act in 2017 and throughout 2018. at december 31, 2017, we had substantially completed our provisional analysis of the income tax effects of the tax act and recorded a reasonable estimate in 2017 of such effects. during 2018, we refined our calculations, evaluated changes in interpretations and assumptions that we had made, applied additional guidance issued by the u.s. government, and evaluated actions and related accounting policy decisions we have made. as of december 22, 2018, we completed our accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax effects of the tax act and did not identify any material changes to the provisional, net, one-time charge for the year ended december 31, 2017, related to the tax act.
state income taxes are included in our operations as general and administrative costs and, under u.s. government regulations, are allowable costs in establishing prices for the products and services we sell to the u.s. government. therefore, a substantial portion of state income taxes is included in our net sales and cost of sales. as a result, the impact of certain transactions on our operating profit and of other matters presented in these consolidated financial statements is disclosed net of state income taxes. our total net state income tax expense was $83 million for 2018, $103 million for 2017, and $112 million for 2016.

(a)   includes a deferred tax re-measurement and transition tax true-up in 2018 and one-time charge in 2017 primarily due to the re-measurement of certain net deferred tax assets using the lower u.s. corporate income tax rate and a deemed repatriation tax.
(b)   includes a reduction in our 2017 manufacturing benefit as a result of our decision to accelerate contributions to our pension funds in 2018. the tax act repealed the manufacturing benefit for years after 2017.
(c)   recognized tax benefit of $61 million in 2018 from our change in a tax accounting method related to restoration of tax basis.
tax benefits from u.s. research and development (r&d) tax credits were $138 million in 2018, $115 million in 2017, and $107 million in 2016.
we recognized a new tax benefit of $61 million in 2018 from the deduction for foreign derived intangible income enacted by the tax act. the tax act repealed the u.s. manufacturing deduction for years after 2017. therefore, there was no u.s. manufacturing benefit in 2018. tax benefits from the u.s. manufacturing deduction were $7 million in 2017 and $117 million in 2016.
we receive a tax deduction for dividends paid on shares of our common stock held by certain of our defined contribution plans with an employee stock ownership plan feature. the benefit of the tax deduction has declined, principally due to the lower tax rate in 2018.
in 2016, we adopted the accounting standard update for employee share-based payment awards on a prospective basis. accordingly, we recognized additional income tax benefits of $55 million in 2018, $106 million in 2017, and $152 million in 2016.
we also recognized a tax benefit of $61 million in 2018 from our change in a tax accounting method reflecting a 2012 court of federal claims decision, which held that the tax basis in certain assets should be increased and realized upon the assets' disposition. the 2016 income tax rate also benefited from the nontaxable gain recorded in connection with the consolidation of awe.
we participate in the irs compliance assurance process program. examinations of the years 2017 and 2018 remain under irs review.

(a)   components of our federal and foreign deferred income tax assets and liabilities at december 31, 2017 after taking into account the estimated impacts of the tax act and related items.
(b)   the increase in 2018 is primarily due to lower tax deductions for pension contributions resulting from our 2017 decision to accelerate pension contributions to our pension fund in order to receive a deduction in 2017.
(c)   a valuation allowance was provided against certain foreign company deferred tax assets arising from carryforwards of unused tax benefits.
as of december 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, our liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits were not material.
we and our subsidiaries file income tax returns in the u.s. federal jurisdiction and various foreign jurisdictions. with few exceptions, the statute of limitations is no longer open for u.s. federal or non-u.s. income tax examinations for the years before 2015, other than with respect to refunds.
we received net federal and foreign income tax refunds of $41 million in 2018, primarily due to a 2017 net operating loss carryback arising from our accelerated pension contributions. our federal and foreign income tax payments, net of refunds received, were $1.1 billion in 2017 and $1.3 billion in 2016.

revolving credit facilities on august 24, 2018, we entered into a new $2.5 billion revolving credit facility (the 5-year facility) with various banks and concurrently terminated our existing $2.5 billion revolving credit facility. the 5‐year facility has an expiration date of august 24, 2023 and is available for general corporate purposes. the undrawn portion of the 5-year facility is also available to serve as a backup facility for the issuance of commercial paper. we may request and the banks may grant, at their discretion, an increase in the borrowing capacity under the 5-year facility of up to an additional $500 million. there were no borrowings outstanding under the 5-year facility as of december 31, 2018 and 2017.
borrowings under the 5-year facility are unsecured and bear interest at rates based, at our option, on a eurodollar rate or a base rate, as defined in the 5-year facility's agreement. each bank's obligation to make loans under the 5-year facility is subject to, among other things, our compliance with various representations, warranties, and covenants, including covenants limiting our ability and certain of our subsidiaries' ability to encumber assets and a covenant not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the 5‐year facility agreement. as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the 5-year facility agreement, as well as in our debt agreements.
long-term debt in november 2018, we repaid $750 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 1.85% according to their scheduled maturities.
in september 2017, we issued notes totaling approximately $1.6 billion with a fixed interest rate of 4.09% maturing in september 2052 (the new notes) in exchange for outstanding notes totaling approximately $1.4 billion with fixed interest rates ranging from 4.70% to 8.50% maturing 2029 to 2046 (the old notes). in connection with the exchange of principal, we paid a premium of $237 million, substantially all of which was in the form of new notes. this premium will be amortized as additional interest expense over the term of the new notes using the effective interest method. we may, at our option, redeem some or all of the new notes at any time by paying the principal amount of notes being redeemed plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest. interest on the new notes is payable on march 15 and september 15 of each year and began on march 15,
89
2018. the new notes are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
we made interest payments of approximately $635 million, $610 million and $600 million during the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
in september 2016, we repaid $500 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 2.13% according to their scheduled maturities. in may 2016, we repaid $452 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 7.65% according to their scheduled maturities. we also had related variable interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $450 million mature, which did not have a significant impact on net earnings or comprehensive income.
short-term debt and commercial paper as of december 31, 2018, we had $1.5 billion of short-term borrowings due within one year, of which approximately $900 million was composed of scheduled debt maturity due in november 2019 and approximately $600 million was composed of commercial paper borrowings with a weighted-average rate of 2.89%. during 2017, we borrowed and fully repaid amounts under our commercial paper programs. there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of december 31, 2017. we expect to continue to issue commercial paper backed by our $2.5 billion 5‐year facility to manage the timing of cash flows.
note 11 - postretirement benefit plans defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans many of our employees are covered by qualified defined benefit pension plans and we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retirees (collectively, postretirement benefit plans). we also sponsor nonqualified defined benefit pension plans to provide for benefits in excess of qualified plan limits. non-union employees hired after december 2005 do not participate in our qualified defined benefit pension plans, but are eligible to participate in a qualified defined contribution plan in addition to our other retirement savings plans. they also have the ability to participate in our retiree medical plans, but we do not subsidize the cost of their participation in those plans as we do with employees hired before january 1, 2006. over the last few years, we have negotiated similar changes with various labor organizations such that new union represented employees do not participate in our defined benefit pension plans. in june 2014, we amended certain of our qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans for non-union employees, comprising the majority of our benefit obligations, to freeze future retirement benefits. the calculation of retirement benefits under the affected defined benefit pension plans is determined by a formula that takes into account the participants' years of credited service and average compensation. the freeze takes effect in two stages. on january 1, 2016, the pay-based component of the formula used to determine retirement benefits was frozen so that future pay increases, annual incentive bonuses or other amounts earned for or related to periods after december 31, 2015 are not used to calculate retirement benefits. on january 1, 2020, the service-based component of the formula used to determine retirement benefits will also be frozen so that participants will no longer earn further credited service for any period after december 31, 2019. when the freeze is complete, the majority of our salaried employees will have transitioned to an enhanced defined contribution retirement savings plan.
we have made contributions to trusts established to pay future benefits to eligible retirees and dependents, including voluntary employees' beneficiary association trusts and 401(h) accounts, the assets of which will be used to pay expenses of certain retiree medical plans. we use december 31 as the measurement date. benefit obligations as of the end of each year reflect assumptions in effect as of those dates. net periodic benefit cost is based on assumptions in effect at the end of the respective preceding year.
the rules related to accounting for postretirement benefit plans under gaap require us to recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans as either an asset or a liability on our consolidated balance sheets. the funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan's assets and the benefit obligation of the plan.

(a)   total net periodic benefit cost associated with our qualified defined benefit plans represents pension expense calculated in accordance with gaap (fas pension expense). we are required to calculate pension expense in accordance with both gaap and cas rules, each of which results in a different calculated amount of pension expense. the cas pension cost is recovered through the pricing of our products and services on u.s. government contracts and, therefore, is recognized in net sales and cost of sales for products and services. we include the difference between fas pension service cost and cas pension cost, referred to as the fas/cas operating adjustment, as a component of other unallocated, net on our consolidated statements of earnings (see note 5 - information on business segments).

(b)   the 2018 qualified defined benefit pension plan includes a $119 million curtailment gain.

in december 2018, an upfront cash payment of $810 million was made to an insurance company in exchange for a contract (referred to as a buy-in contract) that will reimburse the plan for all future benefit payments related to $770 million of the plan's outstanding defined benefit pension obligations for approximately 9,000 u.s. retirees and beneficiaries. on december 31, 2018, the approximately 9,000 retirees and beneficiaries and the buy-in contract were spun-off to another plan, with the buy-in contract the sole asset of that plan. under the arrangement, the plan remains responsible for paying the benefits for the covered retirees and beneficiaries and the insurance company will reimburse the plan as those benefits are paid. as a result, there is no net ongoing cash flow to the plan for the covered retirees and beneficiaries as the cost of providing the benefits is funded by the buy-in contract, effectively locking in the cost of the benefits and eliminating future volatility of the benefit obligation. the buy-in contract was purchased using assets from the pension trust and is accounted for at fair value as an investment of the trust. this transaction had no impact on our 2018 fas pension expense or cas pension cost. the difference of approximately $40 million between the amount paid to the insurance company and the amount of the pension obligations funded by the buy-in contract was recognized through the re-measurement of the related benefit obligations in other comprehensive loss in equity and will be amortized to fas pension expense in future periods. we intend to begin the termination process for this plan during 2019, and at conclusion convert the buy-in contract to a buy-out contract, thus relieving us of liability for the pension obligations related to the covered population. the buy-out conversion, expected to occur as early as 2020, will require recognition of a settlement loss in earnings at that time, which we currently estimate will be approximately $350 million. a subsequent cash recovery is anticipated from the u.s. government.
also, during december 2018, we purchased an irrevocable group annuity contract from an insurance company (referred to as a buy-out contract) for $1.82 billion to settle $1.76 billion of our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations related to certain u.s. retirees and beneficiaries. the group annuity contract was purchased using assets from the pension trust. as a result of this transaction, we were relieved of all responsibility for these pension obligations and the insurance company is now required to pay and administer the retirement benefits owed to approximately 32,000 u.s. retirees and beneficiaries, with no change to the amount, timing or form of monthly retirement benefit payments. although the transaction was treated as a settlement for accounting purposes, we did not recognize a loss on the settlement in earnings associated with the transaction because total settlements during 2018 for this plan were less than this plan's service and interest cost in 2018. accordingly, the transaction had no impact on our 2018 fas pension expense or cas pension cost, and the difference of approximately $60 million between the amount paid to the insurance company and the amount of the pension obligations settled was recognized in other comprehensive loss and will be amortized to fas pension expense in future periods.

we also sponsor nonqualified defined benefit plans to provide benefits in excess of qualified plan limits. the aggregate liabilities for these plans at december 31, 2018 and 2017 were $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion, which also represent the plans' unfunded status. we have set aside certain assets totaling $425 million and $530 million as of december 31, 2018 and 2017 in a separate trust which we expect to be used to pay obligations under our nonqualified defined benefit plans. in accordance with gaap, those assets may not be used to offset the amount of the benefit obligation similar to the postretirement benefit plans in the table above. the unrecognized net actuarial losses at december 31, 2018 and 2017 were $505 million and $646 million. the unrecognized prior service credit at december 31, 2018 and 2017 were $48 million and $61 million. the expense associated with these plans totaled $123 million in 2018, $126 million in 2017 and $125 million in 2016. we also sponsor a small number of other postemployment plans and foreign benefit plans. the aggregate liability for the other postemployment plans was $46 million and $60 million as of december 31, 2018 and 2017. the expense for the other postemployment plans, as well as the liability and expense associated with the foreign benefit plans, was not material to our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. the actuarial assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and expense associated with our nonqualified defined benefit plans and postemployment plans are similar to those assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and expense related to our qualified defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans as described below.

we expect that approximately $1.2 billion, or about $908 million net of tax, of actuarial losses and net prior service credit related to postretirement benefit plans included in accumulated other comprehensive loss at the end of 2018 to be recognized in net periodic benefit cost during 2019. of this amount, $1.1 billion, or $841 million net of tax, relates to our qualified defined benefit plans and is included in our expected 2019 pension expense of $1.1 billion.

the increase in the discount rate from december 31, 2017 to december 31, 2018 resulted in a decrease in the projected benefit obligations of our qualified defined benefit pension plans of approximately $3.5 billion at december 31, 2018. the decrease in the discount rate from december 31, 2016 to december 31, 2017 resulted in an increase in the projected benefit obligations of our qualified defined benefit pension plans of approximately $2.9 billion at december 31, 2017.
the long-term rate of return assumption represents the expected long-term rate of earnings on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the benefit obligations. that assumption is based on several factors including historical market index returns, the anticipated long-term allocation of plan assets, the historical return data for the trust funds, plan expenses and the potential to outperform market index returns.
plan assets investment policies and strategies - lockheed martin investment management company (lmimco), our wholly-owned subsidiary, has the fiduciary responsibility for making investment decisions related to the assets of our postretirement benefit plans. lmimco's investment objectives for the assets of these plans are (1) to minimize the net present value of expected funding contributions; (2) to ensure there is a high probability that each plan meets or exceeds our actuarial long-term rate of return assumptions; and (3) to diversify assets to minimize the risk of large losses. the nature and duration of benefit obligations, along with assumptions concerning asset class returns and return correlations, are considered when determining an appropriate asset allocation to achieve the investment objectives. investment policies and strategies governing the assets of the plans are designed to achieve investment objectives within prudent risk parameters. risk management practices include the use of external investment managers; the maintenance of a portfolio diversified by asset class, investment approach and security holdings; and the maintenance of sufficient liquidity to meet benefit obligations as they come due.
lmimco's investment policies require that asset allocations of postretirement benefit plans be maintained within the following approximate ranges:

fair value measurements - the rules related to accounting for postretirement benefit plans under gaap require certain fair value disclosures related to postretirement benefit plan assets, even though those assets are not separately presented on our consolidated balance sheets. the following table presents the fair value of the assets (in millions) of our qualified defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans by asset category and their level within the fair value hierarchy, which has three levels based on the uncertainty of the inputs used to determine fair value. level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets, level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs and level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant unobservable inputs. certain other investments are measured at their net asset value (nav) per share and do not have readily determined values and are thus not subject to leveling in the fair value hierarchy. the nav is the total value of the fund divided by the number of the fund's shares outstanding. we recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the date of the change in circumstances that causes the transfer.

(a)   cash and cash equivalents, equity securities and fixed income securities included derivative assets and liabilities whose fair values were not material as of december 31, 2018 and 2017. lmimco's investment policies restrict the use of derivatives to either establish long or short exposures for purposes consistent with applicable investment mandate guidelines or to hedge risks to the extent of a plan's current exposure to such risks. most derivative transactions are settled on a daily basis.
(b)   level 3 investments include $810 million related to the buy-in contract discussed above.
(c)   certain investments that are valued using the nav per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy and are included in the table to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the aggregate postretirement benefit plan assets.
as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, the assets associated with our foreign defined benefit pension plans were not material and have not been included in the table above. excluding the december 2018 purchase of the buy-in contract discussed above, changes in the fair value of plan assets categorized as level 3 during 2018 and 2017 were insignificant.

valuation techniques - cash equivalents are mostly comprised of short-term money-market instruments and are valued at cost, which approximates fair value.
u.s. equity securities and international equity securities categorized as level 1 are traded on active national and international exchanges and are valued at their closing prices on the last trading day of the year. for u.s. equity securities and international equity securities not traded on an active exchange, or if the closing price is not available, the trustee obtains indicative quotes from a pricing vendor, broker or investment manager. these securities are categorized as level 2 if the custodian obtains corroborated quotes from a pricing vendor or categorized as level 3 if the custodian obtains uncorroborated quotes from a broker or investment manager.
commingled equity funds categorized as level 1 are traded on active national and international exchanges and are valued at their closing prices on the last trading day of the year. for commingled equity funds not traded on an active exchange, or if the closing price is not available, the trustee obtains indicative quotes from a pricing vendor, broker or investment manager. these securities are categorized as level 2 if the custodian obtains corroborated quotes from a pricing vendor.
fixed income investments categorized as level 2 are valued by the trustee using pricing models that use verifiable observable market data (e.g., interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals and credit spreads), bids provided by brokers or dealers or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. fixed income investments are categorized as level 3 when valuations using observable inputs are unavailable. the trustee typically obtains pricing based on indicative quotes or bid evaluations from vendors, brokers or the investment manager. in addition, certain other fixed income investments categorized as level 3 are valued using a discounted cash flow approach. significant inputs include projected annuity payments and the discount rate applied to those payments.
certain commingled equity funds, consisting of equity mutual funds, are valued using the nav. the nav valuations are based on the underlying investments and typically redeemable within 90 days.
private equity funds consist of partnership and co-investment funds. the nav is based on valuation models of the underlying securities, which includes unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated using verifiable observable market data. these funds typically have redemption periods between eight and 12 years.
real estate funds consist of partnerships, most of which are closed-end funds, for which the nav is based on valuation models and periodic appraisals. these funds typically have redemption periods between eight and 10 years.
hedge funds consist of direct hedge funds for which the nav is generally based on the valuation of the underlying investments. redemptions in hedge funds are based on the specific terms of each fund, and generally range from a minimum of one month to several months.
contributions and expected benefit payments the funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with erisa, as amended by the ppa, and in a manner consistent with cas and internal revenue code rules. we made contributions of $5.0 billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2018, including required and discretionary contributions. as a result of these contributions, we do not expect to make contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2019.
the following table presents estimated future benefit payments, which reflect expected future employee service, as of december 31, 2018 (in millions):

defined contribution plans we maintain a number of defined contribution plans, most with 401(k) features, that cover substantially all of our employees. under the provisions of our 401(k) plans, we match most employees' eligible contributions at rates specified in the plan documents. our contributions were $658 million in 2018, $613 million in 2017 and $617 million in 2016, the majority of which were funded using our common stock. our defined contribution plans held approximately 33.3 million and 35.5 million shares of our common stock as of december 31, 2018 and 2017.

note 12 - stockholders' equity at december 31, 2018 and 2017, our authorized capital was composed of 1.5 billion shares of common stock and 50 million shares of series preferred stock. of the 283 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of december 31, 2018, 281 million shares were considered outstanding for consolidated balance sheet presentation purposes; the remaining shares were held in a separate trust. of the 285 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of december 31, 2017, 284 million shares were considered outstanding for consolidated balance sheet presentation purposes; the remaining shares were held in a separate trust. no shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding at december 31, 2018 or 2017.
repurchases of common stock during 2018, we repurchased 4.7 million shares of our common stock for $1.5 billion. during 2017 and 2016, we paid $2.0 billion and $2.1 billion to repurchase 7.1 million and 8.9 million shares of our common stock.
on september 27, 2018, our board of directors approved a $1.0 billion increase to our share repurchase program. inclusive of this increase, the total remaining authorization for future common share repurchases under our program was $3.0 billion as of december 31, 2018. as we repurchase our common shares, we reduce common stock for the $1 of par value of the shares repurchased, with the excess purchase price over par value recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. if additional paid-in capital is reduced to zero, we record the remainder of the excess purchase price over par value as a reduction of retained earnings. due to the volume of repurchases made under our share repurchase program, additional paid-in capital was reduced to zero, with the remainder of the excess purchase price over par value of $1.1 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion recorded as a reduction of retained earnings in 2018, 2017 and 2016.
dividends we paid dividends totaling $2.3 billion ($8.20 per share) in 2018, $2.2 billion ($7.46 per share) in 2017 and $2.0 billion ($6.77 per share) in 2016. we paid quarterly dividends of $2.00 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2018 and $2.20 per share during the fourth quarter of 2018; $1.82 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2017 and $2.00 per share during the fourth quarter of 2017; and $1.65 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2016 and $1.82 per share during the fourth quarter of 2016.

note 13 - stock-based compensation during 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded non-cash stock-based compensation expense totaling $173 million, $158 million and $149 million, which is included as a component of other unallocated, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. the net impact to earnings for the respective years was $137 million, $103 million and $97 million.
as of december 31, 2018, we had $101 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.8 years. we received cash from the exercise of stock options totaling $43 million, $71 million and $106 million during 2018, 2017 and 2016. in addition, our income tax liabilities for 2018, 2017 and 2016 were reduced by $75 million, $203 million and $219 million due to recognized tax benefits on stock-based compensation arrangements.
stock-based compensation plans under plans approved by our stockholders, we are authorized to grant key employees stock-based incentive awards, including options to purchase common stock, stock appreciation rights, rsus, psus or other stock units. the exercise price of options to purchase common stock may not be less than the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant. no award of stock options may become fully vested prior to the third anniversary of the grant and no portion of a stock option grant may become vested in less than one year. the minimum vesting period for restricted stock or stock units payable in stock is three years. award agreements may provide for shorter or pro-rated vesting periods or vesting following termination of employment in the case of death, disability, divestiture, retirement, change of control or layoff. the maximum term of a stock option or any other award is 10 years.
at december 31, 2018, inclusive of the shares reserved for outstanding stock options, rsus and psus, we had approximately nine million shares reserved for issuance under the plans. at december 31, 2018, approximately five million of the shares reserved for issuance remained available for grant under our stock-based compensation plans. we issue new shares upon the exercise of stock options or when restrictions on rsus and psus have been satisfied.

in 2018, we granted certain employees approximately 0.4 million rsus with a weighted average grant-date fair value of $353.99 per rsu. the grant-date fair value of these rsus is equal to the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date less a discount to reflect the delay in payment of dividend-equivalent cash payments that are made only upon vesting, which is generally three years from the grant date. we recognize the grant-date fair value of rsus, less estimated forfeitures, as compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period, which is shorter than the vesting period if the employee is retirement eligible on the date of grant or will become retirement eligible before the end of the vesting period.
99
stock options we generally recognize compensation cost for stock options ratably over the three-year vesting period. at december 31, 2018 and 2017, there were 1.8 million (weighted average exercise price of $79.76) and 2.2 million (weighted average exercise price of $82.71) stock options outstanding. all of the stock options outstanding are vested as of december 31, 2018 and have a weighted average remaining contractual life of approximately 1.9 years and an aggregate intrinsic value of $326 million. there were 0.4 million (weighted average exercise price of $94.63) stock options exercised during 2018. we have not granted stock options to employees since 2012. the intrinsic value of all stock options exercised was $104 million, $139 million, and $172 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016.
psus in 2018, we granted certain employees psus with an aggregate target award of approximately 0.1 million shares of our common stock. the psus vest three years from the grant date based on continuous service, with the number of shares earned (0% to 200% of the target award) depending upon the extent to which we achieve certain financial and market performance targets measured over the period from january 1, 2018 through december 31, 2020. about half of the psus were valued at $354.60 per psu in a manner similar to rsus mentioned above as the financial targets are based on our operating results. we recognize the grant-date fair value of these psus, less estimated forfeitures, as compensation expense ratably over the vesting period based on the number of awards expected to vest at each reporting date. the remaining psus were valued at $420.75 per psu using a monte carlo model as the performance target is related to our total shareholder return relative to our peer group. we recognize the grant-date fair value of these awards, less estimated forfeitures, as compensation expense ratably over the vesting period.
note 14 - legal proceedings, commitments and contingencies we are a party to or have property subject to litigation and other proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business, including matters arising under provisions relating to the protection of the environment and are subject to contingencies related to certain businesses we previously owned. these types of matters could result in fines, penalties, compensatory or treble damages or non-monetary sanctions or relief. we believe the probability is remote that the outcome of each of these matters, including the legal proceedings described below, will have a material adverse effect on the corporation as a whole, notwithstanding that the unfavorable resolution of any matter may have a material effect on our net earnings in any particular interim reporting period. among the factors that we consider in this assessment are the nature of existing legal proceedings and claims, the asserted or possible damages or loss contingency (if estimable), the progress of the case, existing law and precedent, the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers, our experience in similar cases and the experience of other companies, the facts available to us at the time of assessment and how we intend to respond to the proceeding or claim. our assessment of these factors may change over time as individual proceedings or claims progress.
although we cannot predict the outcome of legal or other proceedings with certainty, where there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred, gaap requires us to disclose an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss or make a statement that such an estimate cannot be made. we follow a thorough process in which we seek to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, and only if we are unable to make such an estimate do we conclude and disclose that an estimate cannot be made. accordingly, unless otherwise indicated below in our discussion of legal proceedings, a reasonably possible loss or range of loss associated with any individual legal proceeding cannot be estimated.
legal proceedings as a result of our acquisition of sikorsky, we assumed the defense of and any potential liability for two civil false claims act lawsuits pending in the u.s. district court for the eastern district of wisconsin. in october 2014, the u.s. government filed a complaint in intervention in the first suit, which was brought by qui tam relator mary patzer, a former derco aerospace (derco) employee. in may 2017, the u.s. government filed a complaint in intervention in the second suit, which was brought by qui tam relator peter cimma, a former sikorsky support services, inc. (sssi) employee. in november 2017, the court consolidated the cases into a single action for discovery and trial.
the u.s. government alleges that sikorsky and two of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, derco and sssi, violated the civil false claims act and the truth in negotiations act in connection with a contract the u.s. navy awarded to sssi in june 2006 to support the navy's t-34 and t-44 fixed-wing turboprop training aircraft. sssi subcontracted with derco, primarily to procure and manage spare parts for the training aircraft. the u.s. government contends that sssi overbilled the navy on the contract as the result of derco's use of prohibited cost-plus-percentage-of-cost pricing to add profit and overhead costs as a percentage of the price of the spare parts that derco procured and then sold to sssi. the u.s. government also alleges that derco's claims to sssi, sssi's claims to the navy, and sssi's yearly certificates of final indirect costs from 2006 through 2012 were false and that sssi
100
submitted inaccurate cost or pricing data in violation of the truth in negotiations act for a sole-sourced, follow-on "bridge" contract. the u.s. government's complaints assert common law claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment.
the u.s. government further alleged violations of the anti-kickback act and false claims act based on a monthly "chargeback," through which sssi billed derco for the cost of certain sssi personnel, allegedly in exchange for sssi's permitting a pricing arrangement that was "highly favorable" to derco. on january 12, 2018, the corporation filed a partial motion to dismiss intended to narrow the u.s. government's claims, including by seeking dismissal of the anti-kickback act allegations. the corporation also moved to dismiss cimma as a party under the false claims act's first-to-file rule, which permits only the first relator to recover in a pending case. the district court granted these motions, in part, on july 20, 2018, dismissing the government's claims under the anti-kickback act and dismissing cimma as a party to the litigation.
before the district court's july 20, 2018 ruling, the u.s. government sought damages of approximately $52 million, subject to trebling, plus statutory penalties. we do not know what effect, if any, the ruling will have on the u.s. government's calculation of damages. we believe that we have legal and factual defenses to the u.s. government's remaining claims. although we continue to evaluate our liability and exposure, we do not currently believe that it is probable that we will incur a material loss. if, contrary to our expectations, the u.s. government prevails in this matter and proves damages at or near $52 million and is successful in having such damages trebled, the outcome could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability is recognized and on our cash flows for the period in which any damages are paid.
on april 24, 2009, we filed a declaratory judgment action against the new york metropolitan transportation authority and its capital construction company (collectively, the mta) asking the u.s. district court for the southern district of new york to find that the mta is in material breach of our agreement based on the mta's failure to provide access to sites where work must be performed and the customer-furnished equipment necessary to complete the contract. the mta filed an answer and counterclaim alleging that we breached the contract and subsequently terminated the contract for alleged default. the primary damages sought by the mta are the costs to complete the contract and potential re-procurement costs. while we are unable to estimate the cost of another contractor to complete the contract and the costs of re-procurement, we note that our contract with the mta had a total value of $323 million, of which $241 million was paid to us, and that the mta is seeking damages of approximately $190 million. we dispute the mta's allegations and are defending against them. additionally, following an investigation, our sureties on a performance bond related to this matter, who were represented by independent counsel, concluded that the mta's termination of the contract was improper. finally, our declaratory judgment action was later amended to include claims for monetary damages against the mta of approximately $95 million. this matter was taken under submission by the district court in december 2014, after a five-week bench trial and the filing of post-trial pleadings by the parties. we continue to await a decision from the district court. although this matter relates to our former is&gs business, we retained the litigation when we divested is&gs in 2016.
as previously disclosed, on august 16, 2016, we divested our former is&gs business segment to leidos holdings, inc. (leidos) in a transaction which resulted in is&gs, now known as leidos innovations corporation (leidos innovations), becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of leidos (the transaction). in the transaction, leidos acquired is&gs' interest in mission support alliance, llc (msa), a joint venture that holds a prime contract to provide infrastructure support services at the department of energy's hanford facility and the liabilities related to lockheed martin's participation in msa. included within the liabilities assumed were those associated with ongoing investigations by the department of energy and the department of justice (doj) related to work performed at hanford (the investigations). in the transaction, lockheed martin transferred to leidos a reserve slightly in excess of $38 million lockheed martin had established with respect to its potential liability and that of its affiliates arising out of the investigations and agreed to indemnify leidos innovations with respect to the liabilities assumed for damages to leidos innovations and an enumerated list of subsidiaries of leidos innovations related to the investigations for 100% of amounts in excess of this reserve up to $64 million and 50% of amounts in excess of $64 million.
in the investigations, doj issued a number of civil investigative demands to msa, lockheed martin and the subsidiary of lockheed martin that performed information technology services for msa, as well as current and former employees of each of these entities. the investigations relate primarily to information technology services performed by a subsidiary of lockheed martin under a subcontract to msa. doj recently stated that they are preparing to file a complaint alleging civil false claims act violations. we cannot reasonably estimate our exposure at this time, but it is possible that a settlement or judgment against any of the parties being investigated could implicate lockheed martin's indemnification obligations as described above. at present, in view of what we believe to be the strength of the defenses, leidos' assumption of the liabilities and structure of the indemnity, we do not believe it probable that we will incur a material loss.
environmental matters we are involved in proceedings and potential proceedings relating to soil, sediment, surface water, and groundwater contamination, disposal of hazardous waste, and other environmental matters at several of our current or former facilities and at third-party sites where we have been designated as a potentially responsible party (prp). a substantial portion of environmental
101
costs will be included in our net sales and cost of sales in future periods pursuant to u.s. government regulations. at the time a liability is recorded for future environmental costs, we record a receivable for estimated future recovery considered probable through the pricing of products and services to agencies of the u.s. government, regardless of the contract form (e.g., cost-reimbursable, fixed-price). we continually evaluate the recoverability of our environmental receivables by assessing, among other factors, u.s. government regulations, our u.s. government business base and contract mix, our history of receiving reimbursement of such costs, and efforts by some u.s. government representatives to limit such reimbursement. we include the portion of those environmental costs expected to be allocated to our non-u.s. government contracts, or that is determined not to be recoverable under u.s. government contracts, in our cost of sales at the time the liability is established.
at december 31, 2018 and 2017, the aggregate amount of liabilities recorded relative to environmental matters was $864 million and $920 million, most of which are recorded in other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. we have recorded receivables totaling $750 million and $799 million at december 31, 2018 and 2017, most of which are recorded in other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheets, for the estimated future recovery of these costs, as we consider the recovery probable based on the factors previously mentioned. we project costs and recovery of costs over approximately 20 years.
environmental remediation activities usually span many years, which makes estimating liabilities a matter of judgment because of uncertainties with respect to assessing the extent of the contamination as well as such factors as changing remediation technologies and changing regulatory environmental standards. there are a number of former and present operating facilities that we are monitoring or investigating for potential future remediation. we perform quarterly reviews of the status of our environmental remediation sites and the related liabilities and receivables. additionally, in our quarterly reviews, we consider these and other factors in estimating the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for remediation activities, and record a liability when it is probable that a loss has occurred and the loss can be reasonably estimated. the amount of liability recorded is based on our estimate of the costs to be incurred for remediation at a particular site. we do not discount the recorded liabilities, as the amount and timing of future cash payments are not fixed or cannot be reliably determined. we reasonably cannot determine the extent of our financial exposure in all cases as, although a loss may be probable or reasonably possible, in some cases it is not possible at this time to estimate the loss or reasonably possible loss or range of loss.
we also pursue claims for recovery of costs incurred or for contribution to site cleanup costs against other prps, including the u.s. government, and are conducting remediation activities under various consent decrees, orders, and agreements relating to soil, groundwater, sediment, or surface water contamination at certain sites of former or current operations. under agreements related to certain sites in california and new york, the u.s. government reimburses us an amount equal to a percentage, specific to each site, of expenditures for certain remediation activities in the u.s. government's capacity as a prp under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act (cercla).
in addition to the proceedings and potential proceedings discussed above, california previously established a maximum level of the contaminant hexavalent chromium in drinking water of 10 parts per billion (ppb). this standard was successfully challenged by the california manufacturers and technology association (cmta) for failure to conduct the required economic feasibility analysis. in response to the court's ruling, the state water resources control board (state board), a branch of the california environmental protection agency, withdrew the hexavalent chromium standard from the published regulations, leaving only the 50 ppb standard for total chromium. the state board has indicated it will work to re-establish a hexavalent chromium standard. if the standard for hexavalent chromium is re‐established at 10 ppb or above, it will not have a material impact on our existing environmental remediation costs in california. further, the u.s. environmental protection agency (u.s. epa) is considering whether to regulate hexavalent chromium.
california is also reevaluating its existing drinking water standard of 6 ppb for perchlorate, and the u.s. epa is taking steps to regulate perchlorate in drinking water. if substantially lower standards are adopted, in either california or at the federal level for perchlorate or for hexavalent chromium, we expect a material increase in our estimates for environmental liabilities and the related assets for the portion of the increased costs that are probable of future recovery in the pricing of our products and services for the u.s. government. the amount that would be allocable to our non-u.s. government contracts or that is determined not to be recoverable under u.s. government contracts would be expensed, which may have a material effect on our earnings in any particular interim reporting period.
operating leases we rent certain equipment and facilities under operating leases. certain major plant facilities and equipment are furnished by the u.s. government under short-term or cancelable arrangements. our total rental expense under operating leases was $247 million, $169 million and $202 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016. future minimum lease commitments at december 31, 2018 for long-term non-cancelable operating leases were $1.3 billion ($305 million in 2019, $184 million in 2020, $147 million in 2021, $114 million in 2022, $88 million in 2023 and $459 million in later years).
102
letters of credit, surety bonds and third-party guarantees we have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds issued on our behalf by financial institutions, and directly issued guarantees to third parties primarily relating to advances received from customers and the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts. letters of credit and surety bonds generally are available for draw down in the event we do not perform. in some cases, we may guarantee the contractual performance of third parties such as venture partners. we had total outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and third-party guarantees aggregating $3.6 billion at december 31, 2018 and $3.3 billion at december 31, 2017. third-party guarantees do not include guarantees of subsidiaries and other consolidated entities.
at december 31, 2018 and 2017, third-party guarantees totaled $850 million and $750 million, of which approximately 65% and 62% related to guarantees of contractual performance of ventures to which we currently are or previously were a party. this amount represents our estimate of the maximum amount we would expect to incur upon the contractual non-performance of the venture, venture partners or divested businesses. generally, we also have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a venture partner.
in determining our exposures, we evaluate the reputation, performance on contractual obligations, technical capabilities and credit quality of our current and former venture partners and the transferee under novation agreements all of which include a guarantee as required by the far. there were no material amounts recorded in our financial statements related to third-party guarantees or novation agreements.
united launch alliance in connection with our 50% ownership interest of ula, we and the boeing company (boeing) were previously required to provide ula an additional capital contribution if ula was unable to make required payments under its inventory supply agreement with boeing. in the fourth quarter of 2018, ula fully satisfied its obligations under this inventory supply agreement and we no longer have any obligation to provide ula an additional capital contribution under this agreement.
our share of ula's net earnings are reported as equity in net earnings (losses) of equity investees in other income, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. our investment in ula totaled $687 million and $794 million at december 31, 2018 and 2017.
note 15 - severance and restructuring charges
2018 actions during 2018, we recorded charges totaling $96 million ($76 million, or $0.26 per share, after tax) related to certain severance and restructuring actions at our rms business segment. these charges consist of $75 million of severance costs for the planned elimination of certain positions through either voluntary or involuntary actions and $21 million of asset impairment charges associated with our decision to consolidate certain operations. upon separation, terminated employees will receive lump-sum severance payments primarily based on years of service, a majority of which we expect to pay by the end of 2019. these actions resulted from a strategic review of our rms business segment and are intended to improve the efficiency of our operations and better align our organization and cost structure with changing economic conditions. we expect to recover a portion of the severance and restructuring charges through the pricing of our products and services to the u.s. government and other customers in future periods, which will be included in rms' operating results. during 2018, we paid approximately $33 million in severance payments associated with these actions.
2016 actions during 2016, we recorded severance charges totaling approximately $80 million related to our aeronautics business segment. the charges consisted of severance costs associated with the planned elimination of certain positions through either voluntary or involuntary actions. upon separation, terminated employees receive lump-sum severance payments primarily based on years of service, the majority of which are expected to be paid over the next several quarters. as of the end of the first quarter of 2017, we had substantially paid the severance costs associated with these actions.

substantially all assets measured at fair value, other than derivatives, represent investments held in a separate trust to fund certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans and are recorded in other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheets. the fair values of mutual funds and certain other securities are determined by reference to the quoted market price per unit in active markets multiplied by the number of units held without consideration of transaction costs. the fair values of u.s. government and other securities are determined using pricing models that use observable inputs (e.g., interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals), bids provided by brokers or dealers or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. the fair values of derivative instruments, which consist of foreign currency exchange forward and interest rate swap contracts, primarily are determined based on the present value of future cash flows using model-derived valuations that use observable inputs such as interest rates, credit spreads and foreign currency exchange rates.
in addition to the financial instruments listed in the table above, we hold other financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and debt and commercial paper. the carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable approximated their fair values. the estimated fair value of our outstanding debt and commercial paper was $15.4 billion and $16.8 billion at december 31, 2018 and 2017. the outstanding principal amount was $15.3 billion and $15.5 billion at december 31, 2018 and 2017, excluding $1.2 billion of unamortized discounts and issuance costs. the estimated fair values of our outstanding debt were determined based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets (level 2).

(a)   the sum of the quarterly earnings per share amounts do not equal the earnings per share amounts included on our consolidated statements of earnings. the difference in 2018 relates to the timing of our share repurchases. in addition to the timing of our share repurchases, the difference in 2017 was primarily due to the net loss in the fourth quarter causing any potentially dilutive securities to have an anti-dilutive effect, which resulted in the weighted average shares outstanding for basic and dilutive earnings per share being equivalent.
(b)   the second quarter of 2018 includes a $96 million ($76 million or $0.26 per share, after tax) severance and restructuring charge (see "note 15 - severance and restructuring charges").
(c)   the fourth quarter of 2018 includes a non-cash asset impairment charge of $110 million ($83 million, or $0.29 per share, after tax) related to our equity method investee, ammroc (see "note 1 - significant accounting policies").
(d)   the first quarter of 2017 includes a $120 million ($74 million or $0.25 per share, after tax) charge on our eadge-t program and a $64 million ($40 million or $0.14 per share, after tax) charge, which represents our portion of a non-cash asset impairment charge recorded by our equity method investee, ammroc (see "note 1 - significant accounting policies").
(e)   in the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a net one-time tax charge of $2.0 billion ($6.88 per share in the fourth quarter), substantially all of which was non-cash, primarily related to the estimated impact of the tax act (see "note 9 - income taxes"). in addition, the fourth quarter of 2017 includes a previously deferred non-cash gain of $198 million ($122 million or $0.43 per share, after tax) related to properties sold in 2015 as a result of completing our remaining obligations.
(f)   the fourth quarter of 2017 includes a net gain of $73 million, reported in net earnings from discontinued operations, related to the 2016 divestiture of our former is&amp;gs business.

management's report on internal control over financial reporting our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes.
our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2018. this assessment was based on the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal control-integrated framework (2013 framework). based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31, 2018.
our independent registered public accounting firm has issued a report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which is below.
changes in internal control over financial reporting there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by rules 13a-15(d) and 15d‐15(d) of the exchange act that occurred during the quarter ended december 31, 2018 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

report of independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting board of directors and stockholders lockheed martin corporation opinion on internal control over financial reporting we have audited lockheed martin corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2018, based on criteria established in internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (2013 framework) (the coso criteria). in our opinion, lockheed martin corporation (the corporation) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2018, based on the coso criteria.
we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob), the consolidated balance sheets of the corporation as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2018, and the related notes and our report dated february 8, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
basis for opinion the corporation's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management's report on internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the corporation's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the corporation in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting a company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

(2)   the shares represent annual incentive bonuses and long-term incentive performance (ltip) payments earned and voluntarily deferred by employees. the deferred amounts are payable under the deferred management incentive compensation plan (dmicp). deferred amounts are credited as phantom stock units at the closing price of our stock on the date the deferral is effective. amounts equal to our dividend are credited as stock units at the time we pay a dividend. following termination of employment, a number of shares of stock equal to the number of stock units credited to the employee's dmicp account are distributed to the employee. there is no discount or value transfer on the stock distributed. distributions may be made from newly issued shares or shares purchased on the open market. historically, all distributions have come from shares held in a separate trust and, therefore, do not further dilute our common shares outstanding. as a result, these shares also were not considered in calculating the total weighted average exercise price in the table. because the dmicp shares are outstanding, they should be included in the denominator (and not the numerator) of a dilution calculation.

item 7.    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview we are a global security and aerospace company principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. we also provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistics, system integration and cybersecurity services. we serve both u.s. and international customers with products and services that have defense, civil and commercial applications, with our principal customers being agencies of the u.s. government. in 2018, 70% of our $53.8 billion in net sales were from the u.s. government, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor (including 60% from the department of defense (dod)), 28% were from international customers (including foreign military sales (fms) contracted through the u.s. government) and 2% were from u.s. commercial and other customers. our main areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information technology, including cybersecurity.
we operate in four business segments: aeronautics, missiles and fire control (mfc), rotary and mission systems (rms) and space. we organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered.
we operate in an environment characterized by both complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures in the u.s. and globally. a significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on program execution, improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our products and services, and placing security capability quickly into the hands of our u.s. and international customers at affordable prices. recognizing that our customers are resource constrained, we are endeavoring to develop and extend our portfolio domestically in a disciplined manner with a focus on adjacent markets close to our core capabilities, as well as growing our international sales. we continue to focus on affordability initiatives. we also expect to continue to innovate and invest in technologies to fulfill new mission requirements for our customers and invest in our people so that we have the technical skills necessary to succeed without limiting our ability to return a substantial portion of our free cash flow to our investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases. we define free cash flow as cash from operations as determined under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap), less capital expenditures as presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows.
2019 financial trends we expect our 2019 net sales to increase in the mid-single digit range from 2018 levels. the projected growth is driven by increased production and sustainment on the f-35 program at aeronautics and key contract awards and increased volume in the tactical and strike missiles business at mfc. total business segment operating profit margin in 2019 is expected to be approximately 10.8%; and cash from operations is expected to be greater than or equal to $7.4 billion. the preliminary outlook for 2019 assumes the u.s. government continues to support and fund our key programs. changes in circumstances may require us to revise our assumptions, which could materially change our current estimate of 2019 net sales, operating margin and cash flows.
we expect the net 2019 fas/cas pension benefit to be approximately $1.5 billion based on a 4.25% discount rate (a 62.5 basis point increase from the end of 2017), a negative 5.00% return on plan assets in 2018, a 7.00% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets in future years (a 50 basis point decrease from the end of 2017), and the revised longevity assumptions released during the fourth quarter of 2018 by the society of actuaries. as a result of our $5.0 billion in contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2018, we do not expect to make contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2019.
portfolio shaping activities we continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers. we accomplish this in part by our independent research and development activities and through acquisition, divestiture and internal realignment activities.
we selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses and investments at attractive valuations that will expand or complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customers or technologies. we also may explore the divestiture of businesses that no longer meet our needs or strategy or that could perform better outside of our organization. in pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures, ventures and equity investments.
25
divestiture of the information systems & global solutions business on august 16, 2016, we divested our former information systems & global solutions (is&gs) business, which merged with leidos holdings, inc. (leidos), in a reverse morris trust transaction (the "transaction"). as a result of the transaction, we recognized a net gain of approximately $1.3 billion, including $1.2 billion recognized in 2016. in 2017, we recognized an additional gain of $73 million, which reflects certain post-closing adjustments, including certain tax adjustments and the final determination of net working capital. for additional information, see "note 3 - acquisition and divestitures" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements.
consolidation of awe management limited on august 24, 2016, we increased our ownership interest in the awe management limited (awe) joint venture, which operates the united kingdom's nuclear deterrent program, from 33% to 51%. consequently, we began consolidating awe and our operating results include 100% of awe's sales and 51% of its operating profit. prior to increasing our ownership interest, we accounted for our investment in awe using the equity method of accounting. under the equity method, we recognized only 33% of awe's earnings or losses and no sales. accordingly, prior to august 24, 2016, the date we obtained control, we recorded 33% of awe's net earnings in our operating results and subsequent to august 24, 2016, we recognized 100% of awe's sales and 51% of its operating profit.
for additional information, see "note 3 - acquisition and divestitures" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements.
industry considerations u.s. government funding for the first time in nearly a decade, the dod began the government fiscal year (fy) with a full-year appropriation. congress passed, and the president signed into law an appropriation act that provides $685 billion in funding for the dod for fy 2019, which is comprised of $617 billion in base funding and $68 billion for the overseas contingency operations (oco) account to support the global war on terrorism (gwot). the appropriation adheres to the bipartisan budget act of 2018 (bba of 2018), which provided an additional $80 billion for national defense over two years in fy 2018 and fy 2019. however, the u.s. government has not yet passed full-year appropriations for all agencies. a majority of u.s. government agencies operated under continuing resolution funding measures through december 21, 2018. congress was unable to reach an agreement on full-year appropriations prior to its expiration. consequently, a majority of u.s. government agencies were shutdown through january 25, 2019 when an agreement was reached to provide funding under a continuing resolution funding measure through february 15, 2019. these agencies may be subject to future shutdowns if new appropriations are not passed prior to the expiration of the current continuing resolution.
the president has not yet submitted the budget proposal for fy 2020 to congress due to administrative delays associated with the partial government shutdown that began on december 22, 2018 and ended on january 25, 2019. once submitted, congress must approve or revise the president's fy 2020 budget proposal through enactment of appropriations bills and other policy legislation, which would then require final approval from the president.
currently, u.s. defense spending in fy 2020 and fy 2021 remains subject to statutory spending limits established by the budget control act of 2011 (budget control act). the budget control act spending limits were modified for fiscal years 2013 through 2019 by the american taxpayer relief act of 2012, the bipartisan budget act of 2013, the bipartisan budget act of 2015, and most recently the bba of 2018. however, these acts do not alter the spending limits beyond fy 2019. as currently enacted, the budget control act limits defense spending to $576 billion (including approximately $550 billion for dod) for fy 2020 with a modest increase to $590 billion (including approximately $563 billion for dod) in 2021. the president's defense budget estimates for fy 2020 and beyond exceed the spending limits established by the budget control act. as a result, continued budget uncertainty and the risk of future sequestration cuts remain unless the budget control act is repealed or significantly modified. see also the discussion of u.s. government funding risks within item 1a - risk factors.

international business a key component of our strategic plan is to grow our international sales. to accomplish this growth, we continue to focus on strengthening our relationships internationally through partnerships and joint technology efforts. we conduct business with international customers through each of our business segments through either fms or direct sales to international customers.
international customers accounted for 36% of aeronautics' 2018 net sales. there continues to be strong international interest in the f-35 program, which includes commitments from the u.s. government and eight international partner countries and four international customers, as well as expressions of interest from other countries. the u.s. government and the eight partner countries continue to work together on the design, testing, production, and sustainment of the f-35 program. the international commitment to the program continues to grow. during 2018, the government of belgium announced its decision to purchase 34 f-35 aircraft. additionally in 2018, we finalized the low rate initial production (lrip) 11 contract with the dod at $11.5 billion of funding for the production of 141 f-35 aircraft. this award includes international f-35 partners and fms customers. other areas of international expansion at our aeronautics business segment include the f-16 program. during 2018, we received a $1.1 billion contract from the u.s. government to produce 16 new production f-16 block 70 aircraft for the royal bahraini air force. the undefinitized contract action (uca) award represents the first f-16 block 70 sale and the first f-16 production program to be performed in greenville, south carolina. additionally, in december 2018, slovakia signed a letter of offer and acceptance (loa) to procure 14 new production f-16 block 70/72 aircraft and we were awarded a contract to upgrade 84 f-16 aircraft for the greek ministry of defence.
in 2018, international customers accounted for 26% of mfc's net sales. our mfc business segment continues to generate significant international interest, most notably in the air and missile defense product line, which produces the patriot advanced capability-3 (pac-3) and terminal high altitude area defense (thaad) systems. the pac-3 is an advanced missile defense system designed to intercept incoming airborne threats. we have ongoing pac-3 programs for production and sustainment activities in the kingdom of saudi arabia, uae, qatar, the republic of korea, japan and taiwan. additionally during 2018, the u.s. and swedish officials formalized an agreement to provide pac-3 missiles to sweden. thaad is an integrated system designed to protect against high altitude ballistic missile threats. uae is an international customer for thaad, and other countries in the middle east, europe and the asia-pacific region have also expressed interest in our air and missile defense systems, including the kingdom of saudi arabia. additionally, we continue to see international demand for our tactical missile and fire control products, where we received orders for hellfire missile systems from the netherlands and japan, precision fires systems from romania, as well as interest from poland, where we will be submitting a proposal for a multiple launch rocket system (mlrs). other mfc international customers include the united kingdom, germany, india, kuwait, and bahrain.
in 2018, international customers accounted for 26% of rms' net sales. our rms business segment continues to experience international interest in the aegis ballistic missile defense system. we perform activities in the development, production, modernization, ship integration, test and lifetime support for ships of international customers such as japan, spain, republic of korea, and australia. we have ongoing programs in canada and chile for combat systems equipment upgrades on halifax-class and type 23 frigates. in our training and logistics solutions portfolio, we have active programs and pursuits in the united kingdom, the kingdom of saudi arabia, canada, egypt, singapore, and australia. in addition, sikorsky adds a significant international component to the rms business segment with an installed base of over 1,000 aircraft internationally. we have active development, production, and sustainment support of the s-70i black hawk® and mh-60 seahawk® aircraft to foreign military customers, including chile, australia, denmark, taiwan, the kingdom of saudi arabia and colombia. commercial aircraft are sold to customers in the oil and gas industry, emergency medical evacuation, search and rescue fleets, and vip customers in over 30 countries.
international customers accounted for 16% of space's 2018 net sales. our space business segment includes the operations of awe, which operates the united kingdom's nuclear deterrent program. the work at awe covers the entire life cycle, from initial concept, assessment and design, through component manufacture and assembly, in-service support and decommissioning and disposal. in addition, space has international contracts with the kingdom of saudi arabia and japan to design and manufacture geostationary communication satellites using the a2100 satellite platform.

status of the f-35 program the f-35 program primarily consists of production contracts, sustainment activities, and new development efforts. production of the aircraft is expected to continue for many years given the u.s. government's current inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft for the u.s. air force, u.s. marine corps, and u.s. navy; commitments from our eight international partners and three international customers; as well as expressions of interest from other countries.
during 2018, the f-35 program completed several milestones both domestically and internationally. the u.s. government continued testing the aircraft, including ship trials, mission and weapons systems evaluations, and the f-35 fleet recently surpassed 175,000 flight hours. in april 2018, we completed the system development and demonstration (sdd) flight testing portion of the development contract and began the next phase of development in support of phased capability improvements and modernization of the f-35 air system. this next phase of development work is being performed separately from the basic sdd contract as part of the joint program office's continuous capability development and delivery (c2d2) strategy. on june 11, we delivered the 300th production f-35 aircraft, demonstrating the f-35 program's continued progress and longevity. the first 300 f-35 aircraft delivered to u.s. and international customers include 197 f-35a variants, 75 f-35b variants, and 28 f-35c variants. in december 2018, the dod officially approved the f-35 program to begin the formal initial operational test & evaluation (iot&e) phase. testing is expected to be completed during 2019. the data will be analyzed by the u.s. government as part of their evaluation to transition the f-35 program from lrip into full-rate production at the end of 2019.
several milestones were also achieved with our u.s. government and international customers. first, united kingdom's f-35b carried out the first trials with uk-built weapons. this represents a key part of the work-up toward initial operating capability efforts. second, f-35cs' participated in integrated flight operations aboard the uss abraham lincoln. third, a u.s. marine corps f-35b conducted the first combat strike in the u.s. central command area of responsibility in support of operation freedom's sentinel in afghanistan on september 27. fourth, the royal navy landed the f-35b on the hms queen elizabeth.
on september 28, we finalized the lrip 11 contract with the dod at $11.5 billion for the production and delivery of 141 f-35 aircraft at the lowest per aircraft price in program history. in november 2018, the u.s. government awarded an aggregate $22.7 billion uca block buy for the production of 252 f-35 aircraft in order to provide greater production efficiency, stability and cost savings. as of december 31, 2018, we have delivered 357 production aircraft to our u.s. and international partners, and we have 396 production aircraft in backlog, including orders from our international partners.
given the size and complexity of the f-35 program, we anticipate that there will be continual reviews related to aircraft performance, program schedule, cost, and requirements as part of the dod, congressional, and international partners' oversight and budgeting processes. current program challenges include, but are not limited to, supplier and partner performance, software development, level of cost associated with life cycle operations and sustainment and warranties, receiving funding for production contracts on a timely basis, executing future flight tests, findings resulting from testing and operating the aircraft.

(a)   for the year ended december 31, 2018, operating profit includes a non-cash asset impairment charge of $110 million related to our equity method investee, advanced military maintenance, repair and overhaul center llc (ammroc). for the year ended december 31, 2017, operating profit includes a $64 million charge, which represents our portion of a non-cash asset impairment charge recorded by ammroc (see "note 1 - significant accounting policies" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements for more information). for the year ended december 31, 2017, operating profit includes a previously deferred non-cash gain of approximately $198 million related to properties sold in 2015 (see "note 8 - property, plant and equipment, net" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements for more information). for the year ended december 31, 2016, operating profit includes a non-cash gain on the step acquisition of awe of approximately $104 million (see "note 3 - acquisition and divestitures" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements for more information).
(b)   in 2017, we recorded a net one-time tax charge of $2.0 billion ($6.77 per share), substantially all of which was non-cash, primarily related to the estimated impact of the tax cuts and jobs act. see "income tax expense" section below and "note 9 - income taxes" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
certain amounts reported in other income, net, primarily our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees, are included in the operating profit of our business segments. accordingly, such amounts are included in our discussion of our business segment results of operations.

net sales we generate sales from the delivery of products and services to our customers. our consolidated net sales were as follows (in millions):
2018                2017                2016
products                     $45,005             $42,502             $40,081

substantially all of our contracts are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method. under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method, we record net sales on contracts over time based upon our progress towards completion on a particular contract, as well as our estimate of the profit to be earned at completion. the following discussion of material changes in our consolidated net sales should be read in tandem with the subsequent discussion of changes in our consolidated cost of sales and our business segment results of operations because changes in our sales are typically accompanied by a corresponding change in our cost of sales due to the nature of the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method.
product sales product sales increased $2.5 billion, or 6%, in 2018 as compared to 2017. the increase was primarily due to higher product sales of about $1.2 billion at aeronautics, $1.0 billion at mfc and $315 million at rms. higher product sales at aeronautics was primarily due to higher production volume for the f-35 program and higher volume on modernization contracts for the f-16 program. the increase at mfc was primarily due to increased volume for tactical and strike missiles programs (primarily classified programs and precision fires). the increase at rms was primarily due to increased production volume for integrated warfare systems and sensors (iwss) programs (primarily radar surveillance systems).
product sales increased $2.4 billion, or 6%, in 2017 as compared to 2016. the increase was primarily due to higher product sales of about $1.9 billion at aeronautics and $340 million at mfc. the increase in product sales at aeronautics was primarily attributable to higher sales for the f-35 program due to increased production volume and higher sales for the c-130 program due to increased production volume and aircraft configuration mix, partially offset by a decrease in sales for the c-5 program due to lower production volume. higher product sales at mfc was primarily due to an increase in sales for air and missile defense programs due to higher volume (primarily terminal high altitude area defense (thaad)), higher sales for tactical and strike missile programs due to product configuration mix (primarily precision fires) and increased volume (primarily classified programs), and higher sales for sensor and global sustainment programs due to increased volume (primarily low altitude navigation and targeting infrared for night (lantirn®) and sniper®).
service sales service sales increased $1.3 billion, or 17%, in 2018 as compared to 2017, primarily due to an increase in service sales of about $605 million at aeronautics, $270 million at rms, and $245 million at space. the increase in service sales at aeronautics was primarily due to higher sustainment volume for the f-35 and f-22 programs. higher service sales at rms was primarily due to increased volume for c6isr (command, control, communications, computers, cyber, combat systems, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance) and iwss programs. the increase in service sales at space was primarily due to increased volume on government satellite services.
service sales increased $249 million, or 3%, in 2017 as compared to 2016, primarily due to an increase in service sales of about $200 million at aeronautics, $155 million at mfc and $70 million at rms. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in service sales of about $180 million at space. the increase in service sales at aeronautics was primarily due to increased volume on sustainment activities (primarily the f-35 and c-130 programs). higher service sales at mfc was primarily attributable to increased volume on sustainment activities (primarily patriot advanced capability-3 (pac-3) and special operations forces contractor logistics support services (sof clss)). higher service sales at rms was primarily due to increased volume on sustainment activities at sikorsky. the decrease in service sales at space was primarily due to lower launch related volume for space transportation programs, partially offset by increased volume for government satellite services.

cost of sales cost of sales, for both products and services, consist of materials, labor, subcontracting costs, an allocation of indirect costs (overhead and general and administrative), as well as the costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers. for each of our contracts, we monitor the nature and amount of costs at the contract level, which form the basis for estimating our total costs to complete the contract. our consolidated cost of sales were as follows (in millions):
2018                      2017                      2016

the following discussion of material changes in our consolidated cost of sales for products and services should be read in tandem with the preceding discussion of changes in our consolidated net sales and our business segment results of operations. we have not identified any developing trends in cost of sales for products and services that would have a material impact on our future operations.
product costs product costs increased approximately $1.9 billion, or 5%, in 2018 as compared to 2017. the increase was primarily due to increased product costs of about $1.2 billion at aeronautics and $820 million at mfc. higher product costs at aeronautics was primarily due to higher production volume for the f-35 program and higher volume on modernization contracts for the f-16 program. the increase in product costs at mfc was primarily due to increased volume for tactical and strike missiles programs (primarily classified programs and precision fires).
product costs increased approximately $2.0 billion, or 6%, in 2017 as compared to 2016. the increase was primarily due to increased product costs of about $1.5 billion at aeronautics and $315 million at mfc. the increase in product costs at aeronautics was primarily due to increased volume on aircraft production for the f-35 program and higher cost for the c-130 program due to increased production volume and aircraft configuration mix, partially offset by a decrease in cost for the c-5 program due to lower production volume. higher product costs at mfc was primarily attributable to an increase in cost for tactical and strike missile programs due to product configuration mix (primarily precision fires) and increased volume (classified programs) and higher product costs for air and missile defense programs due to contract mix (primarily pac-3) and higher volume (primarily thaad).
service costs service costs increased approximately $1.1 billion, or 16%, in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to increased service costs of about $535 million at aeronautics, $215 million at rms, and $170 million at space. the increase in service costs at aeronautics was primarily due to higher sustainment volume for the f-35 and f-22 programs. higher service costs at rms were primarily due to increased volume for various c6isr and iwss programs. the increase in service costs at space was primarily due to increased volume on government satellite services.
service costs increased approximately $250 million, or 4%, in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to increased service costs of about $230 million at aeronautics and $150 million at mfc. these increases were partially offset by a decrease of about$135 million at space. higher service costs at aeronautics was primarily due to increased volume on sustainment activities (primarily the f-35 and c-130 programs). higher service costs at mfc was primarily attributable to higher volume on sustainment activities (primarily pac-3 and sof clss). the decrease in service costs at space was primarily due to lower launch related volume for space transportation programs, partially offset by increased volume for government satellite services.

restructuring charges
2018 actions during 2018, we recorded charges totaling $96 million ($76 million, or $0.26 per share, after tax) related to certain severance and restructuring actions at our rms business segment. these charges consist of $75 million of severance costs for the planned elimination of certain positions through either voluntary or involuntary actions and $21 million of asset impairment charges associated with our decision to consolidate certain operations. upon separation, terminated employees will receive lump-sum severance payments primarily based on years of service, a majority of which we expect to pay by the end of 2019. these actions resulted from a strategic review of our rms business segment and are intended to improve the efficiency of our operations and better align our organization and cost structure with changing economic conditions. we expect to recover a portion of the severance and restructuring charges through the pricing of our products and services to the u.s. government and other customers in future periods, which will be included in rms' operating results. during 2018, we paid approximately $33 million in severance payments associated with these actions.
2016 actions during 2016, we recorded severance charges totaling approximately $80 million related to our aeronautics business segment. the charges consisted of severance costs associated with the planned elimination of certain positions through either voluntary or involuntary actions. upon separation, terminated employees receive lump-sum severance payments primarily based on years of service, the majority of which are expected to be paid over the next several quarters. as of the end of the first quarter of 2017, we had substantially paid the severance costs associated with these actions.
other unallocated, net other unallocated, net primarily includes the fas/cas operating adjustment as described in the "business segment results of operations" section below, stock-based compensation and other corporate costs. these items are not allocated to the business segments and, therefore, are excluded from the cost of sales for products and services. other unallocated, net was a net reduction to expense of $1.6 billion in 2018, $1.5 billion in 2017 and $1.0 billion in 2016.
the increase in net reduction in expense from 2018 to 2017 and 2017 to 2016 was primarily attributable to fluctuations in the fas/cas operating adjustment of $1.8 billion in 2018, $1.6 billion in 2017 and $1.3 billion in 2016, partially offset by fluctuations in other costs associated with various corporate items, none of which were individually significant. the increase in the fas/cas operating adjustment over the periods was primarily attributable to an increase in u.s. government cost accounting standards (cas) pension cost due to the impact of phasing in cas harmonization. see "critical accounting policies - postretirement benefit plans" discussion below for more information on our cas pension cost. additionally, the increase in net reduction to expense in 2017 as compared to 2016 was driven by corporate overhead costs reclassified during 2016 from our former is&gs business to other unallocated, net. see "note 3 - acquisition and divestitures" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about costs reclassified to other unallocated, net.
other income, net other income, net primarily includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees and gains or losses for acquisitions and divestitures. other income, net in 2018 was $60 million, compared to $373 million in 2017 and $487 million in 2016. the decrease in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily attributable to the recognition in 2018 of a non-cash asset impairment charge of $110 million ($83 million, or $0.29 per share, after tax) related to our equity method investee, ammroc, decreased earnings generated by equity method investees, and the recognition in 2017 of a previously deferred non-cash gain of approximately $198 million related to properties sold in 2015. the decrease in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to decreased earnings generated by equity method investees and recognition in 2017 of our portion of a non-cash asset impairment charge recorded by our equity method investee, ammroc. these decreases were partially offset by the recognition in 2017 of a previously deferred non-cash gain of approximately $198 million related to properties sold in 2015, which was greater than the net gain of $104 million recognized in the third quarter of 2016 on the step acquisition of awe.
32
interest expense interest expense in 2018 was $668 million, compared to $651 million in 2017 and $663 million in 2016. the slight increase in interest expense in 2018 resulted primarily from increased interest expense on interest rate swaps and commercial paper, partially offset by our scheduled repayment of $750 million of debt during 2018. the decrease in interest expense in 2017 resulted primarily from our scheduled repayment of $952 million of debt during 2016. see "capital structure, resources and other" included within "liquidity and cash flows" discussion below and "note 10 - debt" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our debt.
other non-operating expense, net other non-operating expense, net primarily includes the non-service cost components of fas pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense (i.e., interest cost, expected return on plan assets, net actuarial gains or losses, and amortization of prior service cost or credits) related to our postretirement benefit plans. other non-operating expense, net in 2018 decreased slightly compared to 2017 primarily due to fluctuations in other costs associated with various items, none of which were individually significant. other non-operating expense, net increased $376 million from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to higher non-service cost components of fas expense related to a lower discount rate and lower expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
income tax expense our effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 13.6% for 2018, 64.0% for 2017, and 23.0% for 2016. on december 22, 2017, the president signed the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act"). the tax act, among other things, lowered the u.s. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective january 1, 2018. consequently, we wrote down our net deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2017 by $2.0 billion to reflect the estimated impact of the tax act. we recorded a corresponding net one-time charge of $2.0 billion ($6.77 per share), substantially all of which was non-cash, primarily related to enactment of the tax act, the re-measurement of certain net deferred tax assets using the lower u.s. corporate income tax rate (approximately $1.9 billion), a deemed repatriation tax (approximately $43 million), and a reduction in the u.s. manufacturing benefit (approximately $81 million) as a result of our decision to accelerate contributions to our pension fund in 2018 in order to receive a tax deduction in 2017. the net one-time charge related to the tax act increased our 2017 effective income tax rate by 37.5 percentage points. our effective income tax rate and cash tax payments in years after 2017 are expected to benefit materially from the enactment of the tax act. as of december 22, 2018, we completed our accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax effects of the tax act and did not identify any material changes to the provisional, net, one-time charge for the year ended december 31, 2017, related to the tax act.
we recognized a new tax benefit in 2018 of $61 million related to the deduction for foreign derived intangible income enacted by the tax act, which reduced our effective income tax rate by 1.0 percentage point. we also recognized a tax benefit of $61 million in 2018, which reduced our effective income tax rate by 1.0 percentage point, from our change in a tax accounting method reflecting a 2012 court of federal claims decision, which held that the tax basis in certain assets should be increased and realized upon the assets' disposition.
the rates for all periods benefited from tax deductions for dividends paid to our defined contribution plans with an employee stock ownership plan feature, and the u.s. research and development (r&d) tax credit. the tax act repealed the u.s. manufacturing benefit for years after 2017. the u.s. manufacturing benefit for 2017 was insignificant, compared to a reduction of our effective tax rate by 2.5 percentage points for 2016. the 2017 benefit was reduced by $81 million because of our 2017 decision after enactment of the tax act to make accelerated contributions of cash in 2018 to our defined benefit pension plans. the r&d tax credit reduced our effective tax rate by 2.4 percentage points in 2018 and 2.2 percentage points in both 2017 and 2016. the rate for 2016 also benefited from the nontaxable gain recorded in connection with the consolidation of awe.
in addition, the rates for 2018, 2017, and 2016 benefited from tax benefits related to employee share-based payment awards, which are now recorded in earnings as income tax benefit or expense, effective with the adoption of an accounting standard update during 2016. accordingly, we recognized additional income tax benefits of $55 million, $106 million, and $152 million during the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, which reduced our effective income tax rate by 0.9 percentage points, 2.0 percentage points, and 3.2 percentage points.
future changes in tax laws could significantly impact our provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, our deferred tax asset and liability balances, and stockholders' equity. the amount of net deferred tax assets will change periodically based on several factors, including the measurement of our postretirement benefit plan obligations, actual cash contributions to our postretirement benefit plans, and future changes in tax laws.
33
net earnings from continuing operations we reported net earnings from continuing operations of $5.0 billion ($17.59 per share) in 2018, $1.9 billion ($6.50 per share) in 2017 and $3.7 billion ($12.08 per share) in 2016. both net earnings and earnings per share from continuing operations were affected by the factors mentioned above. earnings per share also benefited from a net decrease of approximately 3.0 million common shares outstanding from december 31, 2017 to december 31, 2018 as a result of share repurchases, partially offset by share issuance under our stock-based awards and certain defined contribution plans. from december 31, 2016 to december 31, 2017 earnings per share benefited from a decrease of approximately 5.0 million common shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases, partially offset by share issuance under our stock-based awards and certain defined contribution plans.
net earnings from discontinued operations we reported net earnings from discontinued operations related to the 2016 divestiture of the is&gs business of $73 million ($0.25 per share) in 2017 and $1.5 billion ($4.99 per share) in 2016. net earnings from discontinued operations in 2017 reflects certain post-closing adjustments, including final working capital and tax adjustments. net earnings from discontinued operations in 2016 included an initial net gain of approximately $1.2 billion recognized as a result of the divestiture of the is&gs business.
net earnings we reported net earnings of $5.0 billion ($17.59 per share) in 2018, $2.0 billion ($6.75 per share) in 2017 and $5.2 billion ($17.07 per share) in 2016.
business segment results of operations we operate in four business segments: aeronautics, mfc, rms and space. we organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered. the financial information in the following tables includes the results of businesses we have acquired from their respective dates of acquisition and excludes businesses included in discontinued operations (see "note 3 - acquisition and divestitures" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements) for all years presented. net sales of our business segments exclude intersegment sales as these activities are eliminated in consolidation.
operating profit of our business segments includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees because the operating activities of the equity method investees are closely aligned with the operations of our business segments. united launch alliance (ula), results of which are included in our space business segment, is one of our largest equity method investees. operating profit of our business segments excludes the fas/cas operating adjustment for our qualified defined benefit pension plans (described below); the adjustment from cas to the fas service cost component for all other postretirement benefit plans; expense for stock-based compensation; the effects of items not considered part of management's evaluation of segment operating performance, such as charges related to goodwill impairments (see "note 1 - significant accounting policies" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements) and significant severance and restructuring actions (see "note 15 - severance and restructuring charges" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements); gains or losses from significant divestitures (see "note 3 - acquisition and divestitures" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements); the effects of certain legal settlements; corporate costs not allocated to our business segments; and other miscellaneous corporate activities. these items are included in the reconciling item "unallocated items" between operating profit from our business segments and our consolidated operating profit.
our business segments' results of operations include pension expense only as calculated under u.s. government cost accounting standards, which we refer to as cas pension cost. we recover cas pension cost through the pricing of our products and services on u.s. government contracts and, therefore, the cas pension cost is recognized in each of our business segments' net sales and cost of sales. our consolidated operating profit in our consolidated financial statements must present the service cost component of fas pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense calculated in accordance with fas requirements under u.s. gaap. the operating portion of the net fas/cas operating adjustment represents the difference between the service cost component of fas pension expense and the cas pension cost recorded in our business segments' results of operations. the non-service fas pension and other postretirement benefit plan cost component is included in other non-operating expenses, net on our consolidated statement of earnings. as a result, to the extent that cas pension cost exceeds the service cost component of fas pension expense, which occurred for 2018, 2017 and 2016, we have a favorable fas/cas operating adjustment.

(a)   on august 24, 2016, our ownership interest in the awe joint venture increased from 33% to 51% and we were required to change our accounting for this investment from the equity method to consolidation. as a result of the increased ownership interest, we recognized a non-cash gain of $127 million at our space business segment, which increased net earnings from continuing operations by $104 million ($0.34 per share) in 2016. see "note 3 - acquisition and divestitures" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements for more information).

(a)   we record the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost as part of other non-operating expense, net in the consolidated statement of earnings. the non-service cost components in the table above relate only to our qualified defined benefit pension plans. we incurred total non-service costs for our qualified defined benefit pension plans in the table above, along with similar costs for our other postretirement benefit plans of $67 million, $109 million, and $123 million for the years ended 2018, 2017 and 2016.
we recover cas pension cost through the pricing of our products and services on u.s. government contracts and, therefore, recognize cas pension cost in each of our business segment's net sales and cost of sales. our consolidated financial statements must present fas pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense calculated in accordance with fas requirements under u.s. gaap. the operating portion of the net fas/cas pension adjustment represents the difference between the service cost component of fas pension expense and cas pension cost. the non-service fas pension cost component is included in other non-operating expense, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. the net fas/cas pension adjustment increases or decreases cas pension cost to equal total fas pension expense (both service and non-service).
the following segment discussions also include information relating to backlog for each segment. backlog was approximately $130.5 billion, $105.5 billion and $103.5 billion at december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. these amounts included both funded backlog (firm orders for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not yet been appropriated). backlog does not include unexercised options or task orders to be issued under indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contracts. funded backlog was approximately $86.4 billion at december 31, 2018.
management evaluates performance on our contracts by focusing on net sales and operating profit and not by type or amount of operating expense. consequently, our discussion of business segment performance focuses on net sales and operating profit, consistent with our approach for managing the business. this approach is consistent throughout the life cycle of our contracts, as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sales and operating profit and monitors performance on our contracts in a similar manner through their completion.
we regularly provide customers with reports of our costs as the contract progresses. the cost information in the reports is accumulated in a manner specified by the requirements of each contract. for example, cost data provided to a customer for a product would typically align to the subcomponents of that product (such as a wing-box on an aircraft) and for services would align to the type of work being performed (such as aircraft sustainment). our contracts generally allow for the recovery of costs in the pricing of our products and services. most of our contracts are bid and negotiated with our customers under circumstances in which we are required to disclose our estimated total costs to provide the product or service. this approach for negotiating contracts with our u.s. government customers generally allows for the recovery of our costs. we also may enter into long-term supply contracts for certain materials or components to coincide with the production schedule of certain products and to ensure their availability at known unit prices.
many of our contracts span several years and include highly complex technical requirements. at the outset of a contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of total costs to complete the contract. the estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements required under certain contracts with international customers). the initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding
36
the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract. conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase. all of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate.
we have a number of programs that are designated as classified by the u.s. government which cannot be specifically described. the operating results of these classified programs are included in our consolidated and business segment results and are subjected to the same oversight and internal controls as our other programs.
our net sales are primarily derived from long-term contracts for products and services provided to the u.s. government as well as fms contracted through the u.s. government. we recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. for performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts. for performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied.
changes in net sales and operating profit generally are expressed in terms of volume. changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in sales or operating profit resulting from varying production activity levels or service levels on individual contracts. volume changes in segment operating profit are typically based on the current profit booking rate for a particular contract.
in addition, comparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margins may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to complete and a reduction in the profit booking rate. increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. segment operating profit and margins may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items. favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; severance and restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions, which are excluded from segment operating results; reserves for disputes; asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets. segment operating profit and items such as risk retirements, reductions of profit booking rates or other matters are presented net of state income taxes.
as previously disclosed, we have a program, eadge-t, to design, integrate, and install an air missile defense command, control, communications, computers - intelligence (c4i) system for an international customer that has experienced performance matters and for which we have periodically accrued reserves. in 2017, we revised our estimated costs to complete the eadge-t contract as a consequence of ongoing performance matters and recorded an additional charge of $120 million ($74 million or $0.25 per share, after tax) at our rms business segment, which resulted in cumulative losses of approximately $260 million on this program. as of december 31, 2018, cumulative losses remained at approximately $260 million. we continue to monitor program requirements and our performance. at this time, we do not anticipate additional charges that would be material to our operating results or financial condition.
we have two commercial satellite programs, for the delivery of three satellites in total, to international customers at our space business segment, for which we have experienced performance issues related to the development and integration of a modernized lm 2100 satellite platform. these programs require the development of new satellite technology to enhance the lm 2100's power, propulsion and electronics, among other items. the enhanced lm 2100 satellite platform is expected to benefit other commercial and government satellite programs. we have periodically revised our estimated costs to complete these developmental commercial programs. we have recorded cumulative losses of approximately $380 million through december 31, 2018. in 2018, we recorded losses of approximately $75 million ($56 million, or $0.20 per share, after tax). while these losses reflect our estimated total losses on the programs, we will continue to incur general and administrative costs each period until we complete these programs. these programs remain developmental and further challenges in the delivery and integration of new satellite technology, anomalies discovered during system testing requiring repair or rework, further schedule delays and potential penalties could require that we record additional loss reserves which could be material to our operating results. we previously disclosed that, as we did not meet the july 2018 delivery requirement for two satellites, the customer could seek to exercise termination rights. one of the satellites has now been launched, eliminating this risk. as the other is expected to launch in the first half of 2019, we believe it unlikely that the customer will seek to do so. were the customer to seek to exercise a termination right and be successful in this effort, we would have to refund the payments we have received and pay certain penalties. on the third satellite, we currently anticipate delivery before the date upon which the customer could seek to exercise a termination right although we may have to pay certain penalties and have sought to address this possibility in our reserves.
37
we are responsible for designing, developing and installing an upgraded turret for the warrior capability sustainment program. in 2018, we revised our estimated costs to complete the program as a consequence of performance issues, and recorded a charge of approximately $85 million ($64 million, or $0.22 per share, after tax) at our mfc business segment, which resulted in cumulative losses of approximately $140 million on this program as of december 31, 2018. we may continue to experience issues related to customer requirements and our performance under this contract and have to record additional charges. however, based on the losses already recorded and our current estimate of the sales and costs to complete the program, at this time we do not anticipate that additional losses, if any, would be material to our operating results or financial condition.
our consolidated net adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other items, net of state income taxes, increased segment operating profit by approximately $1.9 billion in 2018, $1.6 billion in 2017 and $1.4 billion in 2016. the increase in consolidated net adjustments in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to increases in profit booking rate adjustments at our mfc, rms, and space business segments, partially offset by a decrease at our aeronautics business segment. the increase in our consolidated net adjustments in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increases in profit booking rate adjustments at our aeronautics and space business segments, partially offset by a decrease at our rms business segment. the consolidated net adjustments for 2018 are inclusive of approximately $900 million in unfavorable items, which include reserves for performance matters on the warrior capability sustainment program at mfc, various programs at rms, and commercial satellite programs at space. the consolidated net adjustments for 2017 are inclusive of approximately $800 million in unfavorable items, which include reserves for performance matters on the eadge-t contract, vertical launching system (vls) program and other programs at rms and on commercial satellite programs at space. the consolidated net adjustments for 2016 are inclusive of approximately $535 million in unfavorable items, which include reserves for performance matters on the eadge-t contract at rms and on commercial satellite programs at space.
aeronautics our aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. aeronautics' major programs include the f-35 lightning ii joint strike fighter, c‐130 hercules, f-16 fighting falcon and f-22 raptor. aeronautics' operating results included the following (in millions):

net sales                   $21,242             $19,410             $17,293

backlog at year-end         $55,601             $35,692             $34,999
2018 compared to 2017
aeronautics' net sales in 2018 increased $1.8 billion, or 9%, compared to 2017. the increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $1.5 billion for the f-35 program due to increased volume on production and sustainment, partially offset by lower volume on development activities; about $300 million for other programs due to higher volume (primarily adp); about $210 million for the f-16 program due to increased volume on modernization contracts; and about $110 million for the f-22 program due to increased sustainment volume. these increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $130 million for the c-130 program primarily due to lower volume on sustainment activities and about $130 million for the c-5 program due to lower volume as deliveries under the current production modernization program were completed in the third quarter of 2018.
aeronautics' operating profit in 2018 increased $96 million, or 4%, compared to 2017. operating profit increased approximately $250 million for the f-35 program due to increased volume on higher margin production contracts and new development activities and better performance on sustainment. this increase was partially offset by a decrease of about $65 million for the c-130 program due to lower risk retirements and lower sustainment volume; about $60 million for the f-16 program due to lower risk retirements; and about $35 million for the c-5 program due to lower risk retirements and lower production volume. adjustments not related to volume, primarily net profit booking rate adjustments, were about $175 million lower in 2018 compared to 2017.
2017 compared to 2016
aeronautics' net sales in 2017 increased $2.1 billion, or 12%, compared to 2016. the increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $2.0 billion for the f-35 program due to increased volume on production and sustainment; about $155 million for the c-130 program primarily due to increased production volume and due to aircraft configuration mix; and about
38
$95 million for the f-22 program due to higher volume on aircraft modernization programs. these increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $195 million for the c-5 program due to lower production volume.
aeronautics' operating profit in 2017 increased $331 million, or 18%, compared to 2016. operating profit increased approximately $300 million for the f-35 program due to increased volume on aircraft production and sustainment activities and higher risk retirements and about $85 million for the f-16 program due to higher risk retirements partially offset by lower volume on aircraft modernization programs. these increases were partially offset by a decrease of about $30 million due to lower equity earnings from an investee. adjustments not related to volume, primarily net profit booking rate adjustments, were about $245 million higher in 2017 compared to 2016.
backlog backlog increased in 2018 compared to 2017 and in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to higher orders on f-35 production and sustainment programs.
trends we currently expect aeronautics' 2019 net sales to increase in the high-single digit percentage range as compared to 2018 driven by the increased volume on the f-35 program. operating profit is also expected to increase in the high-single digit percentage range, resulting in comparable operating profit margins in 2019 as compared to 2018.

2018 compared to 2017
mfc's net sales in 2018 increased $1.2 billion, or 16%, compared to the same period in 2017. the increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $925 million for tactical and strike missile programs due to increased volume (primarily classified programs and precision fires); and about $185 million for sensors and global sustainment programs due to increased volume (primarily lantirn, sniper, and apache).
mfc's operating profit in 2018 increased $214 million, or 21%, compared to 2017. operating profit increased approximately $140 million for tactical and strike missile programs due to reserves which were recorded in 2017 but did not recur in 2018 (primarily joint air to ground missile (jagm)), higher risk retirements (primarily precision fires and hellfire) and higher volume (primarily precision fires); and about $50 million for sensors and global sustainment programs due to higher risk retirements and higher volume (primarily lantirn, sniper, and apache), after charges of approximately $85 million previously recorded in 2018 for performance matters on the warrior capability sustainment program. adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other items, were about $200 million higher in 2018 compared to 2017.
2017 compared to 2016
mfc's net sales in 2017 increased $493 million, or 7%, compared to 2016. the increase was attributable to higher net sales of approximately $205 million for integrated air and missile defense programs due to contract mix on certain programs (primarily pac-3) and increased volume on certain programs (primarily thaad); and about $135 million for sensors and global sustainment programs due to increased volume (primarily sof glss and lantirn and sniper); and about $110 million for tactical and strike missile programs due to product configuration mix (primarily precision fires) and increased volume (primarily classified programs).
39
mfc's operating profit in 2017 increased $30 million, or 3%, compared to 2016. operating profit increased about $85 million for integrated air and missile defense programs due to increased volume (primarily thaad), contract mix (primarily pac-3), and a reserve recorded in fiscal year 2016 for a contractual matter that did not recur in 2017; and about $85 million for sensors and global sustainment programs due to increased risk retirements and higher volume (primarily lantirn and sniper). these increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $120 million for tactical and strike missile programs due to lower risk retirements (primarily precision fires and hellfire) and the establishment of a reserve on a program. adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other items, were about $10 million higher in 2017 compared to 2016.
backlog backlog increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to higher orders on pac-3, precision fires, and other tactical missiles programs. backlog increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to higher orders on hellfire, precision fires and pac-3.
trends we currently expect mfc's net sales to increase in the low-double digit percentage range in 2019 as compared to 2018 driven by key contract awards in 2018 and higher volume in the tactical and strike missiles business. operating profit is expected to increase in the high-single digit percentage range in 2019 as compared to 2018 driven by the increase in sales volume. operating profit margin for 2019 is expected to be slightly lower than 2018 levels.
rotary and mission systems our rms business segment provides design, manufacture, service and support for a variety of military and commercial helicopters; ship and submarine mission and combat systems; mission systems and sensors for rotary and fixed-wing aircraft; sea and land-based missile defense systems; radar systems; the littoral combat ship (lcs); simulation and training services; and unmanned systems and technologies. in addition, rms supports the needs of government customers in cybersecurity and delivers communication and command and control capabilities through complex mission solutions for defense applications. rms' major programs include black hawk and seahawk helicopters, aegis combat system (aegis), lcs, ch-53k king stallion helicopter, vh-92a helicopter program, advanced hawkeye radar system, and the command, control, battle management and communications (c2bmc) contract. additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2017, we realigned certain programs within the rms business segment to align with changes in management structure. rms' operating results included the following (in millions):
2018                2017                2016
net sales                   $14,250             $13,663             $13,595

backlog at year-end         $31,320             $30,030             $29,029
2018 compared to 2017
rms' net sales in 2018 increased $587 million, or 4%, compared to 2017. the increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $525 million for iwss programs due to higher volume (primarily radar surveillance systems programs and multi mission surface combatant); and about $250 million for c6isr programs due to higher volume on multiple programs. these increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $270 million for sikorsky helicopter programs, which reflect lower volume for black hawk production, partially offset by higher volume for ch-53k king stallion development and for mission systems programs.
rms' operating profit in 2018 increased $400 million, or 44%, compared to 2017. operating profit increased approximately $185 million for c6isr programs due to charges of $120 million for performance matters on the eadge-t contract, recorded in 2017 but which did not recur in 2018, and due to higher risk retirements (primarily undersea systems programs); about $155 million for sikorsky helicopter programs due to better cost performance across the sikorsky portfolio and better cost performance on the multi-year ix contract; and about $105 million for iwss programs due to higher risk retirements and higher volume (primarily aegis). adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other items, were about $185 million higher in 2018 compared to 2017.
40
2017 compared to 2016
rms' net sales in 2017 increased $68 million, or 1%, compared to 2016. the increase was primarily attributable to approximately $85 million for training and logistics services programs due to higher volume; about $55 million for iwss programs due to higher volume (primarily aegis); and about $40 million for sikorsky helicopter programs due to certain adjustments recorded in 2016 required to account for the acquisition, partially offset by lower volume on certain helicopter programs. these increases were partially offset by a decrease of about $100 million for c6isr programs due to lower volume.
rms' operating profit in 2017 increased $57 million, or 7%, compared to 2016. operating profit increased about $120 million for sikorsky helicopter programs due to certain adjustments recorded in 2016 required to account for the acquisition; and about $30 million for iwss programs due to higher volume and increased risk retirements, partially offset by a $20 million charge for performance matters on the vertical launching system (vls) program. this increase was offset by a decrease of $105 million for c6isr programs primarily due to a net $95 million increase for charges for performance matters on the eadge-t contract. adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other items, were about $45 million lower in 2017 compared to 2016.
backlog backlog increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to higher orders on iwss and c6isr programs. backlog increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a new multi-year award at sikorsky.
trends we currently expect rms' net sales to be slightly above 2018 levels. operating profit is also expected to be slightly above 2018 levels resulting in similar operating profit margins in 2019 as compared to 2018.
space our space business segment is engaged in the research and development, design, engineering and production of satellites, strategic and defensive missile systems and space transportation systems. space provides network-enabled situational awareness and integrates complex space and ground-based global systems to help our customers gather, analyze, and securely distribute critical intelligence data. space is also responsible for various classified systems and services in support of vital national security systems. space's major programs include the trident ii d5 fleet ballistic missile (fbm), awe, orion multi-purpose crew vehicle (orion), space based infrared system (sbirs) and next generation overhead persistent infrared (next gen opir) system, global positioning system (gps) iii, advanced extremely high frequency (aehf), and the mobile user objective system (muos). operating profit for our space business segment includes our share of earnings for our investment in ula, which provides expendable launch services to the u.s. government. space's operating results included the following (in millions):
2018                2017                2016
net sales                    $9,808              $9,605              $9,613
operating profit              1,055                 980               1,288
operating margin               10.8   %            10.2   %            13.4   %
backlog at year-end         $22,184             $22,042             $25,226
2018 compared to 2017
space's net sales in 2018 increased $203 million, or 2%, compared to 2017. the increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $225 million for strategic and missile defense programs due to higher volume (primarily awe and fbm) and about $65 million for the orion program due to higher volume. these increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $70 million for commercial satellite programs due to lower volume and about $25 million for government satellite programs due to lower volume.
space's operating profit in 2018 increased $75 million, or 8%, compared to 2017. operating profit increased approximately $40 million for commercial satellite programs, which reflect a lower amount of charges recorded for performance matters on certain programs; and about $30 million for government satellite programs primarily due to higher volume and higher risk retirements for government satellite services. adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other items, were about $30 million higher in 2018 compared to 2017.
41
2017 compared to 2016
space's net sales in 2017 were comparable with 2016. the slight decrease was attributable to a decrease of approximately $300 million for space transportation programs due to a reduction in launch-related events; about $245 million for government satellite programs (primarily aehf and sbirs) due to lower volume; approximately $190 million across other programs (including the orion program) due to lower volume; and about $90 million for commercial satellite programs due to lower volume. these decreases were partially offset by an increase of approximately $810 million due to a full year of net sales from awe in 2017 compared to four months of sales in 2016, which we began consolidating during the third quarter of 2016.
space's operating profit in 2017 decreased $308 million, or 24%, compared to 2016. operating profit decreased $127 million due to the pre-tax gain recorded in 2016 related to the consolidation of awe; about $95 million for lower equity earnings from ula; about $30 million for space transportation programs due to a reduction in launch-related events; about $35 million for government satellite programs (primarily sbirs and aehf) due to a charge for performance matters and lower volume; and a net decrease of about $35 million related to charges recorded in 2017 for performance matters on certain commercial satellite programs. adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other items, were about $20 million higher in 2017 compared to 2016.
equity earnings total equity earnings recognized by space (primarily ula) represented approximately $210 million, $205 million and $325 million, or 20%, 21% and 25% of this business segment's operating profit during 2018, 2017 and 2016.
backlog backlog increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to new orders on government satellite programs, specifically next gen opir and gps iii. backlog decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to lower orders for government satellite programs, partially offset by higher orders on the orion program.
trends we currently expect space's 2019 net sales to be comparable to 2018 levels. operating profit in 2019 is expected to decrease in the low-double digit percentage range as compared to 2018 driven by lower equity earnings in 2019 compared to 2018. as a result, operating profit margin in 2019 is expected to decrease from 2018 levels.
liquidity and cash flows we have a balanced cash deployment strategy to enhance stockholder value and position ourselves to take advantage of new business opportunities when they arise. consistent with that strategy, we have continued to invest in our business, including capital expenditures, independent research and development and, selective business acquisitions and investments, while returning cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases, and managing our debt levels, maturities and interest rates and pension obligations.
we have generated strong operating cash flows, which have been the primary source of funding for our operations, capital expenditures, debt service and repayments, dividends, share repurchases and postretirement benefit plan contributions. our strong operating cash flows enabled our board of directors to approve two key cash deployment initiatives in september 2018. first, we increased our dividend rate in the fourth quarter by 10% to $2.20 per share. second, the board of directors approved a $1.0 billion increase to our share repurchase program. inclusive of this increase, the total remaining authorization for future common share repurchases under our program was $3.0 billion as of december 31, 2018.
we expect our cash from operations will continue to be sufficient to support our operations and anticipated capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. however, we expect to continue to issue commercial paper backed by our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility to manage the timing of cash flows. we also have additional access to credit markets, if needed, for liquidity or general corporate purposes, and letters of credit to support customer advance payments and for other trade finance purposes such as guaranteeing our performance on particular contracts. see our "capital structure, resources and other" section below for a discussion on available financial resources.
we made contributions of $5.0 billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2018, including required and discretionary contributions. as a result of these contributions, we do not expect to make contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2019. we funded these contributions in 2018 using a mix of cash on hand and commercial paper.
42
during 2016, we received a one-time, tax-free special cash payment of approximately $1.8 billion as a result of the divestiture of the is&gs business in the third quarter of 2016. we used the proceeds to repay $500 million of long-term notes at their scheduled maturity and paid $484 million in dividends with a portion of this cash. the remainder was used for share repurchases.
cash received from customers, either from the payment of invoices for work performed or for advances in excess of costs incurred, is our primary source of cash. we generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the customer. however, we may determine to fund customer programs ourselves pending government appropriations and are doing so with increased frequency. if we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on the contract, we may be at risk for reimbursement of the excess costs.
billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including the contract type. we generally bill and collect cash more frequently under cost-reimbursable contracts, which represent approximately 38% of the sales we recorded in 2018, as we are authorized to bill as the costs are incurred. a number of our fixed-price contracts may provide for performance-based payments, which allow us to bill and collect cash as we perform on the contract. the amount of performance-based payments and the related milestones are encompassed in the negotiation of each contract. the timing of such payments may differ from our incurrence of costs related to our contract performance, thereby affecting our cash flows.
the u.s. government has indicated that it would consider progress payments as the baseline for negotiating payment terms on fixed-price contracts, rather than performance-based payments. in contrast to negotiated performance-based payment terms, progress payment provisions correspond to a percentage of the amount of costs incurred during the performance of the contract. while the total amount of cash collected on a contract is the same, performance-based payments have had a more favorable impact on the timing of our cash flows. in addition, our cash flows may be affected if the u.s. government decides to withhold payments on our billings. while the impact of withholding payments delays the receipt of cash, the cumulative amount of cash collected during the life of the contract will not vary.
the majority of our capital expenditures for 2018 and those planned for 2019 are for equipment, facilities infrastructure and information technology. expenditures for equipment and facilities infrastructure are generally incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. for example, we have projects underway in our aeronautics business segment for facilities and equipment to support higher production of the f-35 combat aircraft, and we have projects underway to modernize certain of our facilities. we also incur capital expenditures for information technology to support programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure, inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use software.
the following table provides a summary of our cash flow information followed by a discussion of the key elements (in millions):
2018                         2017                2016

operating activities
2018 compared to 2017
net cash provided by operating activities decreased $3.3 billion in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to contributions of $5.0 billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2018 and an increase in cash used for working capital of $974 million, partially offset by an increase in net earnings and a decrease in income tax payments. the increase in cash used for working capital was largely driven by the timing of cash collections for the f-35 program and sikorsky helicopter programs. we received net income tax refunds of $41 million during the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to making net income tax payments of $1.1 billion during the year ended december 31, 2017. net refunds in 2018 were primarily the result a 2017 net operating loss carryback arising from our accelerated pension contributions. our effective income tax rate and cash tax payments in 2018 benefited
43
materially from the enactment of the tax act in 2017. we made interest payments of approximately $635 million and approximately $610 million during the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017.
2017 compared to 2016
net cash provided by operating activities increased $1.3 billion in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a decrease in cash used for working capital, a reduction in cash paid for income taxes and a reduction in cash paid for severance. the decrease in cash used for working capital was largely driven by timing of cash collections (primarily pac-3, thaad, lantirn and sniper, and sikorsky helicopter programs). we made net income tax payments of $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion during the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016. we made interest payments of approximately $610 million and approximately $600 million during the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016. in addition, cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december 31, 2016 included cash generated by is&gs of approximately $310 million as we retained this cash as part of the divestiture.
investing activities net cash used for investing activities decreased $72 million in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to approximately $105 million of cash received as part of the final settlement of net working capital in connection with the 2016 divestiture of our is&gs business and cash received for various other items, none of which were individually significant, partially offset by higher capital expenditures. net cash used for investing activities increased $162 million in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to higher capital expenditures and cash proceeds received in 2016 related to properties sold.
capital expenditures amounted to $1.3 billion in 2018, $1.2 billion in 2017 and $1.1 billion in 2016. the majority of our capital expenditures were for equipment and facilities infrastructure that generally are incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. we also incur capital expenditures for information technology to support programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure, inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use-software.
financing activities net cash used for financing activities decreased $153 million in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to $600 million of net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and a reduction in cash used for repurchases of common stock, partially offset by the repayment of long-term debt in 2018 and an increase in dividend payments.
net cash used for financing activities increased $848 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the receipt of a one-time special cash payment in 2016 from the divestiture of the is&gs business and higher dividend payments in 2017, partially offset by the repayment of long-term debt in 2016 and a reduction in cash used for repurchases of common stock.
in november 2018, we repaid $750 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 1.85% according to their scheduled maturities. in september 2016, we repaid $500 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 2.13% according to their scheduled maturities. in may 2016, we repaid $452 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 7.65% according to their scheduled maturities.
for additional information about our debt financing activities see the "capital structure, resources and other" discussion below and "note 10 - debt" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements.
we paid dividends totaling $2.3 billion ($8.20 per share) in 2018, $2.2 billion ($7.46 per share) in 2017 and $2.0 billion ($6.77 per share) in 2016. we paid quarterly dividends of $2.00 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2018 and $2.20 per share during the fourth quarter of 2018; $1.82 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2017 and $2.00 per share during the fourth quarter of 2017; and $1.65 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2016 and $1.82 per share during the fourth quarter of 2016.
we paid $1.5 billion, $2.0 billion and $2.1 billion to repurchase 4.7 million, 7.1 million and 8.9 million shares of our common stock during 2018, 2017 and 2016.

capital structure, resources and other at december 31, 2018, we held cash and cash equivalents of $772 million that was generally available to fund ordinary business operations without significant legal, regulatory, or other restrictions.
our outstanding debt, net of unamortized discounts and issuance costs, amounted to $14.1 billion at december 31, 2018 and is mainly in the form of publicly-issued notes that bear interest at fixed rates. as of december 31, 2018, we had $1.5 billion of short-term borrowings due within one year, of which approximately $900 million was composed of scheduled debt maturity due in november 2019 and approximately $600 million was composed of commercial paper borrowings with a weighted-average rate of 2.89%. during 2017, we borrowed and fully repaid amounts under our commercial paper programs. there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of december 31, 2017. as of december 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our debt and credit agreements.
we actively seek to finance our business in a manner that preserves financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing costs to the extent practicable. we review changes in financial market and economic conditions to manage the types, amounts and maturities of our indebtedness. we may at times refinance existing indebtedness, vary our mix of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt or seek alternative financing sources for our cash and operational needs.
on occasion, our customers may seek deferred payment terms to purchase our products. in connection with these transactions, we may, at our customer's request, enter into arrangements for the non-recourse sale of customer receivables to unrelated third-party financial institutions. for accounting purposes, these transactions are not discounted and are treated as a sale of receivables as we have no continuing involvement. the sale proceeds from the financial institutions are reflected in our operating cash flows on the statement of cash flows. we sold approximately $532 million in 2018 and $698 million in 2017 of customer receivables. there were no gains or losses related to sales of these receivables.
revolving credit facilities on august 24, 2018, we entered into a new $2.5 billion revolving credit facility (the 5-year facility) with various banks and concurrently terminated our existing $2.5 billion revolving credit facility. the 5‐year facility has an expiration date of august 24, 2023 and is available for general corporate purposes. the undrawn portion of the 5-year facility is also available to serve as a backup facility for the issuance of commercial paper. we may request and the banks may grant, at their discretion, an increase in the borrowing capacity under the 5-year facility of up to an additional $500 million. there were no borrowings outstanding under the 5-year facility as of december 31, 2018 and 2017.
borrowings under the 5-year facility are unsecured and bear interest at rates based, at our option, on a eurodollar rate or a base rate, as defined in the 5-year facility's agreement. each bank's obligation to make loans under the 5-year facility is subject to, among other things, our compliance with various representations, warranties, and covenants, including covenants limiting our ability and certain of our subsidiaries' ability to encumber assets and a covenant not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the 5‐year facility agreement.
long-term debt in november 2018, we repaid $750 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 1.85% according to their scheduled maturities.
in september 2017, we issued notes totaling approximately $1.6 billion with a fixed interest rate of 4.09% maturing in september 2052 (the new notes) in exchange for outstanding notes totaling approximately $1.4 billion with fixed interest rates ranging from 4.70% to 8.50% maturing 2029 to 2046 (the old notes). in connection with the exchange of principal, we paid a premium of $237 million, substantially all of which was in the form of new notes. this premium will be amortized as additional interest expense over the term of the new notes using the effective interest method. we may, at our option, redeem some or all of the new notes at any time by paying the principal amount of notes being redeemed plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest. interest on the new notes is payable on march 15 and september 15 of each year and began on march 15, 2018. the new notes are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
in september 2016, we repaid $500 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 2.13% according to their scheduled maturities. in may 2016, we repaid $452 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 7.65% according to their scheduled maturities. we also had related variable interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $450 million mature, which did not have a significant impact on net earnings or comprehensive income.
45
we have an effective shelf registration statement on form s-3 on file with the u.s. securities and exchange commission to provide for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities.
total equity our total equity was $1.4 billion at december 31, 2018 compared to a deficit of $776 million at december 31, 2017. the increase in equity was primarily due to net earnings of $5.0 billion, recognition of previously deferred postretirement benefit plan amounts of $1.2 billion, and employee stock activity of $406 million (including the impacts of stock option exercises, esop activity and stock-based compensation), partially offset by the annual december 31 re-measurement adjustment related to our postretirement benefit plans of $501 million, the repurchase of 4.7 million common shares for $1.5 billion; and dividends declared of $2.3 billion during the year.
as we repurchase our common shares, we reduce common stock for the $1 of par value of the shares repurchased, with the excess purchase price over par value recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. if additional paid-in capital is reduced to zero, we record the remainder of the excess purchase price over par value as a reduction of retained earnings. due to the volume of repurchases made under our share repurchase program, additional paid-in capital was reduced to zero, with the remainder of the excess purchase price over par value of $1.1 billion recorded as a reduction of retained earnings in 2018.
contractual commitments and off-balance sheet arrangements at december 31, 2018, we had contractual commitments to repay debt, make payments under operating leases, settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services and settle tax and other liabilities. capital lease obligations were not material. payments due under these obligations and commitments are as follows (in millions):
payments due by period total             less than1 year            years 2 and 3            years 4 and 5            after 5 years total debt (a)                             $15,299                  $1,500                    $2,150                     $625                  $11,024

(a)   total debt includes scheduled principal payments and the repayment of commercial paper and excludes approximately $13 million of debt issued by a consolidated joint venture as we do not guarantee the debt.
the table above excludes estimated minimum funding requirements for our qualified defined benefit pension plans. for additional information about our future minimum contributions for these plans, see "note 11 - postretirement benefit plans" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements. amounts related to other liabilities represent the contractual obligations for certain long-term liabilities recorded as of december 31, 2018. such amounts mainly include expected payments under non-qualified pension plans, environmental liabilities and deferred compensation plans.
purchase obligations related to operating activities include agreements and contracts that give the supplier recourse to us for cancellation or nonperformance under the contract or contain terms that would subject us to liquidated damages. such agreements and contracts may, for example, be related to direct materials, obligations to subcontractors and outsourcing arrangements. total purchase obligations for operating activities in the preceding table include approximately $45.9 billion related to contractual commitments entered into as a result of contracts we have with our u.s. government customers. the u.s. government generally would be required to pay us for any costs we incur relative to these commitments if they were to terminate the related contracts "for convenience" under the federal acquisition regulation (far), subject to available funding. this also would be true in cases where we perform subcontract work for a prime contractor under a u.s. government contract. the termination for convenience language also may be included in contracts with foreign, state and local governments. we also have contracts with customers that do not include termination for convenience provisions, including contracts with commercial customers.
purchase obligations in the preceding table for capital expenditures generally include facilities infrastructure, equipment and information technology.
46
we also may enter into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries. these agreements are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the foreign country by requiring the contractor to promote investment in the country. offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in-country projects and the purchase by third parties (e.g., our vendors) of supplies from in-country vendors. these agreements also may be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects, establishment of ventures with local companies and building or leasing facilities for in-country operations. we typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. the amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customer and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the original amount in the offset agreement. satisfaction of our offset obligations are included in the estimates of our total costs to complete the contract and may impact our sales, profitability and cash flows. our ability to recover investments on our consolidated balance sheet that we make to satisfy offset obligations is generally dependent upon the successful operation of ventures that we do not control and may involve products and services that are dissimilar to our business activities. at december 31, 2018, the notional value of remaining obligations under our outstanding offset agreements totaled approximately $12.1 billion, which primarily relate to our aeronautics, mfc and rms business segments, most of which extend through 2044. to the extent we have entered into purchase or other obligations at december 31, 2018 that also satisfy offset agreements, those amounts are included in the preceding table. offset programs usually extend over several years and may provide for penalties, estimated at approximately $1.5 billion at december 31, 2018, in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements. while historically we have not been required to pay material penalties, resolution of offset requirements are often the result of negotiations and subjective judgments.
in connection with our 50% ownership interest of ula, we and the boeing company (boeing) were previously required to provide ula an additional capital contribution if ula was unable to make required payments under its inventory supply agreement with boeing. in the fourth quarter of 2018, ula fully satisfied its obligations under this inventory supply agreement and we no longer have any obligation to provide ula an additional capital contribution under this agreement.
we have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds issued on our behalf by financial institutions, and directly issued guarantees to third parties primarily relating to advances received from customers and the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts. letters of credit and surety bonds generally are available for draw down in the event we do not perform. in some cases, we may guarantee the contractual performance of third parties such as venture partners. at december 31, 2018, we had the following outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and third-party guarantees (in millions):
commitment expiration by period total commitment             less than1 year             years2 and 3       years4 and 5             after 5 years standby letters of credit (a)              $2,284                      $1,302                      $707              $247                     $28

(a)   approximately $925 million of standby letters of credit in the "less than 1 year" category, $357 million in the "years 2 and 3" category and $24 million in the "years 4 and 5" category are expected to renew for additional periods until completion of the contractual obligation.
at december 31, 2018, third-party guarantees totaled $850 million, of which approximately 65% related to guarantees of contractual performance of ventures to which we currently are or previously were a party. this amount represents our estimate of the maximum amount we would expect to incur upon the contractual non-performance of the venture, venture partners or divested businesses. generally, we also have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a venture partner.
in determining our exposures, we evaluate the reputation, performance on contractual obligations, technical capabilities and credit quality of our current and former venture partners and the transferee under novation agreements all of which include a guarantee as required by the far. there were no material amounts recorded in our financial statements related to third-party guarantees or novation agreements.

critical accounting policies contract accounting / sales recognition the majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the u.s. government and international customers (including foreign military sales (fms) contracted through the u.s. government) for the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. we provide our products and services under fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts.
under fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. to the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. some fixed-price contracts have a performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance.
cost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. typically, we enter into three types of cost-reimbursable contracts: cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-plus-fixed-fee. cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within specified limits based on the customer's assessment of our performance against a predetermined set of criteria, such as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee, which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (i.e., incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (i.e., incentive based on performance). the fixed-fee in a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is negotiated at the inception of the contract and that fixed-fee does not vary with actual costs.
we account for a contract after it has been approved by all parties to the arrangement, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable.
we assess each contract at its inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contracts. when making this determination, we consider factors such as whether two or more contracts were negotiated and executed at or near the same time or were negotiated with an overall profit objective. if combined, we treat the combined contracts as a single contract for revenue recognition purposes.
we evaluate the products or services promised in each contract at inception to determine whether the contract should be accounted for as having one or more performance obligations. the products and services in our contracts are typically not distinct from one another due to their complex relationships and the significant contract management functions required to perform under the contract. accordingly, our contracts are typically accounted for as one performance obligation. in limited cases, our contracts have more than one distinct performance obligation, which occurs when we perform activities that are not highly complex or interrelated or involve different product lifecycles. significant judgment is required in determining performance obligations, and these decisions could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in a given period. we classify net sales as products or services on our consolidated statements of earnings based on the predominant attributes of the performance obligations.
we determine the transaction price for each contract based on the consideration we expect to receive for the products or services being provided under the contract. for contracts where a portion of the price may vary we estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount, which is included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. we analyze the risk of a significant revenue reversal and if necessary constrain the amount of variable consideration recognized in order to mitigate this risk.
at the inception of a contract we estimate the transaction price based on our current rights and do not contemplate future modifications (including unexercised options) or follow-on contracts until they become legally enforceable. contracts are often subsequently modified to include changes in specifications, requirements or price, which may create new or change existing enforceable rights and obligations. depending on the nature of the modification, we consider whether to account for the modification as an adjustment to the existing contract or as a separate contract. generally, modifications to our contracts are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration and interrelated tasks provided in the context of the contract. therefore, such modifications are accounted for as if they were part of the existing contract and recognized as a cumulative adjustment to revenue.
for contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated standalone selling price of the product or service underlying each performance obligation. the standalone selling price represents the amount we would sell the product or service to a customer on a standalone basis (i.e., not bundled with any other products or services). our contracts with the u.s. government, including fms contracts, are subject to the federal acquisition
48
regulations (far) and the price is typically based on estimated or actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin. as a result of these regulations, the standalone selling price of products or services in our contracts with the u.s. government and fms contracts are typically equal to the selling price stated in the contract.
for non-u.s. government contracts with multiple performance obligations, we evaluate whether the stated selling prices for the products or services represent their standalone selling prices. we primarily sell customized solutions unique to a customer's specifications. when it is necessary to allocate the transaction price to multiple performance obligations, we typically use the expected cost plus a reasonable profit margin to estimate the standalone selling price of each product or service. we occasionally sell standard products or services with observable standalone sales transactions. in these situations, the observable standalone sales transactions are used to determine the standalone selling price.
we recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. in determining when performance obligations are satisfied, we consider factors such as contract terms, payment terms and whether there is an alternative future use of the product or service. substantially all of our revenue is recognized over time as we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfers continuously to the customer. for contracts with the u.s. government and fms contracts, this continuous transfer of control of the work in process to the customer is supported by clauses in the contract that allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience, pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit, and take possession of any work in process. our non-u.s. government contracts, primarily international direct commercial contracts, typically do not include termination for convenience provisions. however, continuous transfer of control to our customer is supported and, if our customer were to terminate the contract for reasons other than our non-performance, we would have the right to recover damages which would include, among other potential damages, the right to payment for our work performed to date plus a reasonable profit to deliver products or services that do not have an alternative use to us.
for performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts. under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the performance obligation(s). for performance obligations to provide services to the customer, revenue is recognized over time based on costs incurred or the right to invoice method (in situations where the value transferred matches our billing rights) as our customer receives and consumes the benefits.
for performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied. this coincides with the point in time the customer obtains control of the product or service, which typically occurs upon customer acceptance or receipt of the product or service, given that we maintain control of the product or service until that point.
significant estimates and assumptions are made in estimating contract sales and costs, including the profit booking rate. at the outset of a long-term contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, as well as variable consideration, and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of sales and total costs to complete the contract. the estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead, general and administrative and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset or localization agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers). the initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract or may increase the variable consideration we expect to receive on the contract. conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase or our estimates of variable consideration we expect to receive decrease. all of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of the transaction price, a provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.
comparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method to measure progress towards completion. increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate. increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. segment operating
49
profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring charges, except for significant severance actions, which are excluded from segment operating results; reserves for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets.
other contract accounting considerations the majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the u.s. government. cost-based pricing is determined under the far. the far provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under u.s. government contracts. for example, costs such as those related to charitable contributions, interest expense and certain advertising and public relations activities are unallowable and, therefore, not recoverable through sales. in addition, we may enter into advance agreements with the u.s. government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters. for example, most of the environmental costs we incur for environmental remediation related to sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under far provisions and supporting advance agreements reached with the u.s. government.
we closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting. costs incurred and allocated to contracts are reviewed for compliance with u.s. government regulations by our personnel and are subject to audit by the defense contract audit agency.
postretirement benefit plans overview many of our employees participate in qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans, retiree medical and life insurance plans and other postemployment plans (collectively, postretirement benefit plans - see "note 11 - postretirement benefit plans" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements). the majority of our accrued benefit obligations relate to our qualified defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans. we recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the net funded status of these postretirement benefit plans under gaap as either an asset or a liability on our consolidated balance sheets. the gaap funded status represents the difference between the fair value of each plan's assets and the benefit obligation of the plan. the gaap benefit obligation represents the present value of the estimated future benefits we currently expect to pay to plan participants based on past service.
in june 2014, we amended certain of our qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans for non-union employees, comprising the majority of our benefit obligations, to freeze future retirement benefits. the calculation of retirement benefits under the affected defined benefit pension plans is determined by a formula that takes into account the participants' years of credited service and average compensation. the freeze takes effect in two stages. on january 1, 2016, the pay-based component of the formula used to determine retirement benefits was frozen so that future pay increases, annual incentive bonuses or other amounts earned for or related to periods after december 31, 2015 are not used to calculate retirement benefits. on january 1, 2020, the service-based component of the formula used to determine retirement benefits will also be frozen so that participants will no longer earn further credited service for any period after december 31, 2019. when the freeze is complete, the majority of our salaried employees will have transitioned to an enhanced defined contribution retirement savings plan.
additionally, in recent years we have taken other actions to mitigate the effect of our defined benefit pension plan on our financial results. for example, in december 2018, a lockheed martin qualified defined benefit pension plan purchased two contracts from insurance companies covering $2.6 billion of our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations.
first, in december 2018, an upfront cash payment of $810 million was made to an insurance company in exchange for a contract (referred to as a buy-in contract) that will reimburse the plan for all future benefit payments related to $770 million of the plan's outstanding defined benefit pension obligations for approximately 9,000 u.s. retirees and beneficiaries. on december 31, 2018, the approximately 9,000 retirees and beneficiaries and the buy-in contract were spun-off to another plan, with the buy-in contract the sole asset of that plan. under the arrangement, the plan remains responsible for paying the benefits for the covered retirees and beneficiaries and the insurance company will reimburse the plan as those benefits are paid. as a result, there is no net ongoing cash flow to the plan for the covered retirees and beneficiaries as the cost of providing the benefits is funded by the buy-in contract, effectively locking in the cost of the benefits and eliminating future volatility of the benefit obligation. the buy-in contract was purchased using assets from the pension trust and is accounted for at fair value as an investment of the trust. this transaction had no impact on our 2018 fas pension expense or cas pension cost. the difference of approximately $40 million between the amount paid to the insurance company and the amount of the pension obligations funded by the buy-in contract was recognized through the re-measurement of the related benefit obligations in other comprehensive loss in equity and will be amortized

to fas pension expense in future periods. we intend to begin the termination process for this plan during 2019, and at conclusion convert the buy-in contract to a buy-out contract, thus relieving us of liability for the pension obligations related to the covered population. the buy-out conversion, expected to occur as early as 2020, will require recognition of a settlement loss in earnings at that time, which we currently estimate will be approximately $350 million. a subsequent cash recovery is anticipated from the u.s. government.
also, during december 2018, we purchased an irrevocable group annuity contract from an insurance company (referred to as a buy-out contract) for $1.82 billion to settle $1.76 billion of our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations related to certain u.s. retirees and beneficiaries. the group annuity contract was purchased using assets from the pension trust. as a result of this transaction, we were relieved of all responsibility for these pension obligations and the insurance company is now required to pay and administer the retirement benefits owed to approximately 32,000 u.s. retirees and beneficiaries, with no change to the amount, timing or form of monthly retirement benefit payments. although the transaction was treated as a settlement for accounting purposes, we did not recognize a loss on the settlement in earnings associated with the transaction because total settlements during 2018 for this plan were less than this plan's service and interest cost in 2018. accordingly, the transaction had no impact on our 2018 fas pension expense or cas pension cost, and the difference of approximately $60 million between the amount paid to the insurance company and the amount of the pension obligations settled was recognized in other comprehensive loss and will be amortized to fas pension expense in future periods.
notwithstanding these actions, the impact of these plans and benefits on our earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record and the funded status for our postretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because those calculations are sensitive to funding levels as well as changes in several key economic assumptions, including interest rates, actual rates of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions including participant longevity and employee turnover, as well as the timing of cash funding.
actuarial assumptions the plan assets and benefit obligations are measured at the end of each year or more frequently, upon the occurrence of certain events such as a significant plan amendment, settlement or curtailment. the amounts we record are measured using actuarial valuations, which are dependent upon key assumptions such as discount rates, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, participant longevity, employee turnover and the health care cost trend rates for our retiree medical plans. the assumptions we make affect both the calculation of the benefit obligations as of the measurement date and the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in subsequent periods. when reassessing these assumptions we consider past and current market conditions and make judgments about future market trends. we also consider factors such as the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants.
we continue to use a single weighted average discount rate approach when calculating our consolidated benefit obligations related to our defined benefit pension plans resulting in 4.250% at december 31, 2018, compared to 3.625% at december 31, 2017 and 4.125% at december 31, 2016. we utilized a single weighted average discount rate of 4.250% when calculating our benefit obligations related to our retiree medical and life insurance plans at december 31, 2018, compared to 3.625% at december 31, 2017 and 4.00% at december 31, 2016. we evaluate several data points in order to arrive at an appropriate single weighted average discount rate, including results from cash flow models, quoted rates from long-term bond indices and changes in long-term bond rates over the past year. as part of our evaluation, we calculate the approximate average yields on corporate bonds rated aa or better selected to match our projected postretirement benefit plan cash flows.
we utilized an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.00% at december 31, 2018 compared to 7.50% for both december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2016. the long-term rate of return assumption represents the expected long-term rate of return on the funds invested or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the benefit obligations. this assumption is based on several factors including historical market index returns, the anticipated long-term allocation of plan assets, the historical return data for the trust funds, plan expenses and the potential to outperform market index returns. the difference between the long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption we select and the actual return on plan assets in any given year affects both the funded status of our benefit plans and the calculation of fas pension expense in subsequent periods. although the actual return in any specific year likely will differ from the assumption, the average expected return over a long-term future horizon should be approximately equal to the assumption. any variance in a given year should not, by itself, suggest that the assumption should be changed. patterns of variances are reviewed over time, and then combined with expectations for the future. as a result, changes in this assumption are less frequent than changes in the discount rate.
in both october 2018 and 2017, the society of actuaries published revised longevity assumptions that refined its prior studies. we used the revised assumptions indicating a shortened longevity in our december 31, 2018 and december 31, 2017 re-measurements of benefit obligation. the publications were a refinement to assumptions the society of actuaries published in previous years, beginning in 2014.

our stockholders' equity has been reduced cumulatively by $14.3 billion from the annual year-end measurements of the funded status of postretirement benefit plans. the cumulative non-cash, after-tax reduction primarily represents net actuarial losses resulting from declines in discount rates, investment losses and updated longevity. a market-related value of our plan assets, determined using actual asset gains or losses over the prior three year period, is used to calculate the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. these cumulative actuarial losses will be amortized to expense using the corridor method, where gains and losses are recognized to the extent they exceed 10% of the greater of plan assets or benefit obligations, over the average future service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans of approximately nine years as of december 31, 2018. this amortization period is expected to extend (approximately double) in 2020 when our non-union pension plans are completely frozen to use the average remaining life expectancy of the participants instead of average future service. during 2018, $1.2 billion of these amounts was recognized as a component of postretirement benefit plans expense and about $908 million is expected to be recognized as expense in 2019.
the discount rate and long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions we select at the end of each year are based on our best estimates and judgment. a change of plus or minus 25 basis points in the 4.250% discount rate assumption at december 31, 2018, with all other assumptions held constant, would have decreased or increased the amount of the qualified pension benefit obligation we recorded at the end of 2018 by approximately $1.4 billion, which would result in an after-tax increase or decrease in stockholders' equity at the end of the year of approximately $1.1 billion. if the 4.250% discount rate at december 31, 2018 that was used to compute the expected 2019 fas pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of fas pension expense projected for 2019 would be lower or higher by approximately $120 million. if the 7.00% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption at december 31, 2018 that was used to compute the expected 2019 fas pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of fas pension expense projected for 2019 would be lower or higher by approximately $85 million. each year, differences between the actual plan asset return and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets impacts the measurement of the following year's fas expense. every 100 basis points difference in return during 2018 between our negative actual rate of return of approximately 5.00% and our expected long-term rate of return of 7.50% impacted 2019 expected fas pension expense by approximately $20 million.
funding considerations we made contributions of $5.0 billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2018. there were no material contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2017 and 2016. funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in a manner consistent with cas and in accordance with the employee retirement income security act of 1974 (erisa), as amended by the pension protection act of 2006 (ppa).
contributions to our defined benefit pension plans are recovered over time through the pricing of our products and services on u.s. government contracts, including fms, and are recognized in our cost of sales and net sales. cas govern the extent to which our pension costs are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the u.s. government, including fms. we recovered $2.4 billion in 2018, $2.2 billion in 2017, and $2.0 billion in 2016 as cas pension costs. effective february 27, 2012 and fully transitioned to in 2017, the cas rules were revised to better align the recovery of pension costs, including prepayment credits, on u.s. government contracts with the minimum funding requirements of the ppa (referred to as cas harmonization).
pension cost recoveries under cas occur in different periods from when pension contributions are made under the ppa. amounts contributed in excess of the cas pension costs recovered under u.s. government contracts are considered to be prepayment credits under the cas rules. as of december 31, 2018, our prepayment credits were approximately $8.5 billion as compared to $6.3 billion at december 31, 2017. the increase was due to our cash contributions of $5.0 billion in 2018 compared to our $2.4 billion in cas recoveries. cash contributions in excess of the recovery of cas pension costs under u.s. government contracts increases the prepayment credit balance. the prepayment credit balance will also increase or decrease based on our actual investment return on plan assets.
trends we made contributions of $5.0 billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2018, including required and discretionary contributions. as a result of these contributions, we do not expect to make contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2019. we anticipate recovering approximately $2.6 billion of cas pension cost in 2019 allowing us to recuperate a portion of our cas prepayment credits.
we expect our 2019 fas pension expense to be $1.1 billion; compared to our 2018 fas pension expense of $1.4 billion. the impact of the higher fas discount rate of 4.25% for 2019 versus 3.625% for 2018 was partly offset by our negative actual rate of investment return in 2018 of approximately 5.00% versus our expected long-term rate of return of 7.50%. we expect a fas/cas
52
pension benefit in 2019 of about $1.5 billion, as compared to $1.0 billion in 2018, due to the lower 2019 fas pension expense and higher 2019 cas pension cost as compared to 2018.
environmental matters we are a party to various agreements, proceedings and potential proceedings for environmental remediation issues, including matters at various sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party (prp). at december 31, 2018 and 2017, the total amount of liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet for environmental matters was $864 million and $920 million. we have recorded receivables totaling $750 million and $799 million at december 31, 2018 and 2017 for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our products and services for agencies of the u.s. government, as discussed below. the amount that is expected to be allocated to our non-u.s. government contracts or that is determined to not be recoverable under u.s. government contracts has been expensed through cost of sales. we project costs and recovery of costs over approximately 20 years.
we enter into agreements (e.g., administrative consent orders, consent decrees) that document the extent and timing of some of our environmental remediation obligations. we also are involved in environmental remediation activities at sites where formal agreements either do not exist or do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligations. environmental remediation activities usually span many years, which makes estimating the costs more judgmental due to, for example, changing remediation technologies. to determine the costs related to clean up sites, we have to assess the extent of contamination, effects on natural resources, the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation, and evolving environmental standards.
we perform quarterly reviews of environmental remediation sites and record liabilities and receivables in the period it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated (see the discussion under "environmental matters" in "note 1 - significant accounting policies" and "note 14 - legal proceedings, commitments and contingencies" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements). we consider the above factors in our quarterly estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for environmental remediation activities, which results in the calculation of a range of estimates for a particular environmental remediation site. we do not discount the recorded liabilities, as the amount and timing of future cash payments are not fixed or cannot be reliably determined. given the required level of judgment and estimation, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change (e.g., a change in environmental standards or a change in our estimate of the extent of contamination).
under agreements reached with the u.s. government, most of the amounts we spend for environmental remediation are allocated to our operations as general and administrative costs. under existing u.s. government regulations, these and other environmental expenditures relating to our u.s. government business, after deducting any recoveries received from insurance or other prps, are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services. as a result, most of the expenditures we incur are included in our net sales and cost of sales according to u.s. government agreement or regulation, regardless of the contract form (e.g. cost-reimbursable, fixed-price). we continually evaluate the recoverability of our environmental receivables by assessing, among other factors, u.s. government regulations, our u.s. government business base and contract mix, our history of receiving reimbursement of such costs, and recent efforts by some u.s. government representatives to limit such reimbursement.
in addition to the proceedings and potential proceedings discussed above, california previously established a maximum level of the contaminant hexavalent chromium in drinking water of 10 parts per billion (ppb). this standard was successfully challenged by the california manufacturers and technology association (cmta) for failure to conduct the required economic feasibility analysis. in response to the court's ruling, the state water resources control board (state board), a branch of the california environmental protection agency, withdrew the hexavalent chromium standard from the published regulations, leaving only the 50 ppb standard for total chromium. the state board has indicated it will work to re-establish a hexavalent chromium standard. if the standard for hexavalent chromium is re‐established at 10 ppb or above, it will not have a material impact on our existing environmental remediation costs in california. further, the u.s. environmental protection agency (u.s. epa) is considering whether to regulate hexavalent chromium.
california is also reevaluating its existing drinking water standard of 6 ppb for perchlorate, and the u.s. epa is taking steps to regulate perchlorate in drinking water. if substantially lower standards are adopted, in either california or at the federal level for perchlorate or for hexavalent chromium, we expect a material increase in our estimates for environmental liabilities and the related assets for the portion of the increased costs that are probable of future recovery in the pricing of our products and services for the u.s. government. the amount that would be allocable to our non-u.s. government contracts or that is determined not to be recoverable under u.s. government contracts would be expensed, which may have a material effect on our earnings in any particular interim reporting period.
as disclosed above, we may record changes in the amount of environmental remediation liabilities as a result of our quarterly reviews of the status of our environmental remediation sites, which would result in a change to the corresponding environmental
53
remediation receivables and a charge to earnings. for example, if we were to determine that the liabilities should be increased by $100 million, the corresponding receivables would be increased by approximately $87 million, with the remainder recorded as a charge to earnings. this allocation is determined annually, based upon our existing and projected business activities with the u.s. government.
we cannot reasonably determine the extent of our financial exposure at all environmental remediation sites with which we are involved. there are a number of former operating facilities we are monitoring or investigating for potential future environmental remediation. in some cases, although a loss may be probable, it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the amount of any obligation for remediation activities because of uncertainties (e.g., assessing the extent of the contamination). during any particular quarter, such uncertainties may be resolved, allowing us to estimate and recognize the initial liability to remediate a particular former operating site. the amount of the liability could be material. upon recognition of the liability, a portion will be recognized as a receivable with the remainder charged to earnings, which may have a material effect in any particular interim reporting period.
if we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a prp, we expect that the actual costs of environmental remediation will be shared with other liable prps. generally, prps that are ultimately determined to be responsible parties are strictly liable for site remediation and usually agree among themselves to share, on an allocated basis, the costs and expenses for environmental investigation and remediation. under existing environmental laws, responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and, therefore, we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation. in the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation, the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of cost recovery or contribution from the other prps. the amounts we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental costs we have incurred through insurance or from other prps, which we are required to pursue by agreement and u.s. government regulation.
goodwill the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses.
our goodwill balance was $10.8 billion at december 31, 2018 and 2017. we perform an impairment test of our goodwill at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. such events or changes in circumstances may include a significant deterioration in overall economic conditions, changes in the business climate of our industry, a decline in our market capitalization, operating performance indicators, competition, reorganizations of our business, u.s. government budget restrictions or the disposal of all or a portion of a reporting unit. our goodwill has been allocated to and is tested for impairment at a level referred to as the reporting unit, which is our business segment level or a level below the business segment. the level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires us to determine whether the operations below the business segment constitute a self-sustaining business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results.
we may use both qualitative and quantitative approaches when testing goodwill for impairment. for selected reporting units where we use the qualitative approach, we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment. based on that qualitative evaluation, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further evaluation is necessary. otherwise we perform a quantitative impairment test. we perform quantitative tests for most reporting units at least once every three years. however, for certain reporting units we may perform a quantitative impairment test every year.
to perform the quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. if the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. we generally estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of a discounted cash flow (dcf) analysis and market-based valuation methodologies such as comparable public company trading values and values observed in recent business acquisitions. determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant comparable public company earnings multiples and relevant transaction multiples. the cash flows employed in the dcf analysis are based on our best estimate of future sales, earnings and cash flows after considering factors such as general market conditions, u.s. government budgets, existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, changes in working capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance. the discount rates utilized in the dcf analysis are based on the respective reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital, which takes into account the relative weights of each component of capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent
54
in future cash flows of the respective reporting unit. the carrying value of each reporting unit includes the assets and liabilities employed in its operations, goodwill and allocations of amounts held at the business segment and corporate levels.
in the fourth quarter of 2018, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting units. the results of that test indicated that for each of our reporting units, including sikorsky, no impairment existed. as of the date of our annual impairment test, the carrying value of our sikorsky reporting unit includes goodwill of $2.7 billion and exceeds its fair value by a margin of approximately 20%. the carrying value and fair value of our sikorsky reporting unit is closely aligned. therefore, any business deterioration, changes in timing of orders, contract cancellations or terminations, or negative changes in market factors could cause our sales, earnings and cash flows to decline below current projections. similarly, market factors utilized in the impairment analysis, including long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant comparable public company earnings multiples and transaction multiples, could negatively impact the fair value of our reporting units. based on our assessment of these circumstances, we have determined that goodwill at our sikorsky reporting unit is at risk for impairment should there be deterioration of projected cash flows, negative changes in market factors or a significant increase in the carrying value of the reporting unit.
impairment assessments inherently involve management judgments regarding a number of assumptions such as those described above. due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit's fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill, differences in assumptions could have a material effect on the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period.
intangible assets intangible assets from acquired businesses are recognized at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition and consist of customer programs, trademarks, customer relationships, technology and other intangible assets. customer programs include values assigned to major programs of acquired businesses and represent the aggregate value associated with the customer relationships, contracts, technology and trademarks underlying the associated program and are amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value, which ranges from nine to 20 years. acquired intangibles deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual impairment testing. this testing compares carrying value to fair value and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. finite-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over the applicable useful lives, ranging from three to 20 years, based on the nature of the asset and the underlying pattern of economic benefit as reflected by future net cash inflows. we perform an impairment test of finite-lived intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may be impaired. should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a finite-lived intangible may be impaired, the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group would be compared to the asset group's carrying value. should the asset group's carrying amount exceed the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows, we would determine the fair value of the asset group and record an impairment loss in net earnings.
the carrying value of our sikorsky business includes an indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset of $887 million as of december 31, 2018. in the fourth quarter of 2018, we performed the annual impairment test for the sikorsky indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset and the results indicated that no impairment existed. as of the date of our annual impairment test, the sikorsky trademark exceeded its carrying value by a margin of approximately 5%. additionally, our sikorsky business has finite-lived customer program intangible assets with carrying values of $2.4 billion as of december 31, 2018. any business deterioration, contract cancellations or terminations, or negative changes in market factors could cause our sales to decline below current projections. based on our assessment of these circumstances, we have determined that our sikorsky intangible assets are at risk for impairment should there be any business deterioration, contract cancellations or terminations, or negative changes in market factors.
recent accounting pronouncements see "note 1 - significant accounting policies" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements (under the caption "recent accounting pronouncements").
55
item  7a.    quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain active relationships with a broad and diverse group of u.s. and international financial institutions. we believe that they provide us with sufficient access to the general and trade credit we require to conduct our business. we continue to closely monitor the financial market environment and actively manage counterparty exposure to minimize the potential impact from adverse developments with any single credit provider while ensuring availability of, and access to, sufficient credit resources.
our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market prices on certain equity securities. our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed-rate long-term debt and commercial paper. the estimated fair value of our outstanding debt was $15.4 billion at december 31, 2018 and the outstanding principal amount was $15.3 billion, excluding unamortized discounts and issuance costs of $1.2 billion. a 10% change in the level of interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our outstanding debt at december 31, 2018.
we use derivative instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. we do not enter into or hold derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. we transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates. we enter into foreign currency hedges such as forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change. our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the british pound sterling, the euro, the canadian dollar and the australian dollar. these contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. as a result, we do not have material foreign currency exposure, including exposure to the pound sterling or euro should there be material foreign currency fluctuations due to the united kingdom departing from the european union (commonly referred to as brexit). we designate foreign currency hedges as cash flow hedges. we also are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our borrowing activities. for fixed rate borrowings, we may use variable interest rate swaps, effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings indexed to libor in order to reduce the amount of interest paid. these swaps are designated as fair value hedges. for variable rate borrowings, we may use fixed interest rate swaps, effectively converting variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings in order to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on earnings. these swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. we also may enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting, which are intended to mitigate certain economic exposures.
the classification of gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of derivatives is dependent on our intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation. adjustments to reflect changes in fair values of derivatives attributable to the effective portion of hedges are either reflected in earnings and largely offset by corresponding adjustments to the hedged items or reflected net of income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are attributable to the ineffective portion of the hedges, or of derivatives that are not considered to be highly effective hedges, if any, are immediately recognized in earnings. the aggregate notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swaps at december 31, 2018 and 2017 was $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion. the aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedges at december 31, 2018 and 2017 was $3.5 billion and $4.1 billion. at december 31, 2018 and 2017, the net fair value of our derivative instruments was not material (see "note 16 - fair value measurements" included in our notes to consolidated financial statements). a 10% unfavorable exchange rate movement of our foreign currency contracts would not have a material impact on the aggregate net fair value of such contracts or our consolidated financial statements. additionally, as we enter into foreign currency contract to hedge foreign currency exposure on underlying transactions we believe that any movement on our foreign currency contracts would be offset by movement on the underlying transactions and, therefore, when taken together do not create material risk.
we evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into agreements with those deemed to have acceptable credit risk at the time the agreements are executed. our foreign currency exchange hedge portfolio is diversified across several banks. we periodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties. we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
we maintain a separate trust that includes investments to fund certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. as of december 31, 2018, investments in the trust totaled $1.3 billion and are reflected at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet in other noncurrent assets. the trust holds investments in marketable equity securities and fixed-income securities that are exposed to price changes and changes in interest rates. a portion of the liabilities associated with the deferred compensation plans supported by the trust is also impacted by changes in the market price of our common stock and certain market indices. changes in the value of the liabilities have the effect of partially offsetting the impact of changes in the value of the trust. both the change in the fair value of the trust and the change in the value of the liabilities are recognized on our consolidated statements of earnings in other unallocated, net and were not material for the year ended december 31, 2018.

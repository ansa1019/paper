item 1a.   risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report.
our business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by the covid-19 pandemic the covid-19 pandemic and the resulting containment measures have caused economic and financial disruptions globally, including in most of the regions in which we sell our products and services and conduct our business operations. in the second half of fiscal 2020, the covid-19 pandemic had an impact on our financial results and business operations, with a significant impact in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 on our supply chain where we saw manufacturing challenges and component constraints. the magnitude and duration of the disruption, its continuing impact on us, and resulting decline in global business activity is uncertain. these disruptions include the unprecedented actions taken to try to contain the pandemic such as travel bans and restrictions, business closures, and social distancing measures, such as quarantines and shelter-in-place orders.
the covid-19 pandemic and the responsive measures taken in many countries have adversely affected and could in the future materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. shelter-in-place orders and other measures, including work-from-home and other policies implemented to protect workers, has and could in the future impact our supply chain. vendors may be under pressure to allocate product to certain customers for business, regulatory or political reasons, and/or demand changes in agreed pricing as a condition of supply. such disruptions may continue, or worsen, in the future. in addition, current and future restrictions or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability of air transport, port closures, and increased border controls or closures, can also impact our ability to meet customer demand and could materially adversely affect us. our customers have also experienced, and may continue to experience, disruptions in their operations, which can result in delayed, reduced, or canceled orders, and increased collection risks, and which may adversely affect our results of operations. the covid-19 pandemic may also result in long-term changes in customer needs for our products and services in various sectors, along with it-
related capital spending reductions, or shifts in spending focus, that could materially adversely affect us if we are unable to adjust our product and service offerings to match customer needs.
the recent shift to a remote working environment also creates challenges. for example, governmental lockdowns, restrictions or new regulations has and could in the future impact the ability of our employees and vendors to work with the same speed and productivity in certain areas, even as other areas do not see negative impact. the extent and/or duration of ongoing workforce restrictions and limitations could impact our ability to enhance, develop and support existing products and services, and hold product sales and marketing events to the extent we were able to previously. in addition, malefactors are seeking to use the covid-19 pandemic to launch new cyber-attacks. see the risk factors below entitled "cyber-attacks, data breaches or malware may disrupt our operations, harm our operating results and financial condition, and damage our reputation, and cyber-attacks or data breaches on our customers' networks, or in cloud-based services provided by or enabled by us, could result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business" and "vulnerabilities and critical security defects, prioritization decisions regarding remedying vulnerabilities or security defects, failure of third party providers to remedy vulnerabilities or security defects, or customers not deploying security releases or deciding not to upgrade products, services or solutions could result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business."
the covid-19 pandemic has also led to increased disruption and volatility in capital markets and credit markets. the pandemic and resulting economic uncertainty could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future. the inputs into certain of our judgments, assumptions, and estimates considered the economic implications of the covid-19 pandemic on our critical and significant accounting estimates. the actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates. as the covid-19 pandemic continues to develop, many of our estimates could require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. as events continue to evolve our estimates may change materially in future periods.
we are continuing to monitor the pandemic and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities. the extent of the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors outside our control, including, without limitation, the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy. potential negative impacts of these external factors include, but are not limited to, material adverse effects on demand for our products and services; our supply chain and sales and distribution channels; collectability of customer accounts; our ability to execute strategic plans; impairments; and our profitability and cost structure. to the extent the covid-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operations and financial condition, it may also have the effect of exacerbating the other risks discussed in this "risk factors" section.
our operating results may fluctuate in future periods, which may adversely affect our stock price our operating results have been in the past, and will continue to be, subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors, some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuations in an uncertain global economic environment. these factors include:
•   fluctuations in demand for our products and services, especially with respect to service providers and internet businesses, in part due to changes in the global economic environment
•   changes in sales and implementation cycles for our products and reduced visibility into our customers' spending plans and associated revenue
•   our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels and purchase commitments
•   price and product competition in the communications and networking industries, which can change rapidly due to technological innovation and different business models from various geographic regions
•   the overall movement toward industry consolidation among both our competitors and our customers
•   the introduction and market acceptance of new technologies and products, and our success in new and evolving markets, and in emerging technologies, as well as the adoption of new standards
•   the transformation of our business to deliver more software and subscription offerings where revenue is recognized over time
•   variations in sales channels, product costs, mix of products sold, or mix of direct sales and indirect sales
•   the timing, size, and mix of orders from customers
•   manufacturing and customer lead times
•   fluctuations in our gross margins, and the factors that contribute to such fluctuations, as described below
•   the ability of our customers, channel partners, contract manufacturers and suppliers to obtain financing or to fund capital expenditures, especially during a period of global credit market disruption or in the event of customer, channel partner, contract manufacturer or supplier financial problems
•   actual events, circumstances, outcomes, and amounts differing from judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in determining the values of certain assets (including the amounts of related valuation allowances), liabilities, and other items reflected in our consolidated financial statements
•   how well we execute on our strategy and operating plans and the impact of changes in our business model that could result in significant restructuring charges
•   our ability to achieve targeted cost reductions
•   benefits anticipated from our investments in engineering, sales, service, and marketing
•   changes in tax laws or accounting rules, or interpretations thereof as a consequence, operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict, and, therefore, prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods. any of the foregoing factors, or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition that could adversely affect our stock price.
our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment challenging economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed, and may continue to contribute, to slowdowns in the communications and networking industries at large, as well as in specific segments and markets in which we operate, resulting in:
•   reduced demand for our products as a result of continued constraints on it-related capital spending by our customers, particularly service providers, and other customer markets as well
•   increased price competition for our products, not only from our competitors but also as a consequence of customers disposing of unutilized products
•   risk of excess and obsolete inventories
•   risk of supply constraints
•   risk of excess facilities and manufacturing capacity
•   higher overhead costs as a percentage of revenue and higher interest expense the global macroeconomic environment continues to be challenging and inconsistent, and is being significantly impacted by the covid-19 pandemic. during fiscal 2020, we continued to see a more broad-based weakening in the global macroeconomic environment which impacted our commercial and enterprise markets. we also experienced continuing weakness in the service provider market and emerging countries, and we expect ongoing uncertainty in these markets. additionally, instability in the global credit markets, the impact of uncertainty regarding global central bank monetary policy, the instability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world including as a result of the united kingdom "brexit" withdrawal from the european union, the current economic challenges in china, including global economic ramifications of chinese economic difficulties, and other disruptions may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions. if global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in key markets, remain uncertain or deteriorate further, we may experience material impacts on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment. for example, emerging countries in the aggregate experienced a decline in product orders in fiscal 2020, and in certain prior periods.
in addition, reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the u.s. government could affect customers' perception of the products of it companies which design and manufacture products in the united states. trust and confidence in us as an it supplier is critical to the development and growth of our markets. impairment of that trust, or foreign regulatory actions taken in response to reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the u.s. government, could affect the demand for our products from customers outside of the united states and could have an adverse effect on our operating results.
we have been investing and expect to continue to invest in key priority and growth areas as well as maintaining leadership in infrastructure platforms and in services, and if the return on these investments is lower or develops more slowly than we expect, our operating results may be harmed we expect to realign and dedicate resources into key priority and growth areas, such as security and applications, while also focusing on maintaining leadership in infrastructure platforms and in services. however, the return on our investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect. if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments (including if our selection of areas for investment does not play out as we expect), or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, our operating results may be adversely affected.
our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict, and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results as a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report, our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict, especially in light of a challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment, the significant impacts of the covid-19 pandemic, and related market uncertainty. during fiscal 2020, we continued to see a more broad-based weakening in the global macroeconomic environment which impacted our commercial and enterprise markets. we also experienced continuing weakness in the service provider market and emerging countries, and we expect ongoing uncertainty in these markets.
our revenue may grow at a slower rate than in past periods or decline as it did during fiscal 2020, and in certain prior periods on a year-over-year basis. our ability to meet financial expectations could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in some of our past quarters recurs in future periods. we have experienced periods of time during which shipments have exceeded net bookings or manufacturing issues have delayed shipments, leading to nonlinearity in shipping patterns. in addition to making it difficult to predict revenue for a particular period, nonlinearity in shipping can increase costs, because irregular shipment patterns result in periods of underutilized capacity and periods in which overtime expenses may be incurred, as well as in potential additional inventory management-related costs. in addition, to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future, and particularly in periods in which our contract manufacturers are operating at higher levels of capacity, it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters occur and are not remediated within the same quarter.
the timing of large orders can also have a significant effect on our business and operating results from quarter to quarter, primarily in the united states and in emerging countries. from time to time, we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue. the timing of such orders is difficult to predict, and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes in revenue. as a result, our operating results could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue.
inventory management remains an area of focus. we have experienced longer than normal manufacturing lead times in the past which have caused some customers to place the same order multiple times within our various sales channels and to cancel the duplicative orders upon receipt of the product, or to place orders with other vendors with shorter manufacturing lead times. such multiple ordering (along with other factors) or risk of order cancellation may cause difficulty in predicting our revenue and, as a result, could impair our ability to manage parts inventory effectively. in addition, our efforts to improve manufacturing lead-time performance may result in more variability and less predictability in our revenue and operating results. in addition, when facing component supply-related challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations, which in turn contribute to an increase in purchase commitments. increases in our purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our products is less than our expectations.
we plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels. these expenses and the impact of long-term commitments are relatively fixed in the short term. a shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to short-term business changes.
any of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results.
we expect gross margin to vary over time, and our level of product gross margin may not be sustainable although our product gross margin increased in fiscal 2020, our level of product gross margins declined in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and have declined in certain prior periods on a year-over-year basis, and could decline in future periods due to adverse impacts from various factors, including:
•   changes in customer, geographic, or product mix, including mix of configurations within each product group
•   introduction of new products, including products with price-performance advantages, and new business models including the transformation of our business to deliver more software and subscription offerings
•   our ability to reduce production costs
•   entry into new markets or growth in lower margin markets, including markets with different pricing and cost structures, through acquisitions or internal development
•   sales discounts
•   increases in material, labor or other manufacturing-related costs, which could be significant especially during periods of supply constraints such as those impacting the market for memory components
•   excess inventory and inventory holding charges
•   obsolescence charges
•   changes in shipment volume
•   the timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals
•   increased cost (including those caused by tariffs), loss of cost savings or dilution of savings due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to inventory holding periods if parts ordering does not correctly anticipate product demand or if the financial health of either contract manufacturers or suppliers deteriorates
•   lower than expected benefits from value engineering
•   increased price competition, including competitors from asia, especially from china
•   changes in distribution channels
•   increased warranty costs
•   increased amortization of purchased intangible assets, especially from acquisitions
•   how well we execute on our strategy and operating plans changes in service gross margin may result from various factors such as changes in the mix between technical support services and advanced services, as well as the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals and the addition of personnel and other resources to support higher levels of service business in future periods.
sales to the service provider market are especially volatile, and weakness in orders from this industry may harm our operating results and financial condition sales to the service provider market have been characterized by large and sporadic purchases, especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain other infrastructure platforms and applications products, in addition to longer sales cycles. service provider product orders decreased during fiscal 2020 and in certain prior periods, and at various times in the past, including in recent quarters, we have experienced significant weakness in product orders from service providers. product orders from the service provider market could continue to decline and, as has been the case in the past, such weakness could persist over extended periods of time given fluctuating market conditions. sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructures; the availability of funding; and the extent to which service providers are affected by regulatory, economic, and business conditions in the country of operations. weakness in orders from this industry, including as a result of any slowdown in capital expenditures by service providers (which may be more prevalent during a global economic downturn, or periods of economic, political or regulatory uncertainty), could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. such slowdowns may continue or recur in future periods. orders from this industry could decline for many reasons other than the competitiveness of our products and services within their respective markets. for example, in the past, many of our service provider customers have been materially and adversely affected by slowdowns in the general economy, by overcapacity, by changes in the service provider market, by regulatory developments, and by constraints on capital availability, resulting in business failures and substantial reductions in spending and expansion plans. these conditions have materially harmed our business and operating results in the past, and some of these or other conditions in the service provider market could affect our business and operating results in any future period. finally, service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles; require a broader range of services, including design services; demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks; often require acceptance provisions, which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition; and expect financing from vendors. all these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers.
disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins if we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly, or if our distributors' financial condition or operations weaken, our revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected.
a substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners, and the remainder is sold through direct sales. our channel partners include systems integrators, service providers, other resellers, and distributors. systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation, technical support, professional services, and other support services in addition to network equipment sales. systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution, and a number of service providers are also systems integrators. distributors stock inventory and typically sell to systems integrators, service providers, and other resellers. we refer to sales through distributors as our two-tier system of sales to the end customer. these distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory, receive credits for changes in selling prices, and participate in various cooperative marketing programs. if sales through indirect channels increase, this may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and, to a degree, the timing of orders from our customers.
historically, we have seen fluctuations in our gross margins based on changes in the balance of our distribution channels. although variability to date has not been significant, there can be no assurance that changes in the balance of our distribution model in future periods would not have an adverse effect on our gross margins and profitability.
some factors could result in disruption of or changes in our distribution model, which could harm our sales and margins, including the following:
•   we compete with some of our channel partners, including through our direct sales, which may lead these channel partners to use other suppliers that do not directly sell their own products or otherwise compete with them
•   some of our channel partners may demand that we absorb a greater share of the risks that their customers may ask them to bear
•   some of our channel partners may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes and challenges in business conditions
•   revenue from indirect sales could suffer if our distributors' financial condition or operations weaken in addition, we depend on our channel partners globally to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. to the extent that they fail to do so, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. further, sales of our products outside of agreed territories can result in disruption to our distribution channels.
the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive, which could adversely affect our achievement of revenue growth the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change, converging technologies, and a migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages. these market factors represent a competitive threat to us. we compete with numerous vendors in each product category. the overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase. also, the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in newer product areas, and in key priority and growth areas. for example, as products related to network programmability, such as software defined networking (sdn) products, become more prevalent, we expect to face increased competition from companies that develop networking products based on commoditized hardware, referred to as "white box" hardware, to the extent customers decide to purchase those product offerings instead of ours. in addition, the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market.
as we continue to expand globally, we may see new competition in different geographic regions. in particular, we have experienced price-focused competition from competitors in asia, especially from china, and we anticipate this will continue. for information regarding our competitors, see the section entitled "competition" contained in item 1. business of this report.
some of our competitors compete across many of our product lines, while others are primarily focused in a specific product area. barriers to entry are relatively low, and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed. in addition, some of our competitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than we do. as we expand into new markets, we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors, including existing companies with strong technological, marketing, and sales positions in those markets. we also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products. companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas, and in our view this trend may increase.
for example, the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies, including computing, networking, storage, and software, that previously were segregated. due to several factors, including the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors, asics offering advanced services, standards based protocols, cloud computing and virtualization, the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple, previously independent, technology segments. also, some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions, or announced new strategic alliances, designed to position them to provide end-to-end technology solutions for the enterprise data center. as a result of all of these developments, we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies, including competition from entities that are among our long-term strategic alliance partners. companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us.
the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include:
•   the ability to sell successful business outcomes
•   the ability to provide a broad range of networking and communications products and services
•   product performance
•   price
•   the ability to introduce new products, including providing continuous new customer value and products with price-performance advantages
•   the ability to reduce production costs
•   the ability to provide value-added features such as security, reliability, and investment protection
•   conformance to standards
•   market presence
•   the ability to provide financing
•   disruptive technology shifts and new business models we also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer technology. the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability. as such, we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies. any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers, suppliers, and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success.
inventory management relating to our sales to our two-tier distribution channel is complex, and excess inventory may harm our gross margins we must manage inventory relating to sales to our distributors effectively, because inventory held by them could affect our results of operations. our distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages, cancel orders if their inventory is too high, or delay orders in anticipation of new products. they also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them, and in response to seasonal fluctuations in end-user demand. our distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory, receive credits for changes in selling price, and participate in various cooperative marketing programs. inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. when facing component supply-related challenges, we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations. if we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory, we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory, which in turn could result in lower gross margins.
supply chain issues, including financial problems of contract manufacturers or component suppliers, or a shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity that increased our costs or caused a delay in our ability to fulfill orders, could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results, and our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete component supply, which could adversely affect our gross margins the fact that we do not own or operate the bulk of our manufacturing facilities and that we are reliant on our extended supply chain could have an adverse impact on the supply of our products and on our business and operating results:
•   any financial problems of either contract manufacturers or component suppliers could either limit supply or increase costs
•   reservation of manufacturing capacity at our contract manufacturers by other companies, inside or outside of our industry, could either limit supply or increase costs
•   industry consolidation occurring within one or more component supplier markets, such as the semiconductor market, could either limit supply or increase costs a reduction or interruption in supply, including disruptions on our global supply chain as a result of the covid-19 pandemic; a significant increase in the price of one or more components; a failure to adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturers; a failure to appropriately cancel, reschedule, or adjust our requirements based on our business needs; or a decrease in demand for our products could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships. furthermore, as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers, we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market. in the event that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually used, our gross margins could decrease. we have experienced longer than normal lead times in the past. although we have generally secured additional supply or taken other mitigation actions when significant disruptions have occurred, if similar situations occur in the future, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. see the risk factor above entitled "our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict, and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results."
our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers and contract manufacturers. we have experienced component shortages in the past, including shortages caused by manufacturing process issues, that have affected our operations. we may in the future experience a shortage of certain component parts as a result of our own manufacturing issues, manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers, capacity problems experienced by our suppliers or contract manufacturers including capacity or cost problems resulting from industry consolidation, or strong demand in the industry for those parts. growth in the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and component demands within specific product categories and to establish optimal component levels and manufacturing capacity, especially for labor-intensive components, components for which we purchase a substantial portion of the supply, or the re-ramping of manufacturing capacity for highly complex products. during periods of shortages or delays the price of components may increase, or the components may not be available at all, and we may also encounter shortages if we do not accurately anticipate our needs. we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations needed. accordingly, our revenue and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed. our operating results would also be adversely affected if, anticipating greater demand than actually develops, we commit to the purchase of more components than we need, which is more likely to occur in a period of demand uncertainties such as we are currently experiencing. there can be no assurance that we will not encounter these problems in the future. although in many cases we use standard parts and components for our products, certain components are presently available only from a single source or limited sources, and a global economic downturn and related market uncertainty could negatively impact the availability of components from one or more of these sources, especially during times such as we have recently seen when there are supplier constraints based on labor and other actions taken during economic downturns. we may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to deliver products to customers and seriously impact present and future sales.
we believe that we may be faced with the following challenges in the future:
•   new markets in which we participate may grow quickly, which may make it difficult to quickly obtain significant component capacity
•   as we acquire companies and new technologies, we may be dependent, at least initially, on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners
•   we face competition for certain components that are supply-constrained, from existing competitors, and companies in other markets manufacturing capacity and component supply constraints could continue to be significant issues for us. we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. during the normal course of business, in order to improve manufacturing lead-time performance and to help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements. in certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. when facing component supply-related challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations, which in turn contributes to an increase in purchase commitments. increases in our purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our products is less than our expectations. if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly, an oversupply of parts could result in excess or obsolete components that could adversely affect our gross margins. for additional information regarding our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
we depend upon the development of new products and services, and enhancements to existing products and services, and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers' changing needs, our operating results and market share may suffer the markets for our products and services are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, new product and service introductions, and evolving methods of building and operating networks. our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products and services into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production costs of existing products. if customers do not purchase and/or renew our offerings our business could be harmed. the covid-19 pandemic may also result in long-term changes in customer needs for our products and services in various sectors, along with it-related capital spending reductions, or shifts in spending focus, that could materially adversely affect us if we are unable to adjust our product and service offerings to match customer needs.
the process of developing new technology, including intent-based networking, more programmable, flexible and virtual networks, and technology related to other market transitions- such as security, digital transformation and iot, and cloud- is complex and uncertain, and if we fail to accurately predict customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed. we must commit significant resources, including the investments we have been making in our strategic priorities to developing new products and services before knowing whether our investments will result in products and services the market will accept. in particular, if our model of the evolution of networking does not emerge as we believe it will, or if the industry does not evolve as we believe it will, or if our strategy for addressing this evolution is not successful, many of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of no or limited value. for example, if we do not introduce products related to network programmability, such as software-defined-networking products, in a timely fashion, or if product offerings in this market that ultimately succeed are based on technology, or an approach to technology, that differs from ours, such as, for example, networking products based on "white box" hardware, our business could be harmed. similarly, our business could be harmed if we fail to develop, or fail to develop in a timely fashion, offerings to address other transitions, or if the offerings addressing these other transitions that ultimately succeed are based on technology, or an approach to technology, different from ours. in addition, our business could be adversely affected in periods surrounding our new product introductions if customers delay purchasing decisions to qualify or otherwise evaluate the new product offerings.
we have also been transforming our business to move from selling individual products and services to selling products and services integrated into architectures and solutions, and we are seeking to meet the evolving needs of customers which include offering our products and solutions in the manner in which customers wish to consume them. as a part of this transformation, we continue to make changes to how we are organized and how we build and deliver our technology, including changes in our business models with customers. if our strategy for addressing our customer needs, or the architectures and solutions we develop do not meet those needs, or the changes we are making in how we are organized and how we build and deliver or technology is incorrect or ineffective, our business could be harmed.
furthermore, we may not execute successfully on our vision or strategy because of challenges with regard to product planning and timing, technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion, or a lack of appropriate resources. this could result in competitors, some of which may also be our strategic alliance partners, providing those solutions before we do and loss of market share, revenue, and earnings. in addition, the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market. the success of new products and services depends on several factors, including proper new product and service definition, component costs, timely completion and introduction of these products and services, differentiation of new products and services from those of our competitors, and market acceptance of these products and services. there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product and services opportunities, develop and bring new products and services to market in a timely manner, or achieve market acceptance of our products and services or that products, services and technologies developed by others will not render our products, services or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. the products and technologies in our other product categories and key priority and growth areas may not prove to have the market success we anticipate, and we may not successfully identify and invest in other emerging or new products and services.
changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances of certain of our products or businesses, asset impairments and workforce reductions or restructurings in response to changes in industry and market conditions, we may be required to strategically realign our resources and to consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses. any resource realignment, or decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses, may result in the recording of special charges, such as inventory and technology-related write-offs, workforce reduction or restructuring costs, charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities, or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products. our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets, including purchased intangible assets, could change as a result of such assessments and decisions. although in certain instances our supply agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed, our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel with contract manufacturers and suppliers. further, our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions. additionally, we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances, and future goodwill impairment tests may result in a charge to earnings.
we initiated a restructuring plan in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, which includes a voluntary early retirement program. the implementation of this restructuring plan may be disruptive to our business, and following completion of the restructuring plan our business may not be more efficient or effective than prior to implementation of the plan. our restructuring activities, including any related charges and the impact of the related headcount restructurings, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
over the long term we intend to invest in engineering, sales, service and marketing activities, and these investments may achieve delayed, or lower than expected, benefits which could harm our operating results while we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses, over the long term, we also intend to invest in personnel and other resources related to our engineering, sales, service and marketing functions as we realign and dedicate resources on key priority and growth areas, such as security and applications, and we also intend to focus on maintaining leadership in infrastructure platforms and in services. we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits, and the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect. if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments, or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, our operating results may be adversely affected.
our business substantially depends upon the continued growth of the internet and internet-based systems a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on growth and evolution of the internet, including the continued development of the internet and the anticipated market transitions, and on the deployment of our products by customers who depend on such continued growth and evolution. to the extent that an economic slowdown or uncertainty and related reduction in capital spending adversely affect spending on internet infrastructure, including spending or investment related to anticipated market transitions, we could experience material harm to our business, operating results, and financial condition.
because of the rapid introduction of new products and changing customer requirements related to matters such as cost-effectiveness and security, we believe that there could be performance problems with internet communications in the future, which could receive a high degree of publicity and visibility. because we are a large supplier of networking products, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be materially adversely affected, regardless of whether or not these problems are due to the performance of our own products. such an event could also result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock independent of direct effects on our business.
we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results our growth depends upon market growth, our ability to enhance our existing products, and our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis. we intend to continue to address the need to develop new products and enhance existing products through acquisitions of other companies, product lines, technologies, and personnel. acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:
•   difficulties in integrating the operations, systems, technologies, products, and personnel of the acquired companies, particularly companies with large and widespread operations and/or complex products
•   diversion of management's attention from normal daily operations of the business and the challenges of managing larger and more widespread operations resulting from acquisitions
•   potential difficulties in completing projects associated with in-process research and development intangibles
•   difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions
•   initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners
•   insufficient revenue to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions
•   the potential loss of key employees, customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners of the companies we acquire following and continuing after announcement of acquisition plans acquisitions may also cause us to:
•   issue common stock that would dilute our current shareholders' percentage ownership
•   use a substantial portion of our cash resources, or incur debt
•   significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition
•   assume liabilities
•   record goodwill and intangible assets that are subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges
•   incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets
•   incur tax expenses related to the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure
•   incur large write-offs and restructuring and other related expenses
•   become subject to intellectual property or other litigation mergers and acquisitions of high-technology companies are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control, and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm our business and operating results. prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes, from successful introduction of new products and technologies to a failure to do so. even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products, there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that pre-acquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products.
in addition, our effective tax rate for future periods is uncertain and could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions. risks related to new product development also apply to acquisitions. see the risk factors above, including the risk factor entitled "we depend upon the development of new products and services, and enhancements to existing products and services, and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers' changing needs, our operating results and market share may suffer" for additional information.
entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations as we focus on new market opportunities and key priority and growth areas, we will increasingly compete with large telecommunications equipment suppliers as well as startup companies. several of our competitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than we do. additionally, as customers in these markets complete infrastructure deployments, they may require greater levels of service, support, and financing than we have provided in the past, especially in emerging countries. demand for these types of service, support, or financing contracts may increase in the future. there can be no assurance that we can provide products, service, support, and financing to effectively compete for these market opportunities.
further, entry into other markets has subjected and will subject us to additional risks, particularly to those markets, including the effects of general market conditions and reduced consumer confidence. for example, as we add direct selling capabilities globally to meet changing customer demands, we will face increased legal and regulatory requirements.
industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years. we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations. for example, some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions, or announced new strategic alliances, designed to position them with the ability to provide end-to-end technology solutions for the enterprise data center. companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us. we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. this could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. furthermore, particularly in the service provider market, rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customers, with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants.
product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue, gross margins, and net income we produce highly complex products that incorporate leading-edge technology, including both hardware and software. software typically contains bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations. there can be no assurance that our pre-shipment testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects, either ones in individual products or ones that could affect numerous shipments, which might interfere with customer satisfaction, reduce sales opportunities, or affect gross margins. from time to time, we have had to replace certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs in products that we had shipped. there can be no assurance that such remediation, depending on the product involved, would not have a material impact. an inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line, temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market, damage to our reputation, inventory costs, or product reengineering expenses, any of which could have a material impact on our revenue, margins, and net income. for example, in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 we recorded a charge to product cost of sales of $125 million related to the expected remediation costs for anticipated failures in future periods of a widely-used component sourced from a third party which is included in several of our products, and in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 we recorded a pre-tax charge of $655 million related to the expected remediation costs for certain products sold in prior fiscal years containing memory components manufactured by a single supplier between 2005 and 2010.
due to the global nature of our operations, political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition we conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries around the world. as such, our growth depends in part on our increasing sales into emerging countries. we also depend on non-u.s. operations of our contract manufacturers, component suppliers and distribution partners. our business in emerging countries in the aggregate experienced a decline in orders in fiscal 2020, and in certain prior periods. we continue to assess the sustainability of any improvements in our business in these countries and there can be no assurance that our investments in these countries will be successful. our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of political, economic or other factors relating to our operations inside and outside the united states, including impacts from global central bank monetary policy; issues related to the political relationship between the united states and other countries that can affect regulatory matters, affect the willingness of customers in those countries to purchase products from companies headquartered in the united states or affect our ability to procure components if a government body were to deny us access to those components; government-related disruptions or shutdowns; and the challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition, including, among others, the following:
•   foreign currency exchange rates
•   political or social unrest
•   economic instability or weakness or natural disasters in a specific country or region, including the current economic challenges in china and global economic ramifications of chinese economic difficulties; instability as a result of brexit; environmental protection measures, trade protection measures such as tariffs, and other legal and regulatory requirements, some of which may affect our ability to import our products, to export our products from, or sell our products in various countries or affect our ability to procure components
•   political considerations that affect service provider and government spending patterns
•   health or similar issues, including pandemics or epidemics such as the covid-19 pandemic which could continue to affect customer purchasing decisions
•   difficulties in staffing and managing international operations
•   adverse tax consequences, including imposition of withholding or other taxes on our global operations we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets, which could result in material losses most of our sales are on an open credit basis, with typical payment terms of 30 days in the united states and, because of local customs or conditions, longer in some markets outside the united states. we monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements, seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the customers can pay, and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts. beyond our open credit arrangements, we have also experienced demands for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangements.
we believe customer financing is a competitive factor in obtaining business, particularly in serving customers involved in significant infrastructure projects. our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services.
our exposure to the credit risks relating to our financing activities described above may increase if our customers are adversely affected by a global economic downturn or periods of economic uncertainty. although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk, including monitoring of particular risks in certain geographic areas, there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks.
in the past, there have been significant bankruptcies among customers both on open credit and with loan or lease financing arrangements, particularly among internet businesses and service providers, causing us to incur economic or financial losses. there can be no assurance that additional losses will not be incurred. although these losses have not been material to date, future losses, if incurred, could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. a portion of our sales is derived through our distributors. these distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory, receive credits for changes in selling prices, and participate in various cooperative marketing programs. we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for such business terms. however, distributors tend to have more limited financial resources than other resellers and end-user customers and therefore represent potential sources of increased credit risk, because they may be more likely to lack the reserve resources to meet payment obligations. additionally, to the degree that turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing, those customers' ability to pay could be adversely impacted, which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates; impairment of our investments could harm our earnings we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. our portfolio includes available-for-sale debt investments and equity investments, the values of which are subject to market price volatility. if such investments suffer market price declines, as we experienced with some of our investments in the past, we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair value of our investments below their cost basis. our non-marketable equity and other investments are subject to risk of loss of investment capital. these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. we could lose our entire investment in these companies. for information regarding the market risks associated with the fair value of portfolio investments and interest rates, refer to the section titled "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk."
we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the united states, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve, and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. historically, our primary exposures have related to nondollar-denominated sales in japan, canada, and australia and certain nondollar-denominated operating expenses and service cost of sales in europe, latin america, and asia, where we sell primarily in u.s. dollars. additionally, we have exposures to emerging market currencies, which can have extreme currency volatility. an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent that we must purchase components in foreign currencies.
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and options to reduce the short-term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency receivables, investments, and payables. in addition, we periodically hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows. our attempts to hedge against these risks may result in an adverse impact on our net income.
our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce we generally rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products. although we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending, there can be no assurance that any of these patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or that our rights will, in fact, provide competitive advantages to us. furthermore, many key aspects of networking technology are governed by industrywide standards, which are usable by all market entrants. in addition, there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications or that claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. in addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states. the outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the united states. although we are not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete, if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to the totality of the features (including aspects of products protected other than by patent rights) in a market, we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense, time, and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled us to be successful.
we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others third parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions, particularly in the united states. because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field, the secrecy of some pending patents, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes or will infringe on the patent rights of others. the asserted claims and/or initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers, suppliers, or customers, alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products or components of those products. regardless of the merit of these claims, they can be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel, or require us to develop a non-infringing technology or enter into license agreements. where claims are made by customers, resistance even to unmeritorious claims could damage customer relationships. there can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions, if at all, or that our indemnification by our suppliers will be adequate to cover our costs if a claim were brought directly against us or our customers. furthermore, because of the potential for high court awards that are not necessarily predictable, it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims settled for significant amounts. if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, if we are required to indemnify a customer with respect to a claim against the customer, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. for additional information regarding our indemnification obligations, see note 14(e) to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report.
our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions, as we have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks. further, in the past, third parties have made infringement and similar claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition.
we rely on the availability of third-party licenses many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products. there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all. the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. moreover, the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products.
our operating results may be adversely affected and damage to our reputation may occur due to production and sale of counterfeit versions of our products as is the case with leading products around the world, our products are subject to efforts by third parties to produce counterfeit versions of our products. while we work diligently with law enforcement authorities in various countries to block the manufacture of counterfeit goods and to interdict their sale, and to detect counterfeit products in customer networks, and have succeeded in prosecuting counterfeiters and their distributors, resulting in fines, imprisonment and restitution to us, there can be no guarantee that such efforts will succeed. while counterfeiters often aim their sales at customers who might not have otherwise purchased our products due to lack of verifiability of origin and service, such counterfeit sales, to the extent they replace otherwise legitimate sales, could adversely affect our operating results.
our operating results and future prospects could be materially harmed by uncertainties of regulation of the internet currently, few laws or regulations apply directly to access or commerce on the internet. we could be materially adversely affected by regulation of the internet and internet commerce in any country where we operate. such regulations could include matters such as voice over the internet or using ip, encryption technology, sales or other taxes on internet product or service sales, and access charges for internet service providers. the adoption of regulation of the internet and internet commerce could decrease demand for our products and, at the same time, increase the cost of selling our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
changes in telecommunications regulation and tariffs could harm our prospects and future sales changes in telecommunications requirements, or regulatory requirements in other industries in which we operate, in the united states or other countries could affect the sales of our products. in particular, we believe that there may be future changes in u.s. telecommunications regulations that could slow the expansion of the service providers' network infrastructures and materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition, including "net neutrality" rules to the extent they impact decisions on investment in network infrastructure.
future changes in tariffs by regulatory agencies or application of tariff requirements to currently untariffed services could affect the sales of our products for certain classes of customers. additionally, in the united states, our products must comply with various requirements and regulations of the federal communications commission and other regulatory authorities. in countries outside of the united states, our products must meet various requirements of local telecommunications and other industry authorities. changes in tariffs or failure by us to obtain timely approval of products could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
failure to retain and recruit key personnel would harm our ability to meet key objectives our success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical, managerial, sales, and marketing personnel. competition for these personnel is intense, especially in the silicon valley area of northern california. stock incentive plans are designed to reward employees for their long-term contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us. volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or equity incentive awards, or changes to our overall compensation program, including our stock incentive program, resulting from the management of share dilution and share-based compensation expense or otherwise, may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees. as a result of one or more of these factors, we may increase our hiring in geographic areas outside the united states, which could subject us to additional geopolitical and exchange rate risk. the loss of services of any of our key personnel; the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future; or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly engineering and sales personnel, could make it difficult to meet key objectives, such as timely and effective product introductions. in addition, companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in improper hiring practices. we have received these claims in the past and may receive additional claims to this effect in the future.
adverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigations may harm our operating results or financial condition we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business. litigation can be expensive, lengthy, and disruptive to normal business operations. moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. for example, brazilian authorities have investigated our brazilian subsidiary and certain of its former employees, as well as a brazilian importer of our products, and its affiliates and employees, relating to alleged evasion of import taxes and alleged improper transactions involving the subsidiary and the importer. brazilian tax authorities have assessed claims against our brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with the brazilian importer for import taxes, interest, and penalties. the asserted claims by brazilian federal tax authorities which remain are for calendar years 2003 through 2007, and the asserted claims by the tax authorities from the state of sao paulo are for calendar years 2005 through 2007. the total remaining asserted claims by brazilian state and federal tax authorities aggregate to $155 million for the alleged evasion of import and other taxes, $756 million for interest, and $383 million for various penalties, all determined using an exchange rate as of july 25, 2020. we have completed a thorough review of the matters and believe the asserted claims against our brazilian subsidiary are without merit, and we are defending the claims vigorously. while we believe there is no legal basis for the alleged liability, due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the judicial process in brazil and the nature of the claims asserting joint liability with the importer, we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome against our brazilian subsidiary and are unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any. we do not expect a final judicial determination for several years. an unfavorable resolution of lawsuits or governmental investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition. for additional information regarding certain of the matters in which we are involved, see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, subsection (f) "legal proceedings."
changes in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by changes to domestic manufacturing deduction, foreign-derived intangible income, global intangible low-tax income and base erosion and anti-abuse tax laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, and the foreign tax credit rules. significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd), an international association comprised of 37 countries, including the united states, has made changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. there can be no assurance that these changes, once adopted by countries, will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes. further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries was subject to reduced tax rates. our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. in addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities. we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
our business and operations are especially subject to the risks of earthquakes, floods, and other natural catastrophic events our corporate headquarters, including certain of our research and development operations are located in the silicon valley area of northern california, a region known for seismic activity. additionally, a certain number of our facilities are located near rivers that have experienced flooding in the past. also certain of our suppliers and logistics centers are located in regions that have been or may be affected by earthquake, tsunami and flooding activity which in the past has disrupted, and in the future could disrupt, the flow of components and delivery of products. a significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, a hurricane, volcano, or a flood, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
cyber-attacks, data breaches or malware may disrupt our operations, harm our operating results and financial condition, and damage our reputation, and cyber-attacks or data breaches on our customers' networks, or in cloud-based services provided by or enabled by us, could result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business despite our implementation of security measures, the products and services we sell to customers, and our servers, data centers and the cloud-based solutions on which our data, and data of our customers, suppliers and business partners are stored, are vulnerable to cyber-attacks, data breaches, malware, and similar disruptions from unauthorized access or tampering by malicious actors or inadvertent error. any such event could compromise our products, services, and networks or those of our customers, and the information stored on our systems or those of our customers could be improperly accessed, processed, disclosed, lost or stolen, which could subject us to liability to our customers, suppliers, business partners and others, give rise to legal/regulatory action, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition and may cause damage to our reputation. efforts to limit the ability of malicious actors to disrupt the operations of the internet or undermine our own security efforts may be costly to implement and meet with resistance, and may not be successful. breaches of security in our customers' networks, or in cloud-based services provided by or enabled by us, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to a vulnerability in our products or services, could result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business.
vulnerabilities and critical security defects, prioritization decisions regarding remedying vulnerabilities or security defects, failure of third party providers to remedy vulnerabilities or security defects, or customers not deploying security releases or deciding not to upgrade products, services or solutions could result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business the products and services we sell to customers, and our cloud-based solutions, inevitably contain vulnerabilities or critical security defects which have not been remedied and cannot be disclosed without compromising security. we may also make prioritization decisions in determining which vulnerabilities or security defects to fix, and the timing of these fixes, which could result in an exploit which compromises security. customers also need to test security releases before they can be deployed which can delay implementation. in addition, we rely on third-party providers of software and cloud-based service and we cannot control the rate at which they remedy vulnerabilities. customers may also not deploy a security release, or decide not to upgrade to the latest versions of our products, services or cloud-based solutions containing the release, leaving them vulnerable. vulnerabilities and critical security defects, prioritization errors in remedying vulnerabilities or security defects, failure of third-party providers to remedy vulnerabilities or security defects, or customers not deploying security releases or deciding not to upgrade products, services or solutions could result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business.
terrorism and other events may harm our business, operating results and financial condition the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may cause further disruptions to the economies of the united states and other countries and create further uncertainties or otherwise materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. likewise, events such as loss of infrastructure and utilities services such as energy, transportation, or telecommunications could have similar negative impacts. to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances, we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development we have several strategic alliances with large and complex organizations and other companies with which we work to offer complementary products and services and in the past have established a joint venture to market services associated with our cisco unified computing system products. these arrangements are generally limited to specific projects, the goal of which is generally to facilitate product compatibility and adoption of industry standards. there can be no assurance we will realize the expected benefits from these strategic alliances or from the joint venture. if successful, these relationships may be mutually beneficial and result in industry growth. however, alliances carry an element of risk because, in most cases, we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have a strategic alliance and, at the same time, cooperate with that company in other business areas. also, if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected, we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties. joint ventures can be difficult to manage, given the potentially different interests of joint venture partners.
our stock price may be volatile historically, our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility, particularly as a result of variations between our actual financial results and the published expectations of analysts and as a result of announcements by our competitors and us. furthermore, speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position, financial condition, results of operations, business, security of our products, or significant transactions can cause changes in our stock price. in addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies, in particular, and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. these factors, as well as general economic and political conditions and the announcement of proposed and completed acquisitions or other significant transactions, or any difficulties associated with such transactions, by us or our current or potential competitors, may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future. additionally, volatility, lack of positive performance in our stock price or changes to our overall compensation program, including our stock incentive program, may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees, virtually all of whom are compensated, in part, based on the performance of our stock price.
there can be no assurance that our operating results and financial condition will not be adversely affected by our incurrence of debt as of the end of fiscal 2020, we have senior unsecured notes outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of $14.5 billion that mature at specific dates from calendar year 2021 through 2040. we have also established a commercial paper program under which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $10.0 billion, and we had no commercial paper notes outstanding under this program as of july 25, 2020. the outstanding senior unsecured notes bear fixed-rate interest payable semiannually. the fair value of the long-term debt is subject to market interest rate volatility. the instruments governing the senior unsecured notes contain certain covenants applicable to us and our wholly-owned subsidiaries that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. in addition, we will be required to have available in the united states sufficient cash to service the interest on our debt and repay all of our notes on maturity. there can be no assurance that our incurrence of this debt or any future debt will be a better means of providing liquidity to us than would our use of our existing cash resources. further, we cannot be assured that our maintenance of this indebtedness or incurrence of future indebtedness will not adversely affect our operating results or financial condition. in addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities, as well as the terms upon which we may borrow under our commercial paper program or future debt issuances.

fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019
in fiscal 2020, we delivered growth in margins and earnings per share in a very challenging environment with the covid-19 pandemic. total revenue decreased by 5% compared with fiscal 2019. our product revenue declined in infrastructure platforms and applications, partially offset by growth in security, and we continued to make progress in the transition of our business model to increased software and subscriptions. we remain focused on accelerating innovation across our portfolio, and we believe that we have made continued progress on our strategic priorities. we continue to operate in a challenging macroeconomic and highly competitive environment. we saw broad-based weakening in the global macroeconomic environment during the fiscal year which impacted our commercial and enterprise markets. we also experienced continuing weakness in the service provider market and emerging countries, and we expect ongoing uncertainty in these markets. while the overall environment remains uncertain, we continue to aggressively invest in priority areas with the objective of driving profitable growth over the long term.
within total revenue, product revenue decreased 8% and service revenue increased by 3%. total gross margin increased by 1.4 percentage points, driven primarily by productivity benefits and product mix partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing. as a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, collectively, increased by 0.8 percentage points. operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 0.2 percentage points. diluted earnings per share increased by 1%, driven by a decrease in diluted share count of 199 million shares, partially offset by a decrease in net income of 4%.
in terms of our geographic segments, revenue from the americas decreased by $1.6 billion, driven in large part by a product revenue decline in the united states. emea revenue decreased by $0.4 billion and revenue in our apjc segment decreased by $0.5 billion. the "bricm" countries experienced a product revenue decline of 25% in the aggregate, driven by decreased product revenue in the emerging countries of india, china, mexico and brazil.
from a customer market standpoint, we experienced product revenue declines across all customer segments, with the most significant declines in the commercial and service provider markets. during fiscal 2020, we saw a decline in business momentum in the commercial and enterprise markets, which we believe was significantly related to weakness in the global macroeconomic environment.
from a product category perspective, total product revenue decreased 8% year over year. the decrease was driven by declines in revenue in infrastructure platforms and applications of 10% and 4%, respectively. these declines were partially offset by a product revenue increase in security of 12%.
fourth quarter snapshot for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, as compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, total revenue decreased by 9%. within total revenue, product revenue decreased by 13% and service revenue was flat. with regard to our geographic segment performance, on a year-over-year basis, revenue in the americas, emea and apjc decreased by 12%, 6% and 7% respectively. from a product category perspective, we experienced product revenue declines in infrastructure platforms and applications, offset by growth in security. total gross margin decreased by 0.7 percentage points, driven by unfavorable pricing partially offset by favorable product mix. as a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses collectively decreased by 0.6 percentage points. operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 0.8 percentage points. diluted earnings per share increased by 22% and net income increased by 19%. the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 included a $0.9 billion tax charge related to the tax act.
covid-19 pandemic response summary during this extraordinary time, our priority has been supporting our employees, customers, partners and communities, while positioning cisco for the future. the pandemic has driven organizations across the globe to digitize their operations and support remote workforces at a faster speed and greater scale than ever before. we remain focused on providing the technology and solutions our customers need to accelerate their digital organizations. the actions we are taking include:

critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. note 2 to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. the accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies.
the inputs into certain of our judgments, assumptions and estimates considered the economic implications of the covid-19 pandemic on our critical and significant accounting estimates. the covid-19 pandemic did not have a material impact on our significant judgments, assumptions and estimates that are reflected in our results for fiscal 2020. these estimates include: goodwill and identified purchased intangible assets and income taxes, among other items. the actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates. as the covid-19 pandemic continues to develop, many of our estimates could require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. as events continue to evolve our estimates may change materially in future periods.
revenue recognition we enter into contracts with customers that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. as a result, our contracts may contain multiple performance obligations. we determine whether arrangements are distinct based on whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and whether our commitment to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract. we classify our hardware, perpetual software licenses, and saas as distinct performance obligations. term software licenses represent multiple obligations, which include software licenses and software maintenance. in transactions where we deliver hardware or software, we are typically the principal and we record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis.
we recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised goods or services in a contract with a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. transfer of control occurs once the customer has the contractual right to use the product, generally upon shipment or once title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer. transfer of control can also occur over time for software maintenance and services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term. our hardware and perpetual software licenses are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. term software licenses include multiple performance obligations where the term licenses are recognized upfront upon transfer of control, with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as services and software updates are provided. saas arrangements do not include the right for the customer to take possession of the software during the term, and therefore have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer consumes the services. on our product sales, we record consideration from shipping and handling on a gross basis within net product sales. we record our revenue net of any associated sales taxes.
revenue is allocated among these performance obligations in a manner that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to for the promised goods or services based on standalone selling prices (ssp). ssp is estimated for each distinct performance obligation and judgment may be required in their determination. the best evidence of ssp is the observable price of a product or service when we sell the goods separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. in instances where ssp is not directly observable, we determine ssp using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs.
we apply judgment in determining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. variable consideration includes potential contractual penalties and various rebate, cooperative marketing and other incentive programs that we offer to our distributors, channel partners and customers. when determining the amount of revenue to recognize, we estimate the expected usage of these programs, applying the expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. we also consider the customers' right of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable. if actual credits received by distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates, which are based on historical experience, our revenue could be adversely affected.
see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for more details.
loss contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business. we consider the likelihood of impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. we regularly evaluate information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be made or adjusted and whether new accruals are required.
third parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions, particularly in the united states. if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairments our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques. goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date, which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired, including contingent consideration. we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit. the assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets.
in response to changes in industry and market conditions, we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill. there was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018. for the annual impairment testing in fiscal 2020, the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting units was $72.8 billion for the americas, $51.6 billion for emea, and $31.3 billion for apjc.
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of each reporting unit would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit.
the fair value of acquired technology and patents, as well as acquired technology under development, is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. the discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and then adjusted to reflect risks inherent in the development lifecycle as appropriate. we consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the high-technology communications industry, and the applicable discount rates represent the rates that market participants would use for valuation of such intangible assets.
we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. we review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. if the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. they can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income.
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate, primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes, foreign operations, r&d tax credits, domestic manufacturing deductions, foreign-derived intangible income deductions, global intangible low-taxed income, tax audit settlements, nondeductible compensation, international realignments, and transfer pricing adjustments. our effective tax rate was 19.7%, 20.2%, and 99.2% in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
during fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019, we recorded a total tax charge of $11.3 billion, consisting of $9 billion of tax expense for the u.s. transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, $1.2 billion of foreign withholding tax, and $1.1 billion of tax expense for dta re-measurement as a result of the tax act.
significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.
significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.
our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by changes to domestic manufacturing deduction, foreign-derived intangible income deduction, global intangible low-tax income and base erosion and anti-abuse tax laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, and the foreign tax credit rules. significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd), an international association comprised of 37 countries, including the united states, has made changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. there can be no assurance that these changes, once adopted by countries, will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes. as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries was subject to reduced tax rates. our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. in addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service (irs) and other tax authorities. we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.

total revenue in fiscal 2020 decreased by 5% compared with fiscal 2019. product revenue decreased by 8% and service revenue increased by 3%. our total revenue reflected declines across each of our geographic segments. product revenue for the emerging countries of bricm, in the aggregate, experienced a 25% product revenue decline, with decreases in india, china, mexico and brazil.
in addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors, including a reduced it spending environment and reductions in spending by government entities, revenue by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition, including the complexity of transactions such as multiple performance obligations; the mix of financing arrangements provided to channel partners and customers; and final acceptance of the product, system, or solution, among other factors. in addition, certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases, and the revenue related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition, which in turn would impact the revenue of the relevant segment.

infrastructure platforms the infrastructure platforms product category represents our core networking offerings related to switching, routing, wireless, and the data center. infrastructure platforms revenue decreased by 10%, or $3.0 billion. this was the product area most impacted by the covid-19 pandemic environment in the second half of fiscal 2020. switching revenue declined in both campus switching and data center switching, although we had revenue growth in our intent-based networking catalyst 9000 series. we experienced a decrease in sales of routing products, with declines primarily in the service provider and enterprise markets. revenue from wireless products declined, although we saw revenue growth in our meraki and wifi6 products. revenue from data center declined driven by continued market contraction impacting primarily our servers products.
applications the applications product category includes our collaboration offerings (unified communications, cisco telepresence and conferencing) as well as iot and appdynamics analytics software offerings. revenue in our applications product category decreased by 4%, or $235 million, with a decline in unified communications and cisco telepresence partially offset by double digit growth in appdynamics and growth in iot software offerings and webex.
security revenue in our security product category increased 12%, or $333 million, driven by higher sales of identity and access, advanced threat security, unified threat management and web security products. revenue from our cloud security portfolio reflected strong double-digit growth and continued momentum with our duo and umbrella offerings.
other products the decrease in revenue from our other products category was primarily driven by a decrease in revenue from the spvss business which we divested in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.

(1) productivity includes overall manufacturing-related costs, such as component costs, warranty expense, provision for inventory, freight, logistics, shipment volume, and other items not categorized elsewhere.
product gross margin increased by 1.4 percentage points driven by productivity improvements and favorable product mix, partially offset by unfavorable impacts from product pricing. in the second half of fiscal 2020 as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, we incurred additional logistics costs, such as freight which had a negative impact on product gross margin. our product gross margin benefited slightly from the sale of our lower margin spvss business during the second quarter of fiscal 2019.
productivity improvements were driven by memory cost savings and other cost reductions including value engineering efforts (e.g. component redesign, board configuration, test processes and transformation processes) and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations. the negative pricing impact, which was higher than the year-over-year impact we experienced in fiscal 2019, was driven by typical market factors and impacted each of our geographic segments. the favorable product mix impact was driven by impacts from each of our product categories.
service gross margin our service gross margin percentage increased by 0.7 percentage point primarily due to higher sales volume.
our service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals, our strategic investments in headcount, and the resources we deploy to support the overall service business. other factors include the mix of service offerings, as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services.

(1) the unallocated corporate items include the effects of amortization and impairments of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, significant litigation settlements and other contingencies, charges related to asset impairments and restructurings, and certain other charges. we do not allocate these items to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include such information in measuring the performance of the operating segments.
amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding.
we experienced a gross margin percentage increase in our americas segment due to productivity improvements and favorable product mix, partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing.
product gross margin in our emea segment increased due to productivity improvements and, to a lesser extent, favorable product mix, partially offset by negative impacts from pricing.
the apjc segment gross margin percentage increase was due to productivity improvements and favorable product mix, partially offset by negative impacts from pricing. higher service gross margin also contributed to the increase in the gross margin in this geographic segment.
the gross margin percentage for a particular segment may fluctuate, and period-to-period changes in such percentages may or may not be indicative of a trend for that segment.

r&d expenses r&d expenses decreased due to lower headcount-related expenses, lower discretionary spending and lower contracted services spending, partially offset by higher share-based compensation expense.
we continue to invest in r&d in order to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely fashion. if we believe that we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products, we may purchase or license technology from other businesses, or we may partner with or acquire businesses as an alternative to internal r&d.
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses decreased primarily due to lower discretionary spending and contracted services spending.
g&a expenses g&a expenses increased due to the benefit from the $400 million litigation settlement with arista networks, inc. ("arista") in fiscal 2019 and higher discretionary spending, partially offset by gains recognized on the sale of property that had been held for sale, lower headcount-related expenses, lower contracted services spending, and lower share-based compensation expense.
effect of foreign currency in fiscal 2020, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased the combined r&d, sales and marketing, and g&a expenses by approximately $141 million, or 0.8%, compared with fiscal 2019.

the increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets was due largely to the amortization of purchased intangibles from our recent acquisitions.

restructuring and other charges in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we initiated a restructuring plan, which includes a voluntary early retirement program, in order to realign the organization and enable further investment in key priority areas. the total pretax charges are estimated to be approximately $900 million. we expect the plan to be substantially completed in fiscal 2021 and estimate it will generate cost savings of approximately $1.0 billion on an annualized basis over the next few quarters.
the following table presents restructuring and other charges (in millions):
years ended                                                      july 25, 2020        july 27, 2019        july 28, 2018
restructuring and other charges included in operating expenses   $481                 $322                 $358
we initiated a restructuring plan during fiscal 2020 in order to realign the organization and enable further investment in key priority areas, with estimated pretax charges of approximately $300 million. in connection with this restructuring plan, we incurred charges of $255 million during fiscal 2020. we expect this restructuring plan to be substantially completed in fiscal 2021.
we incurred total restructuring and other charges of $481 million in fiscal 2020. we incurred charges of $255 million related to the restructuring plan initiated during fiscal 2020 and the remainder of which was related to the restructuring plan announced during fiscal 2018.
these charges were primarily cash-based and consisted of employee severance and other one-time termination benefits, and other costs. we expect to reinvest substantially all of the cost savings from these restructuring actions in our key priority areas. as a result, the overall cost savings from these restructuring actions are not expected to be material for future periods.
operating income the following table presents our operating income and our operating income as a percentage of revenue (in millions, except percentages):

operating income decreased by 4%, and as a percentage of revenue operating income increased by 0.2 percentage points. these changes resulted primarily from: a revenue decrease, the impact of the benefit from the $400 million litigation settlement with arista in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and higher restructuring and other charges, partially offset by a gross margin percentage increase (driven by productivity improvements and product mix, partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing).
interest and other income (loss), net interest income (expense), net the following table summarizes interest income and interest expense (in millions):

interest income decreased driven by a lower average balance of cash and available-for-sale debt investments and lower interest rates. the decrease in interest expense was driven by a lower average debt balance and the impact of lower effective interest rates.

the total change in net gains (losses) on available-for-sale debt investments was primarily attributable to higher realized gains as a result of market conditions, and the timing of sales of these investments. the change in net gains (losses) on non-marketable equity and other investments was primarily due to higher realized gains and higher unrealized gains, partially offset by higher impairment charges. the change in other gains (losses), net was primarily driven by higher donation expense as related to covid-19 programs, partially offset by net favorable foreign exchange impacts.
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 19.7% for fiscal 2020, compared with 20.2% for fiscal 2019. the net 0.5 percentage point decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in net discrete tax charges.
for a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the u.s. federal statutory rate of 21% and for further explanation of our provision for income taxes, see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.

liquidity and capital resources the following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet, our capital allocation strategy including stock repurchase program and dividends, our contractual obligations, and certain other commitments and activities on our liquidity and capital resources.
balance sheet and cash flows cash and cash equivalents and investments the following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and investments (in millions):
july 25, 2020           july 27, 2019        increase (decrease)
cash and cash equivalents                 $11,809                 $11,750                      $59
available-for-sale debt investments        17,610                  21,660                   (4,050        )
marketable equity securities                    -          3                                    (3        )
total                                     $29,419                 $33,413                  $(3,994        )
the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents and investments from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by a net decrease in debt of $10.2 billion, cash returned to shareholders in the form of repurchases of common stock of $2.7 billion under the stock repurchase program and cash dividends of $6.0 billion, capital expenditures of $0.8 billion and net cash paid for acquisitions and divestitures of $0.3 billion. these uses of cash were partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of $15.4 billion.
in addition to cash requirements in the normal course of business, on july 9, 2019 we announced our intent to acquire acacia communications, inc. for a net purchase consideration of approximately $2.6 billion in cash. additionally, approximately $0.7 billion of the u.s. transition tax on accumulated earnings for foreign subsidiaries and $3.0 billion of long-term debt outstanding at july 25, 2020 will mature within the next 12 months from the balance sheet date. see further discussion of liquidity and future payments under "contractual obligations" and "liquidity and capital resource requirements" below.
we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. we classify our investments as short-term investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations. we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong, with our cash equivalents and our available-for-sale debt investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. we believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position is critical at this time of uncertainty due to the covid-19 pandemic and allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies, for acquisitions, for customer financing activities, for working capital needs, and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed below.
securities lending we periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our available-for-sale debt investments. these transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities, and the securities are typically loaned only on an overnight basis. we require collateral equal to at least 102% of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid, high-quality assets. we engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties, and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses. we did not experience any losses in connection with the secured lending of securities during the periods presented.
free cash flow and capital allocation as part of our capital allocation strategy, we intend to return a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually to our shareholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock.
we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment. the following table reconciles our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow (in millions):
years ended                                      july 25, 2020        july 27, 2019        july 28, 2018
net cash provided by operating activities       $15,426              $15,831              $13,666
acquisition of property and equipment              (770      )          (909      )          (834      )
free cash flow                                  $14,656              $14,922              $12,832
we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter (which we refer to as shipment linearity), the timing and collection of accounts receivable and financing receivables, inventory and supply chain management, deferred revenue and the timing and amount of tax and other payments. for additional discussion, see "part i, item 1a. risk factors" in this report.
47
we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because of our intent to return a stated percentage of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. we further regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to, among other things, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase common stock, and pay dividends on our common stock, after deducting capital investments. a limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that the free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. in addition, we have other required uses of cash, including repaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness. free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an alternative for net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles, and other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do.
the following table summarizes the dividends paid and stock repurchases (in millions, except per-share amounts):

any future dividends are subject to the approval of our board of directors.
the remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program is approximately $10.8 billion, with no termination date.

our accounts receivable net, as of july 25, 2020 was flat compared with the end of fiscal 2019.
inventory supply chain the following table summarizes our inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers (in millions):
july 25, 2020        july 27, 2019   increase (decrease)

purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers        $4,406               $4,967          $(561             )
inventory as of july 25, 2020 decreased by 7% from our inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2019, and for the same period purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers decreased by approximately 11%. on a combined basis, inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers decreased by 10% compared with the end of fiscal 2019. the decrease in inventory was primarily due to a decrease in finished goods and lower deferred cost of sales, partially offset by an increase in raw materials.
we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. during the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity.
our purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity. certain of our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers relate to arrangements to secure long-term pricing for certain product components for multi-year periods. a significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. in certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. we believe our inventory and purchase commitments levels are in line with our current demand forecasts.

inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. we believe the amount of our inventory and purchase commitments is appropriate for our revenue levels.
financing receivables and guarantees the following table summarizes our financing receivables (in millions):
july 25, 2020        july 27, 2019            increase (decrease)
lease receivables, net                 $2,088               $2,326                        $(238        )
loan receivables, net                   5,856                5,367                          489
financed service contracts, net         2,821                2,360                          461
total, net                            $10,765              $10,053                         $712
financing receivables our financing arrangements include leases, loans, and financed service contracts. lease receivables include sales-type leases. arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. our loan receivables include customer financing for purchases of our hardware, software and services and also may include additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. we also provide financing to certain qualified customers for long-term service contracts, which primarily relate to technical support services. the majority of the revenue from these financed service contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the period during which the services are performed. financing receivables increased by 7%.
financing guarantees in the normal course of business, third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs. the financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years. in some cases, we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements. the financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing provided by third parties, with payment terms generally ranging from 60 to 90 days. during fiscal 2020, we expanded the payment terms on certain of our channel partner financing programs by 30 days in response to the covid-19 pandemic environment. in certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. the receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms.
the volume of channel partner financing was $26.9 billion, $29.6 billion, and $28.2 billion in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. these financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. the balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion as of july 25, 2020 and july 27, 2019, respectively. we could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. historically, our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial. where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and end-user financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies, or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees. in either case, the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed. as of july 25, 2020, the total maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees was approximately $207 million, of which approximately $28 million was recorded as deferred revenue.
covid-19 business resiliency program at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we initiated a new business resiliency program designed to help customers and channel partners mitigate financial challenges resulting from the covid-19 pandemic. this program includes $2.5 billion in currently available funds to provide organizations with access to financing solutions. the new business resiliency program offered by us includes an up-front 90-day payment holiday and allows a customer to defer 95 percent of the payments for a new product or solution until calendar 2021, which in turn protects their business and increases their existing cash flow.

interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes, each of which is redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of july 25, 2020.
commercial paper we have a short-term debt financing program in which up to $10.0 billion is available through the issuance of commercial paper notes. we use the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes. we had no commercial paper notes outstanding as of july 25, 2020. we had $4.2 billion in commercial paper notes outstanding as of july 27, 2019.
credit facility on may 15, 2020, we entered into a 364-day credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a $2.75 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on may 14, 2021. the credit agreement is structured as an amendment and restatement of our five-year credit facility which would have terminated on may 15, 2020, the end of its five-year term. as of july 25, 2020, we were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants, and we had not borrowed any funds under the credit facility. any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, based on certain conditions, either (i) the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) bank of america's "prime rate" as announced from time to time, or (c) libor, or a comparable or successor rate that is approved by the administrative agent ("eurocurrency rate"), for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%, or (ii) the eurocurrency rate, plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by standard & poor's financial services, llc and moody's investors service, inc., provided that in no event will the eurocurrency rate be less than 0.25%. we may also, upon the agreement of either the then-existing lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement, increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional $2.0 billion. this credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants, including that we maintain an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement.

total deferred revenue increased 11% in fiscal 2020. the increase in deferred product revenue of 17% was primarily due to increased deferrals related to our recurring software offerings. the increase in deferred service revenue was driven by the impact of contract renewals, partially offset by amortization of deferred service revenue.

contractual obligations the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously. in addition, we plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process. the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at july 25, 2020 (in millions):
payments due by period july 25, 2020                                                                        total            less than 1 year             1 to 3 years             3 to 5 years           more than 5 years operating leases                                                                $1,033                    $354                      $439                     $188                        $52

other long-term liabilities (uncertainty in the timing of future payments)       2,007
total                                                                          $32,215
operating leases for more information on our operating leases, see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. our purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity. certain of our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers relate to arrangements to secure long-term pricing for certain product components for multi-year periods. a significant portion of our reported estimated purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. we record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. see further discussion in "inventory supply chain."
other purchase obligations other purchase obligations represent an estimate of all contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, other than operating leases and commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services. purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations.
long-term debt the amount of long-term debt in the preceding table represents the principal amount of the respective debt instruments. see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
transition tax payable transition tax payable represents future cash tax payments associated with the one-time u.s. transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as a result of the tax act. see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.
other long-term liabilities other long-term liabilities primarily include noncurrent income taxes payable, accrued liabilities for deferred compensation, deferred tax liabilities, and certain other long-term liabilities. due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments, our noncurrent income taxes payable of approximately $1.9 billion and deferred tax liabilities of $81 million were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table. noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions. see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.
other commitments in connection with our acquisitions, we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of certain agreed-upon technology, development, product, or other milestones or the continued employment with us of certain employees of the acquired entities. see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
we also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our non-marketable equity and other investments, some of which may be based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones, and some of which are required to be funded on demand. the funding commitments were $0.3 billion as of each of july 25, 2020 and july 27, 2019.
off-balance sheet arrangements we consider our investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities to be off-balance sheet arrangements. in the ordinary course of business, we have non-marketable equity and other investments and provide financing to certain customers. certain of these investments are considered to be variable interest entities. we evaluate on an ongoing basis our non-marketable equity and other investments and customer financings, and we have determined that as of july 25, 2020 there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities.
on an ongoing basis, we reassess our non-marketable equity and other investments and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance. as a result of this ongoing assessment, we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities. because we may not control these entities, we may not have the ability to influence these events.
we provide financing guarantees, which are generally for various third-party financing arrangements extended to our channel partners and end-user customers. we could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. see the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under "financing receivables and guarantees."
liquidity and capital resource requirements while the covid-19 pandemic has not materially impacted our liquidity and capital resources to date, it has led to increased disruption and volatility in capital markets and credit markets. the pandemic and resulting economic uncertainty could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future. based on past performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy, through at least the next 12 months, our liquidity requirements, both in total and domestically, including the following: working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, pending acquisitions, future customer financings, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. there are no other transactions, arrangements, or relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of, as well as our requirements for, capital resources.

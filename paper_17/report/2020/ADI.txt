item 1a. risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission (sec) are descriptions of certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements in this report.
risks related to the proposed acquisition of maxim integrated products, inc.
our ability to complete the acquisition of maxim integrated products, inc. (maxim) is subject to various closing conditions, including the receipt of consents and approvals from governmental authorities, which may impose conditions that could adversely affect us or cause the acquisition not to be completed.
on july 12, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement (the merger agreement) to acquire maxim, an independent manufacturer of innovative analog and mixed-signal products and technologies. the merger is subject to a number of conditions to closing as specified in the merger agreement. these closing conditions include, among others, the receipt of required approvals under certain foreign competition laws, and the absence of governmental restraints or prohibitions preventing the consummation of the merger. no assurance can be given that the required governmental and regulatory consents and approvals will be obtained or that the required conditions to closing will be satisfied, and, if all required consents and approvals are obtained and the required conditions are satisfied, no assurance can be given as to the terms, conditions and timing of such consents and approvals. any delay in completing the merger could cause the combined company not to realize, or to be delayed in realizing, some or all of the benefits that we and maxim expect to achieve if the merger is successfully completed within its expected time frame.
additionally, either we or maxim may terminate the merger agreement under certain circumstances, including, among other reasons, if the merger is not completed by july 12, 2021 (which date may be extended under certain circumstances). under certain circumstances, including if the proposed merger is terminated due to a failure to obtain the required regulatory clearances, we may be required to pay maxim a termination fee of $830.0 million.
we can provide no assurance that the various closing conditions will be satisfied and that the necessary approvals will be obtained, or that any required conditions will not materially adversely affect the combined company following the acquisition. in addition, we can provide no assurance that these conditions will not result in the abandonment or delay of the acquisition. the occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the trading price of our common stock.
the termination of the merger agreement could negatively impact our business.
if the merger is not completed for any reason, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the expected benefits of having completed the merger, we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:
•we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on our stock price;
•we may experience negative reactions from our customers, suppliers, distributors and employees;
•we will be required to pay our costs relating to the merger, such as financial advisory, legal, financing and accounting costs and associated fees and expenses, whether or not the merger is completed;
•the merger agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to completion of the merger and such restrictions, the waiver of which is subject to maxim's consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), may prevent us from taking certain actions during the pendency of the merger; and
•matters relating to the merger (including integration planning) require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, which could otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations or to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to our business.
in addition, we could be subject to time-consuming and costly litigation related to the merger. for example, as previously disclosed, in august and september 2020, three lawsuits were filed against the company in connection with our proposed acquisition of maxim. two of the lawsuits were brought by purported shareholders against the company and the members of our board of directors and the third lawsuit was brought by a purported shareholder of maxim against maxim, the members of maxim's board of directors, the company and a subsidiary of the company. in exchange for certain disclosures that we and maxim voluntarily made in current reports on form 8-k filed on september 30, 2020, plaintiffs in each of the lawsuits voluntarily dismissed their actions in their entirety, with prejudice as to the named plaintiffs only and without prejudice to any other members of any putative class.
from and after the date of the merger agreement and prior to completion of the merger, the merger agreement restricts us from taking specified actions without maxim's consent and requires that our business be conducted in the ordinary course in all material respects. these restrictions may prevent us from making appropriate changes to our business or organizational structure or from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the merger, and could have the effect of delaying or preventing other strategic transactions. adverse effects arising from these restrictions during the pendency of the merger could be exacerbated by any delays in consummation of the merger or termination of the merger agreement.
whether or not the merger is completed, the announcement and pendency of the merger could cause disruptions in our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.
whether or not the merger is completed, the announcement and pendency of the merger could cause disruptions in our business. specifically:
•our and maxim's current and prospective employees will experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company, which might adversely affect the two companies' abilities to retain key managers and other employees;
•uncertainty regarding the completion of the merger may cause our and maxim's customers, suppliers, distributors, vendors, strategic partners or others that deal with us or maxim to delay or defer entering into contracts with us or maxim, make other decisions concerning us or maxim, or seek to change or cancel existing business relationships with us or maxim, which could negatively affect our respective businesses;
•the merger agreement restricts us and our subsidiaries from taking specified actions during the pendency of the merger without maxim's consent, which may prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities or strategic transactions that may arise prior to the completion of the merger; and
•the attention of our and maxim's management may be directed toward the completion of the merger.
we have diverted significant management resources in an effort to complete the merger and are subject to restrictions contained in the merger agreement on the conduct of our business. if the merger is not completed, we will have incurred significant costs, including the diversion of management resources, for which we will have received little or no benefit.
we will incur significant acquisition-related costs in connection with the maxim acquisition, and the combined company could incur substantial expenses related to the integration of maxim.
we have incurred and expect to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with combining the operations of the two companies, as well as transaction fees and other costs related to the merger. these costs and expenses include fees paid to financial, legal and accounting advisors, facilities and systems consolidation costs, severance and other potential employment-related costs, including severance payments that may be made to certain maxim employees, filing fees, printing expenses and other related charges. we will need to pay some of these costs regardless of whether the merger is completed.
the combined company will also incur restructuring and integration costs in connection with the merger. the costs related to restructuring will be expensed as a cost of the ongoing results of operations of either us or the combined company. there are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated in connection with the merger and the integration of maxim's business. although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, strategic benefits, and additional income, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, may offset incremental transaction, merger-related and restructuring costs over time, any net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all. we will bear many of these costs even if the merger is not completed. while we have assumed that certain expenses would be incurred in connection with the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, there are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration and implementation expenses.
combining our business with maxim's may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected and the combined company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger, which may adversely affect the combined company's business results and negatively affect the value of the combined company's common stock.
the success of the merger will depend on, among other things, the ability of the two companies to combine their businesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and realizes expected cost savings. the combined company may encounter difficulties in integrating our and maxim's businesses and realizing the anticipated benefits of the merger. the combined company must achieve the anticipated growth and cost savings without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth. if the combined company is not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.
the merger involves the combination of two companies which currently operate, and until the completion of the merger will continue to operate, as independent public companies. there can be no assurances that our respective businesses can be integrated successfully. it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees from both companies, the loss of customers, the disruption of our, maxim's or both companies' ongoing businesses, inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs and an overall post-completion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated. the combined company will be required to devote management attention and resources to integrating its business practices and operations, and prior to the merger, management attention and resources will be required to plan for such integration. potential difficulties the combined company may encounter in the integration process include the following:
•lost sales and customers as a result of certain of our and/or maxim's customers deciding not to do business with the combined company, or deciding to decrease their amount of business in order to reduce their reliance on a single company;
•integrating personnel from the two companies while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high-quality products and services, especially in the covid-19 environment which has required employees to work remotely in some locations;
•potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the merger; and
•our and/or maxim's performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management's attention caused by completing the merger and integrating the companies' operations.
any of these factors could result in the combined company failing to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, on the expected timeline or at all. an inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect upon the revenues, level of expenses and operating results of the combined company, which may adversely affect the value of the common stock of the combined company.
in addition, the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized. actual growth and cost savings, if achieved, may be lower than what we and maxim expect and may take longer to achieve than anticipated. if we and maxim are not able to adequately address integration challenges, we may be unable to successfully integrate their operations or realize the anticipated benefits of the integration of the two companies.
the market value of our common stock could decline if large amounts of our common stock are sold following the maxim acquisition.
if the merger is consummated, it is expected that we will issue a significant number of shares of our common stock to former maxim stockholders. former maxim stockholders may decide not to hold the shares of our common stock that they will receive in the merger, and our shareholders may decide to reduce their investment in us as a result of the changes to our investment profile as a result of the merger. other maxim stockholders, such as funds with limitations on their permitted holdings of stock in individual issuers, may be required to sell the shares of our common stock that they receive in the merger. such sales of our common stock could have the effect of depressing the market price for our common stock.
risks related to our global operations the extent to which the novel strain of the coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic will adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations is uncertain.
the covid-19 pandemic has resulted in government authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and shutdowns. these measures have adversely impacted and are expected to further adversely impact our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers, and those of our respective vendors and suppliers. we have significant operations worldwide, including in the united states, the philippines, ireland, singapore, malaysia, china, and india, and each of these countries has been affected by the pandemic and taken measures to try to contain it, resulting in disruptions at some of our manufacturing operations and facilities. there is considerable uncertainty regarding the impact, and expected duration, of such measures and potential future measures, and restrictions on our access to our facilities or on our support operations or workforce, or similar limitations for our vendors and suppliers. increased restrictions on or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability of air transport, port closures, and increased border controls or closures, would limit our capacity to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
the spread of covid-19 has caused us to modify our business practices, including restricting employee travel, modifying employee work locations, and canceling physical participation in meetings, events and conferences, and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, and suppliers. for example, many of our employees are temporarily working remotely, which may impact our business operations or customer relationships. such actions may result in further disruptions to our supply chain, manufacturing operations and facilities, and workforce. we cannot provide assurance that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by covid-19, and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed.
the covid-19 pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty and has caused an economic slowdown that is likely to continue and result in a global recession. the covid-19 pandemic has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which may adversely affect our and our customers' and suppliers' liquidity, cost of capital and ability to access the capital markets. as a result, the continued spread of covid-19 could cause further disruption in our supply chain and customer demand, and could adversely affect the ability of our customers to perform, including in making timely payments to us, which could further adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we cannot at this time fully quantify or forecast the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our business. the degree to which the pandemic impacts our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, or how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.
political and economic uncertainty as well as disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
continuing political and global macroeconomic uncertainty, including related to the covid-19 pandemic, trade and political disputes between the united states and china, and the united kingdom's withdrawal from the european union, and uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets may lead consumers and businesses to postpone or reduce spending, which may cause our customers to cancel, decrease or delay their existing and future orders for our products and make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. financial difficulties experienced by our customers could result in nonpayment or payment delays for previously purchased products, thereby increasing our credit risk exposure. uncertainty regarding the macroeconomic conditions as well as the future stability of the global credit and financial markets could cause the value of the currency in the affected markets to deteriorate, thus reducing the purchasing power of those customers. significant disruption to global credit and financial markets may also adversely affect our ability to access external financing sources on acceptable terms. in addition, financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers, distributors or customers could result in product delays, increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges. if economic conditions deteriorate, we may record additional charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
we are exposed to business, economic, political, legal, regulatory and other risks through our significant worldwide operations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we have significant operations and manufacturing facilities outside the united states, including in ireland, the philippines, singapore and malaysia. a significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers in international markets, and we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the future. risks associated with our international business operations include the following:
•political, legal and economic changes, crises or instability and civil unrest in markets in which we do business, including potential macroeconomic weakness related to trade and political disputes between the united states and china, the united kingdom's withdrawal from the european union and the implementation of the united states-mexico-canada agreement;
•compliance requirements of u.s. customs and export regulations, including the export administration regulations and the international traffic and arms regulations;
•currency conversion risks and exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, including the potential impact of the transition from libor;
•trade policy, commercial, travel, export or taxation disputes or restrictions, government sanctions, import or export tariffs, changes to export classifications or other restrictions imposed by the u.s. government or by the governments of the countries in which we do business, particularly in china;
•complex, varying and changing government regulations and legal standards and requirements, particularly with respect to tax regulations, price protection, competition practices, export control regulations and restrictions, customs and tax requirements, immigration, anti-boycott regulations, data privacy, intellectual property, anti-corruption and environmental compliance, including the foreign corrupt practices act;
•economic disruption from terrorism and threats of terrorism and the response to them by the u.s. and its allies;
•increased managerial complexities, including different employment practices and labor issues;
•changes in immigration laws, regulations and procedures and enforcement practices of various government agencies;
•greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights;
•natural disasters or public health emergencies, such as the current covid-19 pandemic;
•transportation disruptions and delays and increases in labor and transportation costs;
•changes to foreign taxes, tariffs and freight rates;
•fluctuations in raw material costs and energy costs;
•greater difficulty in accounts receivable collections and longer collection periods; and
•costs associated with our foreign defined benefit pension plans.
any of these risks, or any other risks related to international business operations, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
many of these risks are present within our business operations in china. for example, changes in u.s.-china relations, the political environment or international trade policies and relations could result in further revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of import or export duties and tariffs, restrictions on imports or exports, currency revaluations, or retaliatory actions, which have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results. for example, the u.s. government has recently expanded export restrictions that limit our ability to sell to certain chinese companies and to third parties that do business with those companies. these restrictions may negatively impact demand for our products, including by causing our current or potential customers to amass large inventories of our products, replace our products with products from another supplier that is not subject to the export restrictions, or focus on building indigenous semiconductor capacity to reduce reliance on u.s. suppliers. furthermore, if these export restrictions cause our current or potential customers to view u.s. companies as unreliable, we could suffer reputational damage or lose business to foreign competitors who are not subject to such export restrictions, and our business could be materially harmed. we are continuing to evaluate the impact of these restrictions on our business, but these actions may have direct and indirect adverse impacts on our revenues and results of operations in china and elsewhere.
in addition, our success in the chinese markets may be adversely affected by china's continuously evolving policies, laws and regulations, including those relating to antitrust, cybersecurity and data protection, the environment, indigenous innovation and the promotion of a domestic semiconductor industry, and intellectual property rights and enforcement and protection of those rights.
if we are unable to address our u.s. cash requirements, it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of foreign earnings, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
we carry outside basis differences in certain of our subsidiaries, primarily arising from acquisition accounting adjustments and undistributed earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested. we intend to reinvest these funds in our international operations, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings to fund our u.s. cash requirements. we require a substantial amount of cash in the united states for operating requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends and acquisitions. if we are unable to address our u.s. cash requirements through operations, borrowings under our current revolving credit facility, future debt or equity offerings or other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost, it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are indefinitely reinvested, and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
risks related to our business, industry and partners our future revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate.
our future revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors, including:
•the extent of the impact and the duration of the covid-19 pandemic;
•the effects of adverse economic conditions in the markets in which we sell our products;
•changes in customer demand or order patterns for our products and/or for end products that incorporate our products;
•the timing, delay, reduction or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability to manage inventory;
•our ability to accurately forecast distributor demand for our products;
•our ability to accurately estimate future distributor pricing credits and/or stock rotation rights;
•our ability to effectively manage our cost structure in both the short term and over a longer duration;
•changes in geographic, product or customer mix;
•changes in our effective tax rates or new or revised tax legislation in the united states, ireland or worldwide;
•the effects of issued, threatened or retaliatory government sanctions, trade barriers or economic restrictions; changes in law, regulations or other restrictions, including executive orders; and changes in import and export regulations, including restrictions on exports to certain companies or to third parties that do business with such companies, export classifications, or duties and tariffs, particularly with respect to china;
•the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us, our customers or our competitors and the market acceptance of such products;
•pricing decisions and competitive pricing pressures;
•fluctuations in manufacturing yields, adequate availability of wafers and other raw materials, and manufacturing, assembly and test capacity;
•the ability of our third-party suppliers, subcontractors and manufacturers to supply us with sufficient quantities of raw materials, products and/or components;
•a decline in infrastructure spending by foreign governments, including china;
•a decline in the u.s. government defense budget, changes in spending or budgetary priorities, a prolonged u.s. government shutdown or delays in contract awards;
•any significant decline in our backlog;
•our ability to recruit, hire, retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our customers;
•our ability to generate new design opportunities and win competitive bid selection processes;
•the increasing costs of providing employee benefits worldwide, including health insurance, retirement plan and pension plan contributions and retirement benefits;
•our ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities at efficient levels;
•potential significant litigation-related costs or product liability, warranty and/or indemnity claims, including those not covered by our suppliers or insurers;
•the difficulties inherent in forecasting future operating expense levels, including with respect to costs associated with labor, utilities, transportation and raw materials;
•the costs related to compliance with increasing worldwide government, environmental and social responsibility standards;
•new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting standards and practices; and
•the effects of public health emergencies, civil unrest, natural disasters, widespread travel disruptions, security risks, terrorist activities, international conflicts and other events beyond our control.
in addition, the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and downturns. our business and certain of the end markets we serve are also subject to rapid technological changes and material fluctuations in demand based on end-user preferences. there can be no assurance (i) that products stocked in our inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them, or (ii) that we will be able to design, develop and produce products in a timely fashion to accommodate changing customer demand. as a result of these and other factors, we may experience material fluctuations in future revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share on a quarterly or annual basis. our historical financial performance and results of operations should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance or results. in addition, if our revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share results or expectations do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the market price of our common stock may decline.
increases in our effective tax rate and exposure to additional tax liabilities may adversely impact our results of operations.
our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned. our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended october 31, 2020 was below our u.s. federal statutory rate of 21%. this is primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income. a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rate, including: new or revised tax laws or legislation or the interpretation of such laws or legislation by governmental authorities; increases in tax rates in various jurisdictions; variation in the mix of jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed; deferred taxes arising from basis differences in investments in foreign subsidiaries; any adverse resolution of ongoing tax audits or adverse rulings from taxing authorities worldwide, including our current transfer pricing appeal in ireland; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including executive compensation subject to the limitations of section 162(m) of the internal revenue code and amortization of assets acquired in connection with strategic transactions; decreased availability of tax deductions for stock-based compensation awards worldwide; and changes in available tax credits. in addition, we have a partial tax holiday through july 2025 in malaysia. the ability to extend such tax holiday beyond its expiration date cannot be assured. in addition, if we fail to meet certain conditions of the tax holiday, we may lose the benefit of the tax holiday and/or be subject to additional taxes and/or penalties. any significant increase in our future effective tax rate could adversely impact our net income during future periods.
compliance with tax legislation may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the company, and therefore necessitate the use of estimates in our consolidated financial statements and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. as regulations and guidance evolve with respect to tax legislation, and as more information is gathered and analyzed, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements.
we are also subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction. changes in these laws and regulations, including those that align to or are associated with the organization for economic cooperation and development's base erosion and profit shifting (beps) actions plans, could impact the jurisdictions where we are deemed to earn income, which could in turn adversely affect our tax liability and results of operations.
our customers typically do not make long-term product purchase commitments and incorrect forecasts or reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results.
we typically do not have sales contracts with our customers that include long-term product purchase commitments. in certain markets where end-user demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict, some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the product. in other instances, we manufacture product based on non-binding forecasts of customer demands, which may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis and at times may prove to be inaccurate. additionally, our u.s. government contracts and subcontracts may be funded in increments over a number of government budget periods and typically can be terminated by the government for its convenience. as a result, we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales, and we are subject to the risk of lower than expected orders or cancellations of orders, leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog. further, if orders or forecasts for products that meet a customer's unique requirements are canceled or unrealized we may be left with an inventory of unsaleable products, causing potential inventory write-offs, and hindering our ability to recover our costs. as a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products that are subject to these uncertainties, the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial. incorrect forecasts, or reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results.
our future success depends upon our ability to execute our business strategy, continue to innovate, improve our existing products, design, develop, produce and market new products, and identify and enter new markets.
our future success significantly depends on our ability to execute our business strategy, continue to innovate, improve our existing products, and design, develop, produce and market innovative new products and system-level solutions. product design, development, innovation and enhancement is often a complex, time-consuming and costly process involving significant investment in research and development, with no assurance of return on investment. there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and improved products, if developed, will achieve market acceptance. our products generally must conform to various evolving and sometimes competing industry standards, which may adversely affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us to incur significant costs. in addition, our customers generally impose very high quality and reliability standards on our products, which often change and may be difficult or costly to satisfy. any inability to satisfy customer quality and reliability standards or comply with industry standards and technical requirements may adversely affect demand for our products and our results of operations.
our growth is also dependent on our ability to identify and penetrate new markets where we have limited experience yet require significant investments, resources and technological advancements in order to compete effectively, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve success in these markets. there can be no assurance that the markets we serve and/or target based on our business strategy will grow in the future, that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets, that our products, or the end-products in which our products are used, will achieve customer acceptance in these markets, that competitors will not force price reductions or take market share from us, or that we can achieve or maintain adequate gross margins or profits in these markets.
we may not be able to compete successfully in markets within the semiconductor industry in the future.
we face intense competition in the semiconductor industry, and we expect this competition to increase in the future, including from companies located outside of the united states. for further discussion of our competitors, see part i, item 1 - business-competition of this annual report on form 10-k. competition is generally based on innovation, design, quality and reliability of products, product performance, features and functionality, product pricing, availability and capacity, technological service and support, and the availability of integrated system solutions, with the relative importance of these factors varying among products, markets and customers. many companies have sufficient financial, manufacturing, technical, sales and marketing resources to develop and market products that compete with our products. some of our competitors may have more advantageous supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers or suppliers. our competitors also include both emerging companies selling specialized products in markets we serve and companies outside of the u.s., including entities associated with well-funded efforts by foreign governments to create indigenous semiconductor industries. existing or new competitors may develop products or technologies that more effectively address the demands of our customers and markets with enhanced performance, features and functionality, lower power requirements, greater levels of integration or lower cost. in addition, as we seek to expand our business, including the design and production of products and services for developing and emerging markets, we may encounter increased competition from our current competitors and/or new competitors. increased competition in certain markets has resulted in and may continue to result in declining average selling prices, reduced gross margins and loss of market share in those markets. there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors, or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition. in addition, the semiconductor industry has experienced significant consolidation over the past several years. consolidation among our competitors could lead to a changing competitive landscape, which could negatively impact our competitive position and market share and harm our results of operations.
we rely on third parties for supply of raw materials and parts, semiconductor wafer foundry services, assembly and test services, and transportation, among other things, and we generally cannot control their availability or conditions of supply or services.
we rely, and plan to continue to rely, on third-party suppliers and service providers, including raw material and components suppliers, semiconductor wafer foundries, assembly and test contractors, and freight carriers (collectively, vendors) in manufacturing our products. this reliance involves several risks, including reduced control over availability, capacity utilization, delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, and costs. we currently source approximately half of our wafer requirements annually from third-party wafer foundries, including taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company (tsmc) and others. these foundries often provide wafer foundry services to our competitors and therefore periods of increased industry demand may result in capacity constraints. in addition, in certain instances, one of our vendors may be the sole source of highly specialized processing services or materials. if such vendor is unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver components to us on the time schedule and of the quality or quantity that we require, we may be forced to seek to engage an additional or replacement vendor, which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers. if additional or replacement vendors are not available, we may also experience delays in product development or shipment which could, in turn, result in the temporary or permanent loss of customers.
a prolonged disruption of our internal manufacturing operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
in addition to leveraging an outsourcing model for manufacturing operations, we also rely on our internal manufacturing operations located in the united states, ireland, the philippines, singapore and malaysia. a prolonged disruption at, or inability to utilize, one or more of our manufacturing facilities, loss of raw materials or damage to our manufacturing equipment for any reason, including due to the covid-19 pandemic, natural or man-made disasters, civil unrest or other events outside of our control, such as widespread outbreaks of illness, or the failure to maintain our labor force at one or more of these facilities, may disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in us being unable to timely satisfy customer demand. as a result, we could forgo revenue opportunities, potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
the markets for semiconductor products are cyclical, and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices, and conversely, we may not be able to satisfy unexpected demand for our products.
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly. the demand for our products is subject to the strength of our four major end markets of industrial, communications, automotive and consumer. if we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of increased demand for our products, and that demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expect, or declines, or if we overbuild inventory in a period of decreased demand, our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of increased operating expenses, reduced margins, underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges. these capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could also lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results. conversely, during periods of rapid increases in demand, our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the demand. in addition, we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner, procure adequate resources and raw materials, locate suitable third-party suppliers, or respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to demand for new products requested by our customers, and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected.
our semiconductor products are complex and we may be subject to warranty, indemnity and/or product liability claims, which could result in significant costs and damage to our reputation and adversely affect customer relationships, the market acceptance of our products and our operating results.
semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain defects that affect their quality or performance. failures in our products and services or in the products of our customers could result in damage to our reputation for reliability and increase our legal or financial exposure to third parties. certain of our products and services could also contain security vulnerabilities, defects, bugs and errors, which could also result in significant data losses, security breaches and theft of intellectual property. we generally warrant that our products will meet their published specifications, and that we will repair or replace defective products, for one year from the date title passes from us to the customer. we invest significant resources in the testing of our products; however, if any of our products contain defects, we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders. these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others, including liability for costs and expenses associated with product defects, including recalls, which may adversely impact our operating results. we may also be subject to customer intellectual property indemnity claims. our customers have on occasion been sued, and may be sued in the future, by third parties alleging infringement of intellectual property rights, or damages resulting from use of our products. those customers may seek indemnification from us under the terms and conditions of our sales contracts with them. in certain cases, our potential indemnification liability may be significant.
further, we sell to customers in industries such as automotive (including autonomous vehicles), aerospace, defense, and healthcare, where failure of the systems in which our products are integrated could cause damage to property or persons. we may be subject to product liability claims if our products, or the integration of our products, cause system failures. any product liability claim, whether or not determined in our favor, could result in significant expense, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, and harm our business. in addition, if any of our products contain defects, or have reliability, quality or compatibility problems not capable of being resolved, our reputation may be damaged, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to customers and which could also adversely affect our operating results. furthermore, we market and sell our products through authorized third-party distributors, and from time to time our products may be diverted from our authorized distribution channels and sold on the "gray market." there is a risk that customers purchasing our products on the gray market may use our products for purposes for which they were not intended, or may purchase counterfeit or substandard products, including products that have been altered, mishandled or damaged, or used products presented as new, which could result in damage to property or persons and cause serious reputational harm.
the fabrication of integrated circuits is highly complex and precise, and our manufacturing processes utilize a substantial amount of technology. minute impurities, contaminants in the manufacturing environment, difficulties in the fabrication process, defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process, manufacturing equipment failures, wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional. while we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing, it is possible that some processes could become unstable. this instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
if we are unable to recruit or retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be adversely affected.
our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the recruitment, retention and effective succession of our key personnel, including our leadership team, management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers. the competition for these employees is intense. the loss of key personnel or the inability to attract, hire and retain key employees with critical technical skills to achieve our strategy, including as a result of changes to immigration policies, could also have a material adverse effect on our business. we do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or other employees.
to remain competitive, we may need to invest in or acquire other companies, purchase or license technology from third parties, or enter into other strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or enhance our existing products.
an element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses, assets, products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings, diversify our product portfolio, expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce, expand our technical skill sets or enhance our technological capabilities. we may not be able to find businesses that have the technology or resources we need and, if we find such businesses, we may not be able to invest in, purchase or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable terms or at all. acquisitions, investments and technology licenses are challenging to complete for a number of reasons, including difficulties in identifying potential targets, the cost of potential transactions, competition among prospective buyers and licensees, the need for regulatory approvals, and difficulties related to integration efforts. in addition, investments in companies are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of our investment. both in the u.s. and abroad, governmental regulation of acquisitions, including antitrust and other regulatory reviews and approvals, has become more complex, increasing the costs and risks of undertaking and consummating significant acquisitions. in order to finance a potential transaction, we may need to raise additional funds by issuing securities or borrowing money. we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are superior to the rights of our common shareholders.
acquisitions also involve a number of challenges and risks, including:
•diversion of management's attention in connection with both negotiating the transaction and integrating the acquired assets and businesses;
•difficulty or delay integrating acquired technologies, operations, systems and infrastructure, and personnel with our existing businesses;
•strain on managerial and operational resources as management tries to oversee larger or more complex operations;
•the future funding requirements for acquired companies, including research and development costs, employee compensation and benefits, and operating expenses, which may be significant;
•servicing significant debt that may be incurred in connection with acquisitions;
•potential loss of key employees;
•exposure to unforeseen liabilities or regulatory compliance issues of acquired companies;
•higher than expected or unexpected costs relating to or associated with an acquisition and integration of assets and businesses;
•difficulty realizing expected cost savings, operating synergies and growth prospects of an acquisition in a timely manner or at all; and
•increased risk of costly and time-consuming legal proceedings.
if we are unable to successfully address these risks, we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of our acquisitions, which may have an adverse effect on our business strategy, plans and operating results.
we rely on supplies, services and manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas, which could affect our ability to produce products.
we, like many companies in the semiconductor industry, rely on supplies, services, internal manufacturing capacity, wafer fabrication foundries and other subcontractors in geologically unstable locations around the world. earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding or other natural disasters may disrupt local semiconductor-related businesses and adversely affect manufacturing capacity, availability and cost of key raw materials, utilities and equipment, and availability of key services, including transport of our products worldwide. our insurance may not adequately cover losses resulting from such disruptions. any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities, or those of our subcontractors or third-party wafer fabrication foundries, as a result of fire, flood, natural disaster, unavailability of utilities or otherwise, could result in a temporary or permanent loss of customers for affected products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
our operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors.
a significant portion of our sales are through independent global and regional distributors that are not under our control. these independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts for our products or they could terminate their representation of us. we generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors, including our largest distributor, and are not protected against accounts receivable default or declarations of bankruptcy by these distributors. our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our operating results. termination of a significant distributor or a group of distributors, whether at our initiative or the distributor's initiative or through consolidation in the distribution industry, could disrupt our current business, and if we are unable to find suitable replacements with the appropriate scale and resources, our operating results could be adversely affected.
we are required to estimate the effects of returns and allowances provided to distributors and record revenue at the time of sale to the distributor. if our estimates of such credits and rights are materially understated, it could cause subsequent adjustments that negatively impact our revenues and gross profits in a future period.
our stock price may be volatile.
the market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future, as it may be significantly affected by factors including:
•the extent of the impact and the duration of the covid-19 outbreak;
•global economic conditions generally;
•crises in global credit, debt and financial markets;
•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and operating results;
•changes in financial estimates or other statements made by securities analysts or others in analyst reports or other publications, or our failure to perform in line with those estimates or statements or our published guidance;
•financial results and prospects of our customers;
•u.s. and foreign government actions, including with respect to trade, travel, export and taxation;
•changes in market valuations of other semiconductor companies;
•rumors and speculation in the press, investment community or on social media about us, our customers or other companies in our industry;
•announcements by us, our customers or our competitors of significant new products, technical innovations, material transactions, acquisitions or dispositions, litigation, capital commitments, including share repurchases and dividend policies, or revised earnings estimates;
•departures of key personnel;
•alleged noncompliance with laws, regulations or ethics standards by us or any of our employees, officers or directors; and
•negative media publicity targeting us or our suppliers, customers or competitors.
the stock market has historically experienced volatility, especially within the semiconductor industry, that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies. these market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our operating results.
our directors and executive officers periodically buy or sell shares of our common stock in the market, including pursuant to rule 10b5-1 trading plans. regardless of the individual's reasons for such purchases or sales, securities analysts and investors could view such transactions as positive or negative indicators and our stock price could be adversely affected as a result.
risks related to our indebtedness if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow, we may not be able to service our debt obligations, including making payments on our outstanding indebtedness.
our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations, many of which are beyond our control. for example, the disruption to economic activity resulting from the covid-19 pandemic has had, and is likely to continue to have, adverse effects on our supply chain, manufacturing operations and facilities, and workforce. if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our outstanding debt, we may be required to, among other things:
•seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets;
•refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness;
•borrow under our revolving credit facility;
•divert funds that would otherwise be invested in growing our business operations;
•repatriate earnings as dividends from foreign locations with potential for negative tax consequences; or
•sell selected assets.
such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt, which could negatively impact our financial results. in addition, we may not be able to obtain any such financing, refinancing or complete a sale of assets on economically favorable terms. in the case of financing or refinancing, favorable interest rates will depend on the health of the debt capital markets.
restrictions in our revolving credit facility, term loan and outstanding debt instruments may limit our activities.
our current revolving credit facility, term loan and outstanding debt instruments impose, and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may impose, restrictions that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company, including to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on our assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as changes in technology, government regulations and the level of competition in our markets. in addition, our revolving credit facility and term loan require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. if we breach any of the covenants under our revolving credit facility, the indentures governing our outstanding senior unsecured notes, the term loan facility or any future debt instruments to which we may become subject and do not obtain appropriate waivers, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable and/or we may be restricted from further borrowing under our revolving credit facility.
risks related to legal, regulatory and compliance matters we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary intellectual property rights, which may limit our ability to compete effectively.
our future success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property. we primarily rely on patent, mask work, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure agreements, information security practices, and other methods, to protect our proprietary information, technologies and processes. despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain or disclose our confidential information, reverse engineer or copy our technologies, products or processes, or otherwise misappropriate our intellectual property. moreover, the laws of foreign countries in which we design, manufacture, market and sell our products may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property.
there can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. in addition, any of our existing or future patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. as such, any rights granted under these patents may not prevent others from exploiting our proprietary technology. we may not be able to obtain foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to our u.s. patents and applications. even if patents are granted, we may not be able to effectively enforce our rights. if our patents and mask works do not adequately protect our technology, or if our registrations expire prior to end of life of our products, our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours. our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents.
we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and strategic partners. we also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies, documentation and other proprietary information. despite these efforts, internal or external parties may attempt to copy, disclose, obtain or use our products or technology without our authorization. also, former employees may seek employment with our business partners, customers or competitors, and there can be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment.
a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems or certain of our products could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation.
we rely on information technology systems throughout our company to keep financial records and customer data, process orders, manage inventory, coordinate shipments to customers, maintain confidential and proprietary information, assist in semiconductor engineering and other technical activities and operate other critical functions such as internet connectivity, network communications and email. our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, employee malfeasance, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. due to the covid-19 pandemic, many of our employees and directors are temporarily working remotely, which may pose additional data security risks. we also rely upon external cloud providers for certain infrastructure activities. if we were to experience a prolonged disruption in the information technology systems that involve our internal communications or our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. we may also be subject to security breaches of our information technology systems and certain of our products caused by viruses, illegal break-ins or hacking, sabotage, or acts of vandalism by third parties or our employees or contractors. our security measures or those of our third-party service providers may not detect or prevent security breaches, defects, bugs or errors. in addition, we provide our confidential and proprietary information to our strategic partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business. those third parties may be subject to security breaches or otherwise compromise the protection of such information. security breaches of our information technology systems or those of our partners could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential and proprietary information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers, suppliers, or other third parties which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage.
we are occasionally involved in litigation, including claims regarding intellectual property rights, which could be costly to litigate and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties.
the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights. other companies or individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes, and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling infringing products, if those patents are found to be valid and infringed by us. in the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property, and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement, and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel. we could also be subject to litigation or arbitration disputes arising under our contractual obligations, as well as customer indemnity, warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend those claims or pay damage awards. there can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities, and we may elect to self-insure with respect to certain matters. an adverse outcome in litigation or arbitration could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or on our operating results or cash flows in the period in which the dispute is resolved.
we are subject to environmental, health and safety (ehs) regulations, which could increase our expenses and affect our operating results.
our industry is subject to ehs requirements, particularly those that control and restrict the sourcing, use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage and disposal of certain substances, and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process. public attention to environmental sustainability and social responsibility concerns continues to increase, and our customers routinely include stringent environmental and other standards in their contracts with us. changes in ehs laws or regulations may require us to invest in costly equipment or make manufacturing process changes and may adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. in addition, we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by potential or actual releases of such materials. any failure to control such materials adequately or to comply with existing or future ehs statutory or regulatory standards, requirements or contractual obligations could result in any of the following, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results:
•liability for damages and remediation;
•the imposition of regulatory penalties and civil and criminal fines;
•the suspension or termination of the development, manufacture, sale or use of certain of our products;
•changes to our manufacturing processes or a need to substitute materials that may cost more or be less available;
•damage to our reputation; and/or
•increased expenses associated with compliance.
if we fail to comply with government contracting regulations, we could suffer a loss of revenue or incur price adjustments or other penalties.
some of our revenue is derived from contracts with agencies of the united states government and subcontracts with its prime contractors. as a united states government contractor or subcontractor, we are subject to federal contracting regulations, including the federal acquisition regulations, which govern the allowability of costs incurred by us in the performance of united states government contracts. certain contract pricing is based on estimated direct and indirect costs, which are subject to change. additionally, the united states government is entitled after final payment on certain negotiated contracts to examine all of our cost records with respect to such contracts and to seek a downward adjustment to the price of the contract if it determines that we failed to furnish complete, accurate and current cost or pricing data in connection with the negotiation of the price of the contract.
in connection with our united states government business, we are also subject to government audits and to review and approval of our policies, procedures, and internal controls for compliance with procurement regulations and applicable laws, such as the cybersecurity maturity model certification. in certain circumstances, if we do not comply with the terms of a contract or with regulations or statutes, we could be subject to downward contract price adjustments or refund obligations or could in extreme circumstances be assessed civil and criminal penalties or be debarred or suspended from obtaining future contracts for a specified period of time. any such suspension or debarment or other sanction could have an adverse effect on our business.
under some of our government subcontracts, we are required to maintain secure facilities and to obtain security clearances for personnel involved in performance of the contract, in compliance with applicable federal standards. if we were unable to comply with these requirements, or if personnel critical to our performance of these contracts were unable to obtain or maintain their security clearances, we might be unable to perform these contracts or compete for other projects of this nature, which could adversely affect our revenue.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts)
the following discussion includes a comparison of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources for the fiscal years ended october 31, 2020 (fiscal 2020), the fiscal year ended november 2, 2019 (fiscal 2019) and the fiscal year ended november 3, 2018 (fiscal 2018). our fiscal year is the 52-week or 53-week period ending on the saturday closest to the last day in october. fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 were 52-week fiscal periods, while fiscal 2018 was a 53-week period. the additional week in fiscal 2018 was included in the first quarter ended february 3, 2018. therefore, fiscal 2018 included an additional week of operations as compared to fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019.
impact of covid-19 on our business the pandemic caused by the novel strain of the coronavirus (covid-19) has resulted in government authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders and shutdowns. these measures have impacted and likely will continue to impact our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers and those of our respective vendors and suppliers. we have significant operations worldwide, including in the united states, the philippines, ireland, singapore, malaysia, china and india. each of these countries has been affected by the pandemic and taken measures to try to contain it, resulting in disruptions at some of our manufacturing operations and facilities. since the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2020, our manufacturing operations and supply chain generally stabilized at normal levels, but that could change in the future given that the covid-19 situation remains dynamic.
the spread of covid-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including restricting employee travel, modifying employee work locations and cancelling physical participation in meetings, events and conferences) and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers and shareholders.
while we are confident that our strategy and long-term contingency planning have positioned us well to weather the current uncertainty, we cannot at this time fully quantify or forecast the impact of covid-19 on our business. the degree to which covid-19 impacts our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, and we cannot provide assurance as to the duration and spread of the pandemic, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, or how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.
proposed acquisition of maxim integrated products, inc.
on july 12, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement (the merger agreement) to acquire maxim integrated products, inc. (maxim), an independent manufacturer of innovative analog and mixed-signal products and technologies. under the terms of the merger agreement, maxim stockholders will receive, for each outstanding share of maxim common stock, 0.630 of a share of our common stock. the estimated merger consideration is approximately $23.0 billion based on the closing price of our common stock on november 20, 2020. following the recent approval of maxim stockholders and our shareholders, as well as the expiration of the waiting-period applicable to u.s. regulatory approval, the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of certain non-u.s. regulatory approvals. see note 6, acquisitions, of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information.
results of operations a discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 has been omitted from this form 10-k, but may be found in "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of our form 10-k for fiscal 2019 filed with the securities and exchange commission on november 26, 2019.

revenue trends by end market the following table summarizes revenue by end market. the categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the "sold to" customer information, the "ship to" customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated. as data systems for capturing and tracking this data and our methodology evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. when this occurs, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market.

revenue decreased across all end markets in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019. the revenue decreases in the automotive end market were more pronounced as this market was impacted by lower vehicle sales and a global slowdown in production as many of our customers were required to suspend their operations in response to shelter in place orders from governments around the world in response to the covid-19 pandemic. the revenue decreases in the consumer end market resulted from a broad-based decrease in demand for our products in this end market, including lower demand for products used in portable consumer applications. the decline in the communications end market was primarily the result of the timing of infrastructure deployment cycles and the ramp up of these cycles in certain regions during fiscal 2019. the percentage decline in our industrial end market was less than the overall percentage decline in total revenue as the broad-based weakness across many applications was offset by growth in the instrumentation test, healthcare and energy sectors of this end market.
revenue by sales channel the following tables summarize revenue by sales channel. we sell our products globally through a direct sales force, third party distributors, independent sales representatives and via our website. distributors are customers that buy products with the intention of reselling them. direct customers are non-distributor customers and consist primarily of original equipment manufacturers (oems). other customers include the u.s. government, government prime contractors and certain commercial customers for which revenue is recorded over time.

in all periods presented, the predominant countries comprising "rest of north and south america" are canada and mexico; the predominant countries comprising "europe" are germany, sweden, and the netherlands; and the predominant countries comprising "rest of asia" are taiwan, malaysia, south korea and singapore.
total revenue decreased in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019. however, revenue in china increased in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 as a result of the region's relatively quick recovery from covid-19 related shutdowns as compared to other regions, as well as increases in demand across our broad market customers and stable revenue in the communications end market attributable to the 5g ramp up.
the sales decrease in the united states year-over-year in fiscal 2020 was most pronounced in the consumer end market. the sales decrease in europe year-over-year in fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by products sold into the automotive and industrial end markets, while demand for products sold into the communications end market was relatively flat. the sales decrease in japan year-over-year in fiscal 2020 was broad-based as all end markets decreased from fiscal 2019. the sales decrease in rest of asia year-over-year in fiscal 2020 was primarily related to a decrease in our communications revenue.

gross margin percentage in fiscal 2020 decreased by 110 basis points compared to fiscal 2019, primarily as a result of lower internal utilization of our factories due to decreased customer demand and temporary shutdowns at some of our manufacturing locations in response to the covid-19 pandemic, partially offset by a write-down of inventory in fiscal 2019, which did not repeat in fiscal 2020.

r&d expenses decreased in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 primarily as a result of lower discretionary spending, partially in response to uncertainty associated with the covid-19 pandemic, as well as lower r&d employee-related salary and benefit expenses and lower variable compensation expense.
r&d expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from year-to-year depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts, which we view as critical to our future growth. we expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products. we believe that a continued commitment to r&d is essential to maintain product leadership with our existing products as well as to provide innovative new product offerings, and therefore, we expect to continue to make significant r&d investments in the future.

smg&a expenses increased in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019, primarily as a result of a $40.0 million charitable contribution to the analog devices foundation made in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and $20.1 million in acquisition-related transaction costs in connection with the proposed acquisition of maxim, partially offset by lower discretionary spending in response to uncertainty associated with the covid-19 pandemic, lower smg&a employee-related salary and benefit expense and lower variable compensation expense.
special charges we monitor global macroeconomic conditions on an ongoing basis and continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency, as well as a better alignment of expenses with revenues. as a result of these assessments, we have undertaken various restructuring actions over the past several years.
repositioning actions: as a result of organizational initiatives to better align our global workforce with our long-term strategic plan, we recorded special charges of $49.4 million in fiscal 2020. the repositioning actions taken in fiscal 2020 are not expected to result in any future net annualized savings as the reduction in salary and benefits from workforce reductions will be redeployed to other areas of the business as part of the reorganizational initiative.
closure of manufacturing facilities: as a result of our decision to consolidate certain wafer and test facility operations acquired as part of the acquisition of linear technology corporation (linear), we recorded special charges of $2.9 million in fiscal 2020. once fully implemented, we expect that these actions will result in estimated annual salary, variable compensation and employee benefit savings of approximately $60.0 million.

the decrease in operating income in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily the result of a $323.3 million decrease in gross margin and an $11.8 million increase in smg&a expenses, partially offset by a $79.8 million decrease in r&d expenses and a $43.3 million decrease in special charges as more fully described above under the headings gross margin, selling, marketing, general and administrative (smg&a), research and development (r&d) and special charges.

our effective tax rates for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 were below the u.s. statutory rate of 21% due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income. for fiscal 2020, our pretax income was primarily generated in ireland at a tax rate of 12.5%. for fiscal 2019, our pretax income was primarily generated in ireland and singapore, at tax rates ranging from 12.5% to 17% in these jurisdictions.
our tax rate for fiscal 2020 was also impacted by discrete items, primarily related to $25.9 million of income tax benefits resulting from the resolution of the internal revenue service audit of linear's pre-acquisition federal income tax returns for fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2017, as well as other income tax benefits recorded upon the filing of our fiscal 2019 federal income tax return and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation payments of $16.2 million.
the tax rate for fiscal 2019 includes a $17.2 million tax benefit from a voluntary accounting policy change in the statutory statements of a foreign subsidiary, an $11.2 million tax benefit from an increase in tax credits upon filing our fiscal 2018 federal income tax return and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation payments of $28.7 million.

the decrease in net income in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 was a result of a $212.4 million decrease in operating income, partially offset by a $38.3 million decrease in nonoperating expense and a $31.9 million decrease in provision for income taxes, as more fully described above under the headings operating income, nonoperating (income) expense and provision for income taxes.
liquidity and capital resources at october 31, 2020, our principal source of liquidity was $1,055.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $241.9 million was held in the united states and the balance of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries. we manage our worldwide cash requirements by, among other things, reviewing available funds held by our foreign subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness by which those funds can be accessed in the united states. we do not expect current regulatory restrictions or taxes on repatriation to have a material adverse effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, including money market funds. we maintain these balances with high credit quality counterparties, continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk.
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, transaction costs associated with our proposed acquisition of maxim and dividend payments (if any) in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months.

the following changes contributed to the net change in cash and cash equivalents from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020. a discussion of changes in our liquidity and capital resources from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 has been omitted from this form 10-k, but may be found in "item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" of our form 10-k for fiscal 2019 filed with the securities and exchange commission on november 26, 2019.
operating activities cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. the decrease in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily a result of lower net income, adjusted for non-cash items, and a decrease from changes in working capital.
investing activities investing cash flows generally consist of capital expenditures and cash used for acquisitions. the decrease in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily the result of a decrease in cash used for capital expenditures.
financing activities financing cash flows consist primarily of payments of dividends to stockholders, repurchases of common stock, issuance and repayment of debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to employee equity incentive plans. the decrease in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily the result of a net increase related to our debt instruments and a decrease in common stock repurchases, partially offset by an increase in dividend payments and a decrease in net proceeds from employee stock plans.

_______________________________________
(1)we use the average of the current year and prior year ending net accounts receivable and ending inventory balance in our calculation of days sales outstanding and days cost of sales in inventory, respectively.
the increase in accounts receivable for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily the result of normal variations in the timing of collections and billings.
inventory in dollars decreased in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019, primarily as a result of our efforts to balance manufacturing production, demand and inventory levels. our inventory levels are impacted by our need to support forecasted sales demand and variations between those forecasts and actual demand.
current liabilities decreased to $1,365.0 million at october 31, 2020 from $1,508.6 million recorded at the end of fiscal 2019. the decrease was primarily due to decreases in the current portion our debt, partially offset by increases in accrued liabilities.
revolving credit facility on june 28, 2019, we entered into a second amended and restated revolving credit agreement with bank of america n.a. as administrative agent and the other banks identified therein as lenders (revolving credit agreement), which further amended and restated our amended and restated revolving credit agreement dated as of september 23, 2016. the revolving credit agreement provides for a five year unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.25 billion, expiring on june 28, 2024. loans under the revolving credit agreement can be eurocurrency rate loans or base rate loans at our option. each eurocurrency rate loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the eurocurrency rate plus a margin based on our debt ratings from time to time of between 0.690% and 1.375%. each base rate loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the base rate plus a margin based on our debt ratings from time to time of between 0.00% and 0.375%. in december 2018, we borrowed $75.0 million under the previous revolving credit facility and utilized the proceeds for the repayment of existing indebtedness and working capital requirements. we repaid the $75.0 million plus interest of $0.2 million in january 2019. in march 2020, we borrowed $350.0 million under this revolving credit facility and utilized the proceeds for the repayment of existing indebtedness and working capital requirements. we repaid the $350.0 million plus interest of $0.6 million in april 2020.
as of october 31, 2020, we have no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility, but we may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for repayment of existing indebtedness, stock repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other lawful corporate purposes. the terms of the revolving credit agreement impose restrictions on our ability to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. in addition, the revolving credit agreement requires us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of total consolidated funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (ebitda) for a trailing twelve-month period of not greater than 3.5 to 1.0, assuming we do not undertake any significant acquisitions, mergers, and other fundamental changes. should such a change occur, we may be authorized to increase the covenant to 4.0 to 1.0.  as of october 31, 2020, we were compliant with these covenants. see note 13, revolving credit facility, of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information on our revolving credit facility.
debt as of october 31, 2020, we had $5.1 billion of carrying value outstanding on our debt. the difference in the carrying value of the debt and the principal is due to the unamortized discount and issuance fees on these instruments that will accrete to the face value over the term of the debt. the indentures governing certain of our debt instruments contain covenants that may limit our ability to: incur, create, assume or guarantee any debt or borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property; enter into sale and lease-back transactions with respect to a principal property; and consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to, any other party. as of october 31, 2020, we were compliant with these covenants. see note 14, debt, of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information on our outstanding debt.
stock repurchase program our common stock repurchase program has been in place since august 2004. in the aggregate, our board of directors has authorized us to repurchase $8.2 billion of our common stock under the program. under the program, we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions. unless terminated earlier by resolution of our board of directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program.
as of october 31, 2020, an additional $1.9 billion remained available for repurchase under the current authorized program. the repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock. we also repurchase shares in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock units/awards or the exercise of stock options. in march 2020, we temporarily suspended our share repurchase program as a result of the global macroeconomic environment. that suspension continued through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 given the planned acquisition of maxim. we reinstated the share repurchase program in november 2020 (which is part of the fiscal year ending october 30, 2021). future repurchases of common stock will be dependent upon our financial position, results of operations, outlook, liquidity, and other factors we deem relevant.
capital expenditures net additions to property, plant and equipment were $165.7 million in fiscal 2020 and were funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations. we expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2021 to be approximately 4% of fiscal 2021 revenue. these capital expenditures will be funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash generated from operations.
analog devices foundation during the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we contributed 335,654 shares of our common stock to the analog devices foundation. as of the date of the contribution, the shares had a fair value of approximately $40.0 million. this expense was recorded in smg&a in the consolidated statement of income.
dividends on november 23, 2020, our board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.62 per outstanding share of common stock. the dividend will be paid on december 15, 2020 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on december 4, 2020 and is expected to total approximately $229.1 million. we currently expect quarterly dividends to continue in future periods, although they remain subject to determination and declaration by our board of directors. the payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors, including our financial performance, outlook and liquidity.

(1)tax obligation relates to the one-time tax on deemed repatriated earnings under the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 enacted in fiscal 2018. see note 12, income taxes, of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further discussion.
(2)certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses. these escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table.
(3)amounts primarily represent future fixed and non-cancellable cash payments associated with software technology and licenses, including the payments due within the next twelve months.
(4)debt obligations are assumed to be held to maturity.
(5)these payments relate to obligations under our deferred compensation plan. the deferred compensation plan allows certain members of management and other highly-compensated employees and non-employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of their compensation. the amount in the "more than 5 years" column of the table represents the remaining total balance under the deferred compensation plan to be paid to participants who have not terminated employment. since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals for participants who have not yet terminated employment, we have included the future obligation to these participants in the "more than 5 years" column of the table.
(6)our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country. the payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected contributions to these plans for the current fiscal year. the actual future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are not practical because of potential future changes in variables, such as plan asset performance, interest rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels. as of october 31, 2020, our net liability related to our defined benefit plans was $79.2 million. see note 11, retirement plans, of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further discussion.
as of october 31, 2020, our total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions was $24.7 million, which are included in non-current income taxes payable in our consolidated balance sheets contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. due to the complexity associated with our tax uncertainties, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the non-current liabilities associated with these uncertain tax positions. therefore, we have not included these uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table.
the expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information available as of october 31, 2020.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of october 31, 2020, we had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
new accounting pronouncements from time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board (fasb) and are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. unless otherwise discussed, management believes that the impact of recently issued standards will not have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations. see note 2s, new accounting pronouncements, of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements, including the dates of adoption and impact on our historical financial condition and results of operations.
leases in february 2016, the fasb issued asu 2016-02, leases (topic 842) (asu 2016-02). asu 2016-02 requires a lessee to recognize most leases on the balance sheet but recognize expenses on the income statement in a manner similar to historical practice. the update states that a lessee will recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-to-use asset for the right to use the underlying assets for the lease term. leases will continue to be classified as either financing or operating, with classification affecting the recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease. the fasb has issued amendments and updates to the new standard, including practical expedients to be used during adoption.  the company adopted the standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 under the modified retrospective approach. as a result of the adoption of asu 2016-02, we changed our accounting policy for leases. see note 9, leases, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for details of the impact of this asu on our financial statements.
critical accounting policies and estimates management's discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information. we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. if actual results differ significantly from management's estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements. we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies; however, the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective.
revenue recognition recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the providing entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. as a result of the adoption of new revenue accounting rules in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we revised our revenue recognition policy. we now recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. under this rule, we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: (1) we have entered into a binding agreement, (2) the performance obligations have been identified, (3) the transaction price to the customer has been determined, (4) the transaction price has been allocated to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) the performance obligations have been satisfied. the majority of our shipping terms permit us to recognize revenue at point of shipment or delivery. certain shipping terms require the goods to be through customs or be received by the customer before title passes. in those instances, we defer the revenue recognized until title has passed. shipping costs are charged to selling, marketing, general and administrative expense as incurred. sales taxes are excluded from revenue.
revenue from contracts with the united states government, government prime contractors and certain commercial customers is recorded over time using either units delivered or costs incurred as the measurement basis for progress toward completion. these measures are used to measure results directly and is generally the best measure of progress toward completion in circumstances in which a reliable measure of output can be established. estimated revenue in excess of amounts billed is reported as unbilled receivables. contract accounting requires judgment in estimating costs and assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedule. contract costs include material, subcontract costs, labor and an allocation of indirect costs. the estimation of costs at completion of a contract is subject to numerous variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract. changes in contract performance, estimated gross margin, including the impact of final contract settlements, and estimated losses are recognized in the period in which the changes or losses are determined.
performance obligations: substantially all of our contracts with customers contain a single performance obligation, the sale of mixed-signal integrated circuit (ic) products. such sales represent a single performance obligation because the sale is one type of good or includes multiple goods that are neither capable of being distinct nor separable from the other promises in the contract. this performance obligation is satisfied when control of the product is transferred to the customer, which occurs upon shipment or delivery. unsatisfied performance obligations primarily represent contracts for products with future delivery dates and with an original expected duration of one year or less. as allowed under asu 2014-09, we have opted to not disclose the amount of unsatisfied performance obligations as these contracts have original expected durations of less than one year. we generally warrant that our products will meet their published specifications, and that we will repair or replace defective products, for one year from the date title passes from us to the customer. specific accruals are recorded for known product warranty issues.
transaction price: the transaction price reflects our expectations about the consideration we will be entitled to receive from the customer and may include fixed or variable amounts. fixed consideration primarily includes sales to direct customers and sales to distributors in which both the sale to the distributor and the sale to the end customer occur within the same reporting period. variable consideration includes sales in which the amount of consideration that we will receive is unknown as of the end of a reporting period. such consideration primarily includes credits issued to the distributor due to price protection and sales made to distributors under agreements that allow certain rights of return, referred to as stock rotation. price protection represents price discounts granted to certain distributors to allow the distributor to earn an appropriate margin on sales negotiated with certain customers and in the event of a price decrease subsequent to the date the product was shipped and billed to the distributor. stock rotation allows distributors limited levels of returns in order to reduce the amounts of slow-moving, discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory. a liability for distributor credits covering variable consideration is made based on management's estimate of historical experience rates as well as considering economic conditions and contractual terms. to date, actual distributor claims activity has been materially consistent with the provisions we have made based on our historical estimates.
contract balances: accounts receivable represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from our customers. payments are typically due within 30 to 45 days of invoicing and do not include a significant financing component. to date, there have been no material impairment losses on accounts receivable. there were no material contract assets or contract liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets in any of the periods presented.
inventory valuation we value inventories at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write down inventories to net realizable value. we employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory. while a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations, an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory. if actual demand for our products is less than our estimates, additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods. to date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates, and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future.
long-lived assets we review property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. recoverability of these assets is determined by comparison of their carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining estimated lives. if such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property, plant, and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods. evaluation of impairment of long-lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long-lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. these differences could result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. in addition, in certain instances, assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased. in these situations, we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives.
goodwill goodwill is subject to impairment tests annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable, utilizing either the qualitative or quantitative method. we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which we determined is consistent with our eight identified operating segments, on an annual basis on the first day of the fourth quarter (on or about august 2) or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist or we reorganize our operating segments or reporting units.
we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its net book value. when using the qualitative method, we consider several factors, including the following:
-the amount by which the fair values of each reporting unit exceeded their carrying values as of the date of the most recent quantitative impairment analysis, which indicated there would need to be substantial negative developments in the markets in which these reporting units operate in order for there to be potential impairment;
-the carrying values of these reporting units as of the assessment date compared to their previously calculated fair values as of the date of the most recent quantitative impairment analysis;
-the current forecasts as compared to the forecasts included in the most recent quantitative impairment analysis;
-public information from competitors and other industry information to determine if there were any significant adverse trends in our competitors' businesses;
-changes in the value of major u.s. stock indices that could suggest declines in overall market stability that could impact the valuation of our reporting units;
-changes in our market capitalization and overall enterprise valuation to determine if there were any significant decreases that could be an indication that the valuation of our reporting units had significantly decreased; and
-whether there had been any significant increases to the weighted-average cost of capital rates for each reporting unit, which could materially lower our prior valuation conclusions under a discounted cash flow approach.
if we elect not to use this option, or we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its net book value, then we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. the quantitative goodwill impairment test requires an entity to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. if fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount of the carrying value that exceeds the amount of the reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. additionally, we consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. we determine the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of the income and market approaches. under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow methodology which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted revenues, gross profit margins, operating income margins, working capital cash flow, perpetual growth rates, and long-term discount rates, among others. for the market approach, we use the guideline public company method. under this method we utilize information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units, to create valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested, in order to obtain their respective fair values. in order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated reporting unit fair values, we reconcile the aggregate fair values of our reporting units determined, as described above, to our total company market capitalization, allowing for a reasonable control premium.
in fiscal 2019, we used the qualitative method of assessing goodwill for seven of our eight reporting units and the quantitative method for one reporting unit. during the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we performed a quantitative assessment of one of our reporting units due to the macroeconomic climate at that time. in our latest annual impairment evaluation that occurred as of august 2, 2020, we elected to use the quantitative method of assessing goodwill for all eight of our reporting units. in all periods presented, we concluded the reporting units' fair values exceeded their carrying amounts as of the assessment dates and no risk of impairment existed.
business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting, we recognize tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. we record the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the value of the net assets acquired as goodwill. the accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets and the fair value of contingent payment obligations. critical estimates in valuing purchased technology, customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could experience impairment charges which could be material. in addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. if our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed.
we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. we generally determine the fair value of the contingent consideration using the income approach methodology of valuation. each reporting period thereafter, we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating expenses within the consolidated statements of income. changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration can result from changes in assumed discount periods and rates, and from changes pertaining to the achievement of the defined milestones. significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. accordingly, future business and economic conditions, as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above, can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period.
accounting for income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of certain expenses for tax and financial statement purposes. we assess the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and record a corresponding valuation allowance as necessary if we determine those deferred tax assets may not be realized due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount to be realized of certain state and international tax credit carryovers. in reaching our conclusion, we evaluate certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to realize deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state and international jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years. our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in u.s. or international tax laws and other factors. these changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, which may result in an increase or decrease to our income tax provision in future periods.
we account for uncertain tax positions by first determining if it is "more likely than not" that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities prior to recording any benefit in the financial statements. an uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. we classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes line of the consolidated statements of income. we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. this evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in known facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new guidance on legislative interpretations. a change in these factors could result in the recognition of an increase or decrease to our income tax provision, which could materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
in the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities. although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and income tax liabilities. in the event our assumptions are incorrect, the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. in addition to the factors described above, our current and expected effective tax rate is based on then-current tax law. significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates.
see note 12, income taxes, of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further discussion.
stock-based compensation stock-based compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards is recognized in the consolidated statements of income. determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant-date fair value of stock options and market-based restricted stock units. we calculate the grant-date fair values of stock options using the black-scholes valuation model. the use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of key assumptions such as expected option term and stock price volatility to determine the fair value of a stock option. the estimate of these key assumptions is based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends. we recognize the expense related to equity awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. see note 2r, stock-based compensation, and note 3, stock-based compensation and shareholders' equity, of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for more information related to stock-based compensation.
contingencies from time to time, in the ordinary course of business, various claims, charges and litigation are asserted or commenced against us arising from, or related to, among other things, contractual matters, patents, trademarks, personal injury, environmental matters, product liability, insurance coverage, employment or employment benefits. we periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded. in making this determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. based on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. if a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, we record a contingent loss. in determining the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. if the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations.
item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure our interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. in this regard, changes in interest rates affect the interest earned or paid on our marketable securities and debt, as well as the fair value of our investments and debt.
based on the $925.0 million of our floating rate debt outstanding as of october 31, 2020, our annual interest expense would change by approximately $9.3 million for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates.
in certain instances we utilize interest rate derivatives to manage interest rate exposure on both outstanding debt as well as future issuances. as of october 31, 2020 and november 2, 2019, for each 100 basis point decrease in the ten-year u.s. treasury rate, the fair value of our outstanding derivative instruments would change by approximately $102.0 million and $100.0 million, respectively.
based on our marketable securities outstanding as of october 31, 2020 and november 2, 2019, our annual interest income would change by approximately $10.6 million and $6.5 million, respectively, for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates.
to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. based on investment positions as of october 31, 2020 and november 2, 2019, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would not materially impact the fair market value of the portfolio in either period. if significant, such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity.
as of october 31, 2020, we had $4.3 billion in principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding, with a fair value of $4.8 billion. the fair value of our notes is subject to interest rate risk, market risk, and other factors. generally, the fair value of our notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. the fair values of our notes as of october 31, 2020 and november 2, 2019, assuming a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates, are as follows:
october 31, 2020                                                                                                                                           november 2, 2019

foreign currency exposure as more fully described in note 2i, derivative and hedging agreements, of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k, we regularly hedge our non-u.s. dollar-based exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts. the terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one to twelve months. currently, our largest foreign currency exposure is the euro, primarily because our european operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses. relative to foreign currency exposures existing at october 31, 2020 and november 2, 2019, a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of the year would result in approximately $18.5 million of losses and $12.1 million of losses, respectively, in changes in earnings or cash flows.
the market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rates that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. the counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings. based on the credit ratings of our counterparties as of october 31, 2020, we do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by them. while the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions, they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk. the amounts potentially subject to credit risk (arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties' obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties.
the following table illustrates the effect that a 10% unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, relative to the u.s. dollar, would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of october 31, 2020 and november 2, 2019:
october 31, 2020        november 2, 2019
fair value of forward exchange contracts assets                                                                            $5,427                  $-
fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates asset         $21,859                 $20,810
fair value of forward exchange contracts after a 10% favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates liability       $(20,276)               $(19,269)
the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the u.s. dollar. in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates, such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors' products become more or less attractive. our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices.
report of independent registered public accounting firm the board of directors and shareholders analog devices, inc.
opinion on the financial statements we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of analog devices, inc. (the company) as of october 31, 2020 and november 2, 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended october 31, 2020, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index at item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the company at october 31, 2020 and november 2, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended october 31, 2020, in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles.
we also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states) (pcaob), the company's internal control over financial reporting as of october 31, 2020, based on criteria established in internal control-integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (2013 framework), and our report dated november 24, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
adoption of asu no. 2016-02
as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the company changed its method of accounting for leases in the year ended october 31, 2020 due to the adoption of accounting standards update (asu) no. 2016-02, leases (topic 842), and the related amendments.
adoption of asu no. 2016-16
as discussed in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the company changed its method of accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers, other than inventory, in the year ended november 2, 2019 due to the adoption of asu no. 2016-16, income taxes (topic 740): intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory.
basis for opinion these financial statements are the responsibility of the company's management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's financial statements based on our audits. we are a public accounting firm registered with the pcaob and are required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with the u.s. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the pcaob.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the pcaob. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
critical audit matters the critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. the communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
revenue recognition - measuring variable consideration description of the matter                       as described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the company's sales contracts provide certain distributors with credits for price protection and rights of return, which results in variable consideration. during 2020, sales to distributors were $3.2 billion net of expected price protection discounts and rights of return for which the liability balance as of october 31, 2020 was $229.8 million.auditing the company's measurement of variable consideration under distributor contracts involved especially challenging judgment because the calculation involves subjective management assumptions about estimates of expected price protection discounts and returns. for example, estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price reflects management's evaluation of contractual terms, historical experience and assumptions about future economic conditions. changes in those assumptions can have a material effect on the amount of variable consideration recognized.
how we addressed the matter in our audit        we obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the company's process to calculate the variable consideration. for example, we tested controls over the appropriateness of assumptions management used as well as controls over the completeness and accuracy of the data underlying estimates of expected price protection discounts and returns.our audit procedures included, among others, inspecting contractual terms in distributor agreements and testing the underlying data used in management's calculation for completeness and accuracy as well as evaluating the significant assumptions used in the estimation of variable consideration. we evaluated the company's methods and assumptions used in the estimates, which included comparing the assumptions to historical trends. we inspected and tested the results of the company's retrospective review analysis of actual returns and price protection discounts claimed by distributors, evaluated the estimates made based on historical experience and performed sensitivity analyses of the company's significant assumptions to assess the impact on the variable consideration. we also evaluated whether the company appropriately considered new information that could significantly change the estimated future price protection discounts or returns.
goodwill - quantitative impairment assessment description of the matter                       the company's consolidated goodwill balance was $12.3 billion as of october 31, 2020. as described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually and performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for each of its eight reporting units. the quantitative impairment assessment involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its respective carrying amount. the company used a weighting of the income and market approaches to determine the fair value of each reporting unit. auditing management's quantitative goodwill impairment test involved a high degree of auditor judgment due to the significant estimation required to determine the fair value of each reporting unit. in particular, the fair value estimate for one of the eight reporting units was sensitive to significant assumptions, such as forecasted revenues, gross profit margins, operating income margins, long-term discount rate, perpetual growth rate, identification of comparable publicly traded companies and estimated valuation multiples, which led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management's significant assumptions as outlined above, used in determining the fair value of this reporting unit.
how we addressed the matter in our audit        we obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the company's quantitative goodwill impairment assessment process. for example, we tested controls over management's review of the valuation model and the significant assumptions used.to test the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, our audit procedures included, among others, assessing methodologies and testing the significant assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used by the company in its analysis. we tested significant assumptions by comparing them to current and forecasted industry and economic trends, analyst reports, and forecasted peer company information. we evaluated management's ability to accurately forecast by comparing actual results to historical forecasts. we also performed sensitivity analyses of certain assumptions to evaluate changes in the fair value that would result from changes in the assumptions. with the assistance of our valuation specialists, we evaluated the selection of the long-term discount rate and perpetual growth rate, including testing the underlying source information and the mathematical accuracy of the calculations by developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the rates selected by management. we also involved our valuation specialists to evaluate the market approach, including evaluating the reasonableness of the selected comparable publicly traded companies and the resulting market multiples calculation.

item 1a. risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10-k, including the management's discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations section and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. if any of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors described below actually occur or continue to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. moreover, the risks below are not the only risks we face and additional risks not currently known to us or that we presently deem immaterial may emerge or become material at any time and may negatively impact our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations or the trading price of our common stock.
risks related to macroeconomic conditions
•our financial condition and results of operations have been and are expected to continue to be adversely affected by the covid-19 pandemic.
in december 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, known as covid-19, was first reported and was subsequently declared a pandemic by the world health organization in march 2020. to date, this outbreak has surfaced in nearly all regions around the world, and as the pandemic continues to spread, particularly in the united states, businesses as well as federal, state and local governments have implemented significant actions to attempt to mitigate this public health crisis. our operations have been and will continue to be disrupted to varying degrees in many markets (from limited operations including only drive-thru and delivery to full store closures in some markets). while we cannot predict the duration or scope of the covid-19 pandemic, it has negatively impacted our business and such impact has been and is expected to continue to be material to our financial results, condition and outlook.
the further spread of covid-19, and the requirements to take action to mitigate the spread of the pandemic, will impact our ability to carry out our business as usual and may materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. even in regions where we have reopened stores, our stores may be subject to modified hours and operations and/or reduced customer traffic. moreover, certain of those regions, including parts of china and the united states, have suffered a covid-19 relapse after reopening. if those regions fail to fully contain covid-19, or if additional regions suffer multiple covid-19 relapses, any of those markets may not recover quickly or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. as a result, we may incur additional impairment charges to our inventory, store and corporate assets- and our ability to realize the benefits from deferred tax assets may become limited- any of which may have a significant or material impact on our financial results. on march 27, 2020, the u.s. government enacted the coronavirus aid, relief and economic security act ("cares act"), which among other things, provides employer payroll tax credits for wages paid to employees who are unable to work during the covid-19 outbreak and options to defer payroll tax payments for a limited period. based on our evaluation of the cares act, we qualify for certain employer payroll tax credits as well as the deferral of payroll tax payments in the future. additionally, the canadian government enacted the canada emergency wage subsidy ("cews") to help employers offset a portion of their employee wages for a limited period. we elected to treat qualified government subsidies from the u.s., canada and other governments as offsets to the related operating expenses. there is no guarantee that we will continue to meet the eligibility requirements to participate in any current or future government relief programs or that the benefits will meaningfully offset the lost revenues and incremental costs incurred. increased volatility or significant disruption of global financial markets due in part to the covid-19 pandemic could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital markets and other funding sources, on acceptable terms or at all and impede our ability to comply with debt covenants.
the extent to which covid-19 impacts our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of covid-19 and the efficacy, scope and duration of actions to limit the spread of covid-19 or treat its impact, among others. while such actions have been relaxed or rolled back in certain markets, the actions have been reinstated in certain regions that have suffered relapse, and may be reinstated in additional regions as the pandemic continues to evolve. the scope and timing of any such reinstatements are difficult to predict and may materially affect our future operations.
•our financial condition and results of operations are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, a number of other factors, many of which are also largely outside our control.
in addition to the covid-19 pandemic, our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to a number of other factors, many of which are largely outside our control. any one or more of the factors listed below or described elsewhere in this risk factors section could have a material adverse impact our business, financial condition and/or results of operations:
•increases in real estate costs in certain domestic and international markets;
•adverse outcomes of litigation;
•severe weather or other natural or man-made disasters affecting a large market or several closely located markets that may temporarily but significantly affect our retail business in such markets; and
•especially in our large markets, labor discord or disruption, geopolitical events (including escalating u.s.-china tensions), war, terrorism (including incidents targeting us), political instability, acts of public violence, boycotts, increasing anti-american sentiment in certain markets, hostilities and social unrest and other health pandemics that lead to avoidance of public places or restrictions on public gatherings such as in our stores.
•economic conditions in the u.s. and international markets could adversely affect our business and financial results.
as a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending, our results of operations are sensitive to changes in or uncertainty about macro-economic conditions. our customers may have or in the future have less money for discretionary purchases and may stop or reduce their purchases of our products or switch to starbucks or competitors' lower-priced products as a result of various factors, including job losses, inflation, higher taxes, reduced access to credit, changes in federal economic policy and recent international trade disputes. due to the covid-19 pandemic, we may experience a reduction and/or increased volatility in demand for our products, which may be caused by, among other things: store closures or modified operating hours and business model, reduced customer traffic due to illness, quarantine or government or self-imposed restrictions placed on our stores' operations and changes in consumer spending behaviors (e.g. continued practice of social distancing, decrease in consumer confidence in general macroeconomic conditions and a decrease in consumer discretionary spending). decreases in customer traffic and/or average value per transaction without a corresponding decrease in costs would put downward pressure on margins and would negatively impact our financial results. there is also a risk that if negative economic conditions or uncertainty, as a result of the covid-19 pandemic or otherwise, persist for a long period of time or worsen, consumers may make long-lasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior, including less frequent discretionary purchases on a more permanent basis or there may be a general downturn in the restaurant industry.
•failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance and fluctuations in the stock market as a whole will likely adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.
failure to meet market expectations going forward, particularly with respect to net revenues, operating margins, earnings per share, comparable store sales growth, operating cash flows and shareholder returns, will likely result in a decline and/or increased volatility in the market price of our stock. in addition, price and volume fluctuations in the stock market as a whole may affect the market price of our stock in ways that may be unrelated to our financial performance.
risks related to brand relevance and brand execution
•our success depends substantially on the value of our brands and failure to preserve their value could have a negative impact on our financial results.
we believe we have built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of our products, for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience and for our global social impact programs. the starbucks brand is recognized throughout the world, and we have received high ratings in global brand value studies. to be successful in the future, particularly outside of the u.s. where the starbucks brand and our other brands are less well-known, we believe we must preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brands across all sales channels. brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities.
business incidents, whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us or our business partners, that erode consumer trust can significantly reduce brand value, potentially trigger boycotts of our stores or result in civil or criminal liability and can have a negative impact on our financial results. such incidents include actual or perceived breaches of privacy or violations of domestic or international privacy laws, contaminated food, product recalls, store employees or other food handlers infected with communicable diseases, such as covid-19, or other potential incidents discussed in this risk factors section. the impact of such incidents may be exacerbated if they receive considerable publicity, including rapidly through social or digital media (including for malicious reasons) or result in litigation. consumer demand for our products and our brand equity could diminish significantly if we, our employees, licensees or other business partners fail to preserve the quality of our products, act or are perceived to act in an unethical, illegal, racially-biased, unequal or socially irresponsible manner, including with respect to the sourcing, content or sale of our products, service and treatment of customers at starbucks stores, or the use of customer data for general or direct marketing or other purposes. additionally, if we fail to comply with laws and regulations, publicly take controversial positions or actions or fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience in each of our markets, including by failing to invest in the right balance of wages and benefits to attract and retain employees that represent the brand well or foster an inclusive and diverse environment, our brand value may be diminished.
•if our business partners and third-party providers do not satisfactorily fulfill their responsibilities and commitments, it could damage our brand and our financial results could suffer.
our global business strategy, including our plans for new stores, branded products and other initiatives, relies significantly on a variety of business partners, including licensee and joint venture relationships, third-party manufacturers, distributors and retailers, particularly for our entire global channel development business. licensees, retailers and foodservice operators are often authorized to use our logos and provide branded food, beverage and other products directly to customers. we believe our customers expect the same quality of service regardless of whether they visit a licensed or company-operated store, so we provide training and support to, and monitor the operations of, certain of these licensees and other business partners. however, the product quality and service they deliver may still be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. we do not have direct control over our business partners, including in their adherence to additional sanitation protocols and guidelines as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, and may not have visibility into their practices.
we also source our food, beverage and other products from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners and in certain cases such products are produced or sourced by our licensees directly. and although foodservice operators are authorized to use our logos and provide branded products as part of their foodservice business, we do not monitor the quality of non-starbucks products served in those locations. additionally, inconsistent uses of our brand and other of our intellectual property assets, as well as failure to protect our intellectual property, can erode consumer trust and our brand value and have a material negative impact on our financial results.
•incidents involving food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, adulteration, contamination or mislabeling, whether or not accurate, as well as adverse public or medical opinions about the health effects of consuming our products, could harm our business.
instances or reports, whether true or not, of unclean water supply or food-safety issues, such as food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, adulteration, contamination or mislabeling, either during growing, manufacturing, packaging, storing or preparation, have in the past severely injured the reputations of companies in the food and beverage processing, grocery and quick-service restaurant sectors. any report linking us to such instances could severely hurt our sales and could possibly lead to product liability claims, litigation (including class actions) and/or temporary store closures. clean water is critical to the preparation of coffee, tea and other beverages, as well as ice for our cold beverages, and our ability to ensure a clean water and ice supply to our stores can be limited, particularly in some international locations. we are also continuing to incorporate more products in our food and beverage lineup that require freezing or refrigeration, which increases the risk of food safety related incidents if correct temperatures are not maintained due to mechanical malfunction or human error.
we also face risk by relying on third-party food suppliers to provide and transport ingredients and finished products to our stores. we monitor the operations of certain of these business partners, but the product quality and service they deliver may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control and it may be difficult to detect contamination or other defect in these products. furthermore, due to the covid-19 pandemic, there are stricter health regulations and guidelines and increased public concern over food safety standards and controls. potential food safety incidents, whether at our stores or involving our business partners, could lead to wide public exposure, which could materially harm our business.
additionally, we are evolving our product lineup to include more local or smaller suppliers for some of our products who may not have as rigorous quality and safety systems and protocols as larger or more national suppliers, especially in light of the heightened safety protocols as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. in addition, instances of food or beverage-safety issues, even those involving solely the restaurants or stores of competitors or of suppliers or distributors (regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors), could, by resulting in negative publicity about us or the foodservice industry in general, adversely affect our sales on a regional or global basis. a decrease in customer traffic as a result of food-safety concerns or negative publicity, or as a result of a temporary closure of any of our stores, product recalls, viral-contaminated food or beverage claims or other food or beverage-safety claims or litigation, could materially harm our business and results of operations.
•we may not be successful in implementing important strategic initiatives or effectively managing growth, which may have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.
there is no assurance that we will be able to implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations or that they will generate expected returns, which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results. these strategic initiatives are designed to create growth, improve our results of operations and drive long-term shareholder value, and include:
•being an employer of choice and investing in employees to deliver a superior customer experience;
•building our leadership position around coffee;
•driving convenience, brand engagement and digital relationships through our mobile, loyalty, delivery and digital capabilities both domestically and internationally;
•simplifying store administrative tasks to allow store partners to better engage with customers;
•increasing the scale of the starbucks store footprint with disciplined global expansion and introducing flexible and unique store formats, including the accelerated development of alternative store formats (such as starbucks® pickup stores, starbucks now stores and curbside pickup) in light of the covid-19 pandemic;
•adjusting rapidly to changing customer preferences and behaviors in light of the covid-19 pandemic;
•moving to a more licensed store model in some markets and a more company-owned model in other markets;
•creating new occasions in stores across all dayparts with new product offerings, including our growing lunch food and beverage product lineup;
•continuing the global growth of our channel development business through our supply, distribution and licensing agreements with nestlé and other channel development business partners;
•delivering continued growth in our cold beverage business, including our tea business through the teavana brand in our starbucks® retail stores and other channels and internationally; and
•reducing our operating costs, particularly general and administrative expenses.
in addition to other factors listed in this risk factors section, factors that may adversely affect the successful implementation of these initiatives, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results, include the following:
•imposition of additional taxes by jurisdictions, such as on certain types of beverages or based on number of employees;
•construction cost increases associated with new store openings and remodeling of existing stores; delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control or a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates, either of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets in the u.s. and internationally;
•governmental regulations or other health guidelines concerning operations of stores due to the covid-19 pandemic;
•not successfully scaling our supply chain infrastructure as our product offerings increase and as we continue to expand, including our emphasis on a broad range of high-quality food offerings; and
•the deterioration in our credit ratings, which could limit the availability of additional financing and increase the cost of obtaining financing to fund our initiatives.
effectively managing growth can be challenging, particularly as we expand into new markets internationally where we must balance the need for flexibility and a degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with our goals, philosophy and standards. if we are not successful in implementing our strategic initiatives, such as large acquisitions and integrations, we may be required to evaluate whether certain assets, including goodwill and other intangibles, have become impaired. in the event we record an impairment charge, it could have a material impact on our financial results.
•evolving consumer preferences and tastes may adversely affect our business.
our continued success depends on our ability to retain and convert customers. our financial results could be adversely affected by a shift in consumer spending away from outside-the-home food and beverages (such as the disruption caused by online commerce that results in reduced foot traffic to "brick & mortar" retail stores); lack of customer acceptance of new products (including due to price increases necessary to cover the costs of new products or higher input costs), brands (such as the global expansion of the starbucks brand) and platforms (such as features of our mobile technology, changes in our loyalty rewards programs and our delivery services initiatives); or customers reducing their demand for our current offerings as new products are introduced. in addition, some of our products contain caffeine, dairy products, sugar and other compounds and allergens, the health effects of which are the subject of public and regulatory scrutiny, including the suggestion of linkages to a variety of adverse health effects. particularly in the u.s., there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks, including obesity, as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food and beverage products. while we have a variety of beverage and food items, including items that are coffee-free and have reduced calories, an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products, whether accurate or not, imposition of additional taxes on certain types of food and beverage components, or negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our beverages and food products and could materially harm our business and results of operations. furthermore, our financial results have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the impact of the covid-19 pandemic, which has resulted in a disruption of customer routines, changes to employer "work-
from-home" policies, reduced business and recreational travel and changes in consumer behavior and the ability or willingness to spend discretionary income on our products.
risks related to cybersecurity and data privacy
•the unauthorized access, use, theft or destruction of customer or employee personal, financial or other data or of starbucks proprietary or confidential information that is stored in our information systems or by third parties on our behalf could impact our reputation and brand and expose us to potential liability and loss of revenues.
many of our information technology systems (and those of our licensees and other third-party business partners, whether cloud-based or hosted in proprietary servers), including those used for our point-of-sale, web and mobile platforms, online and mobile payment systems, delivery services and rewards programs and administrative functions, contain personal, financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and employees. many of our information technology systems also contain starbucks proprietary and other confidential information related to our business, such as business plans, product development initiatives and designs. similar to many other retail companies and because of the prominence of our brand, we are consistently subject to attempts to compromise our information technology systems. similar to other companies, the number and frequency of these attempts varies from year to year but could be exacerbated to some extent by an increase in our digital operations in our efforts to comply with state and local mandates in response to covid-19. to the extent we or a third party were to experience a material breach of our or such third parties' information technology systems that result in the unauthorized access, theft, use, destruction or other compromises of customers' or employees' data or confidential information of the company stored in such systems, including through cyber-attacks or other external or internal methods, it could result in a material loss of revenues from the potential adverse impact to our reputation and brand, our ability to retain or attract new customers and the potential disruption to our business and plans. such security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable u.s. and international privacy and other laws, and subject us to private consumer, business partner, or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability. for example, the european union adopted a new regulation that became effective in may 2018, called the general data protection regulation ("gdpr"), which requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data, including its use, protection and transfer and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves. failure to meet the gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of annual worldwide revenue. the gdpr also confers a private right of action on certain individuals and associations. additionally, the california privacy act of 2018 ("ccpa"), which was enacted in june 2018 and came into effect on january 1, 2020, provides a new private right of action for data breaches and requires companies that process information on california residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices and allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties. our reputation and brand and our ability to attract new customers could also be adversely impacted if we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to properly respond to security breaches of our or third party's information technology systems. such failure to properly respond could also result in similar exposure to liability.
compliance with the gdpr, the ccpa and other current and future applicable international and u.s. privacy, cybersecurity and related laws can be costly and time-consuming. significant capital investments and other expenditures could also be required to remedy cybersecurity problems and prevent future breaches, including costs associated with additional security technologies, personnel, experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached. these costs, which could be material, could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred and may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems.
media or other reports of existing or perceived security vulnerabilities in our systems or those of our third-party business partners or service providers can also adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially impact our business. additionally, the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyber-attacks and breach information technology systems, as well as the sources and targets of these attacks, change frequently and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time. we continue to make significant investments in technology, third-party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and to prevent or minimize breaches of our information technology systems or data loss, but these security measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss.
•we rely heavily on information technology in our operations and growth initiatives, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate and grow our business and could adversely affect our financial results.
we rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations for numerous purposes including for administrative functions, point-of-sale processing and payment in our stores and online, management of our supply chain, starbucks cards, online business, delivery services, mobile technology, including mobile payments and ordering apps, reloads and loyalty functionality and various other processes and transactions, and many of these systems are interdependent on one another for their functionality. additionally, the success of several of our initiatives to drive growth, including our ability to increase digital relationships with our customers to drive incremental traffic and spend, is highly dependent on our technology systems. furthermore, due to social distancing measures put in place as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, we have accelerated the transformation of our store portfolio by expanding convenience-led formats, which depend heavily on our mobile ordering capabilities. we also rely on third-party providers and platforms for some of these information technology systems and support. additionally, our systems hardware, software and services provided by third-party service providers are not fully redundant within a market or across our markets. although we have operational safeguards in place, they may not be effective in preventing the failure of these systems or platforms to operate effectively and be available. such failures may be caused by various factors, including power outages, catastrophic events, physical theft, computer and network failures, inadequate or ineffective redundancy, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or platforms, flaws in third-party software or services, errors or improper use by our employees or third party service providers, or a breach in the security of these systems or platforms, including through cyber-attacks such as those that result in the blockage of our or our third-party business partners' or service providers' systems and platforms and those discussed in more detail in this risk factors section. if our incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective manner they could result in an interruption in our operations and could cause material negative impacts to our product availability and sales, the efficiency of our operations and our financial results. in addition, remediation of any problems with our systems could result in significant, unplanned expenses.
risks related to labor and supply chain
• our reliance on key business partners may adversely affect our business and operations.
the growth of our business relies on the ability of our licensee partners to implement our growth platforms and product innovations as well as on the degree to which we are able to enter into, maintain, develop and negotiate appropriate terms and conditions of, and enforce, commercial and other agreements and the performance of our business partners under such agreements. our international joint venture partners or licensees may face capital constraints or other factors that may limit the speed at which they are able to expand and develop in a certain market. our channel development business is heavily reliant on nestlé, which acquired the right to sell and distribute our packaged goods and foodservice products to retailers and operators, with few exceptions. if nestlé fails to perform its distribution and marketing commitments under our agreements and/or fails to support, protect and grow our brand in channel development, our channel development business could be adversely impacted for a period of time, present long-term challenges to our brand, limit our ability to grow our channel development business and have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results. additionally, the growth of our channel development business is in part dependent on the level of discretionary support provided by our retail and licensed store businesses.
there are generally a relatively small number of licensee partners operating in specific markets. if they are not able to access sufficient funds or financing, or are otherwise unable or unwilling to successfully operate and grow their businesses it could have a material adverse effect on our results in the markets. our business partners may be materially adversely impacted by the covid-19 pandemic and may not have sufficient financial support and capital to remain financially solvent and may not have the ability to meet their development goals and targets.
due to the covid-19 pandemic, our financial results have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the disruption to the operations of our business partners, including licensee and joint venture relationships, third-party manufacturers, distributors and retailers, through the effects of business and facilities closures, reductions in operating hours, social, economic, political or labor instability in affected areas, transportation delays, travel restrictions and changes in operating procedures, including for additional cleaning and safety protocols.
•increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities or decreases in the availability of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.
the availability and prices of coffee beans and other commodities are subject to significant volatility. we purchase, roast and sell high-quality whole bean arabica coffee beans and related coffee products. the high-quality arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the "c" price. this premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly. increases in the "c" coffee commodity price increase the price of high-quality arabica coffee and also impact our ability to enter into fixed-price purchase commitments. we frequently enter into supply contracts whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore price, at which the base "c" coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established.
the supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, such as weather (including the potential effects of climate change), natural disasters, crop disease, general increase in farm inputs and costs of production, inventory levels, political and economic conditions and the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies. speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices. because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations, combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities, increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. in addition, if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or to a worldwide or regional shortage, we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee, which could have a material adverse impact on our profitability.
we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products, particularly fluid milk, to support the needs of our company-operated retail stores. additionally, and although less significant to our operations than coffee or dairy, other commodities, including but not limited to tea and those related to food and beverage inputs, such as cocoa, produce, baking ingredients, meats, eggs and energy, as well as the processing of these inputs, are important to our operations. increases in the cost of dairy products and other commodities, or lack of availability, whether due to supply shortages, delays or interruptions in processing, or otherwise, especially in international markets, could have a material adverse impact on our profitability.
•interruption of our supply chain could affect our ability to produce or deliver our products and could negatively impact our business and profitability.
any material interruption in our supply chain, such as material interruption of roasted coffee supply due to the casualty loss of any of our roasting plants, interruptions in service by our third-party logistic service providers or common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels, trade restrictions, such as increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes or customs restrictions, pandemics, social or labor unrest, natural disasters or political disputes and military conflicts that cause a material disruption in our supply chain could have a negative material impact on our business and our profitability. additionally, our food, beverage and other products are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply chain operations, and in certain cases are produced or sourced by our licensees directly. we rely on these suppliers to provide high quality products and to comply with applicable laws. our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge as we increase our fresh and prepared food offerings, especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the u.s. and from countries or regions with diminished infrastructure, developing or failing economies or which are experiencing political instability or social unrest. for certain products, we may rely on one or very few suppliers. a supplier's failure to meet our standards, provide products in a timely and efficient manner, or comply with applicable laws is beyond our control. these issues could have a material negative impact on our business and profitability.
•changes in the availability of and the cost of labor could adversely affect our business.
our business could be adversely impacted by increases in labor costs, including wages and benefits, which, in a retail business such as ours, are two of our most significant costs, both domestically and internationally, including those increases triggered by regulatory actions regarding wages, scheduling and benefits; increased health care and workers' compensation insurance costs; increased wages and costs of other benefits necessary to attract and retain high quality employees with the right skill sets and increased wages, benefits and costs related to the covid-19 pandemic. the growth of our business can make it increasingly difficult to locate and hire sufficient numbers of key employees, to maintain an effective system of internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise and to train employees worldwide to deliver a consistently high-quality product and customer experience, which could materially harm our business and results of operations. furthermore, due to the covid-19 pandemic, we could experience a shortage of labor for store positions as concern over exposure to covid-19 and other factors could decrease the pool of available qualified talent for key functions. in addition, our wages and benefits programs, combined with the challenging conditions due to the covid-19 pandemic, may be insufficient to attract and retain the best talent.
•the loss of key personnel or difficulties recruiting and retaining qualified personnel could adversely impact our business and financial results.
much of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of senior management personnel. the loss of any of our executive officers or other key senior management personnel could harm our business. our success also depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our retail store employees on whom we rely to give customers a superior in-store experience and elevate our brand. accordingly, our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain high quality management personnel and other employees to work in and manage our stores, both domestically and internationally. our ability to attract and retain both corporate and retail personnel is also acutely impacted in certain international and domestic markets where the competition for a relatively small number of qualified employees is intense or in markets where large high-tech companies are able to offer more competitive salaries and benefits. additionally, there is intense competition for qualified technology systems developers necessary to develop and implement new technologies for our growth initiatives, including increasing our digital relationships with customers. if we are unable to recruit, retain and motivate employees sufficiently to maintain our current business and support our projected growth, our business and financial performance may be adversely affected.
risks related to competition
•we face intense competition in each of our channels and markets, which could lead to reduced profitability.
the specialty coffee market is intensely competitive, including with respect to product quality, innovation, service, convenience, such as delivery service and mobile ordering, and price, and we face significant and increasing competition in all these areas in each of our channels and markets. accordingly, we do not have leadership positions in all channels and markets. in the u.s., the ongoing focus by large competitors in the quick-service restaurant sector on selling high-quality specialty coffee beverages could lead to decreases in customer traffic to starbucks® stores and/or average value per transaction adversely affecting our sales and results of operations. similarly, continued competition from well-established competitors, or competition from large new entrants or well-funded smaller companies in our domestic and international markets could hinder growth and adversely affect our sales and results of operations in those markets. many small competitors also continue to open coffee specialty stores in many of our markets across the world, which in the aggregate may also lead to significant decreases of customer traffic to our stores in those markets. increased competition globally in packaged coffee and tea and single-serve and ready-to-drink coffee beverage markets, including from new and large entrants to this market, could adversely affect the profitability of the channel development segment. furthermore, declines in general consumer demand for specialty coffee products for any reason, including due to consumer preference for other products, flattening demand for our products, changed customer daily routines or traffic to stores as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, or changed customer spending behaviors due to challenging economic conditions, could have a negative effect on our business.
risks related to operating a global business
•we are highly dependent on the financial performance of our americas operating segment.
our financial performance is highly dependent on our americas operating segment, as it comprised approximately 70% of consolidated total net revenues in fiscal 2020. if the americas operating segment revenue trends slow or decline, or does not successfully recover in the post covid-19 environment, especially in our u.s. market, our other segments may be unable to make up any significant shortfall and our business and financial results could be adversely affected. and because the americas segment is relatively mature and produces the large majority of our operating cash flows, such a slowdown or decline could result in reduced cash flows for funding the expansion of our international businesses and other initiatives and for returning cash to shareholders.
•we are increasingly dependent on the success of certain international markets in order to achieve our growth targets.
our future growth increasingly depends on the growth and sustained profitability of certain international markets. some or all of our international market business units ("mbus"), which we generally define by the countries in which they operate, may not be successful in their operations or in achieving expected growth, which ultimately requires achieving consistent, stable net revenues and earnings. the performance of these international operations may be adversely affected by economic downturns in one or more of the countries in which our large mbus operate. a decline in performance of one or more of our significant international mbus could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results.
the international segment is a significant profit center driving our global returns, along with our americas segment. in particular, our china mbu contributes meaningfully to both consolidated and international net revenues and operating income. china is currently our fastest growing market, our second largest market overall and 100% company-owned. due to the significance of our china market for our profit and growth, we are exposed to risks in china, including the risks mentioned elsewhere and the following:
•the effects of current u.s.-china relations, including rounds of tariff increases and retaliations and increasing restrictive regulations, potential boycotts and increasing anti-americanism;
•escalating u.s.-china tension and increasing political sensitivities in china;
•the effects of the covid-19 pandemic and related governmental regulations and restrictions on our operations in china;
•entry of new competitors to the specialty coffee market in china;
•changes in economic conditions in china and potential negative effects to the growth of its middle class, wages, labor, inflation discretionary spending and real estate and supply chain costs;
•ongoing government regulatory reform, including relating to public health, food safety, tariffs and tax, sustainability, bringing uncertainty and inconsistent interpretations, which may be contrary to ours, as well as potential significant increases in compliance costs; and
•food-safety related matters, including compliance with food-safety regulations and ability to ensure product quality and safety.
additionally, some factors that will be critical to the success of our international operations overall are different than those affecting our u.s. stores and licensees. tastes naturally vary by region, and consumers in some mbus may not embrace our products to the same extent as consumers in the u.s. or other international markets. occupancy costs and store operating expenses can be higher internationally than in the u.s. due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance with country-specific regulatory requirements. because many of our international operations are in an early phase of development, operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to more developed operations.
•we face risks as a global business that could adversely affect our financial performance.
we operate in over 80 markets globally. our international operations are also subject to additional inherent risks of conducting business abroad, such as:
•foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, or requirements to transact in specific currencies;
•changes or uncertainties in economic, legal, regulatory, social and political conditions in our markets, as well as negative effects on u.s. businesses due to increasing anti-american sentiment in certain markets;
•interpretation and application of laws and regulations, including tax, tariffs, labor, merchandise, anti-bribery and privacy laws and regulations;
•uncertainties and effects of the implementation of the united kingdom's referendum to withdraw membership from the european union (referred to as "brexit"), including financial, legal, tax and trade implications;
•restrictive actions of foreign or u.s. governmental authorities affecting trade and foreign investment, especially during periods of heightened tension between the u.s. and such foreign governmental authorities, including protective measures such as export and customs duties and tariffs, government intervention favoring local competitors and restrictions on the level of foreign ownership;
•import or other business licensing requirements;
•the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights;
•limitations on the repatriation of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions due to current or new u.s. and international regulations;
•in developing economies, the growth rate in the portion of the population achieving sufficient levels of disposable income may not be as fast as we forecast;
•difficulty in staffing, developing and managing foreign operations and supply chain logistics, including ensuring the consistency of product quality and service, due to governmental actions affecting supply chain logistics, distance, language and cultural differences, as well as challenges in recruiting and retaining high quality employees in local markets;
•local laws that make it more expensive and complex to negotiate with, retain or terminate employees;
•local regulations, health guidelines and safety protocols related to the covid-19 pandemic affecting our store operations; and
•delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control, competition with locally relevant competitors or a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates, any of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets and, in turn, negatively impact net revenues, operating income and earnings per share.
moreover, many of the foregoing risks are particularly acute in developing countries, which are important to our long-term growth prospects.
risks related to governmental and regulatory changes
•failure to comply with applicable laws and changing legal and regulatory requirements could harm our business and financial results.
our policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws, accounting and reporting requirements, tax rules and other regulations and requirements, including those imposed by the sec, nasdaq and foreign countries, as well as applicable trade, labor, healthcare, food and beverage, sanitation, safety, environmental, labeling, anti-bribery and corruption and merchandise laws. changes in applicable environmental regulations, including increased or additional regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, to discourage the use of plastic or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use, may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, incremental investments and other financial obligations for us and our business partners, which could affect our profitability. furthermore, due to the covid-19
pandemic, we are subject to additional domestic and foreign governmental regulations and health guidelines, as well as any other voluntary safety protocols.
in addition, our business is subject to complex and rapidly evolving u.s. and international laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection, and companies are under increased regulatory scrutiny relating to these matters. the federal trade commission and many state attorneys general are also interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data. the interpretation and application of existing laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection are in flux and authorities around the world are considering a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals in this area. current and future data privacy and data protection laws and regulations (including the gdpr and the ccpa, discussed in more detail in this risk factors section, and other applicable international and u.s. privacy laws), or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may limit our ability to collect and use data, require us to otherwise modify our data processing practices and policies or result in the possibility of fines, litigation or orders, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. the burdens imposed by these and other laws and regulations that may be enacted, or new interpretations of existing and future laws and regulations, may also require us to incur substantial costs in reaching compliance in a manner adverse to our business.
in addition, the european commission in july 2016 and the swiss government in january 2017 approved the eu-u.s. and the swiss-u.s. privacy shield frameworks, respectively, which are designed to allow u.s. companies that self-certify to the u.s. department of commerce and publicly commit to comply with the privacy shield requirements to freely import personal data from the eu and switzerland. however, these frameworks face a number of legal challenges and their validity remains subject to legal, regulatory and political developments in both europe and the u.s. the eu-u.s. privacy shield framework approved by the european commission, which is relied upon for transfers of personal data outside the european economic area could be invalidated by the court of justice of the european union. the potential invalidation of this mechanism could have a significant adverse impact on our ability to process and transfer personal data outside of the european economic area.
the complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance are both increasing due to additional or changing legal and regulatory requirements, our ongoing expansion into new markets and new channels and the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic laws. in addition to potential damage to our reputation and brand, failure by us or our business partners to comply with the various applicable laws and regulations, as well as changes in laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied, may result in litigation, civil and criminal liability, damages, fines and penalties, increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of our financial statements and have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.
item 7.management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general our fiscal year ends on the sunday closest to september 30. all references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of related store closures, unless otherwise noted.
overview starbucks results for fiscal 2020 reflect the challenges our business faced with the covid-19 pandemic, which severely impacted our results, particularly during the second and third fiscal quarters. consolidated revenues declined 11% to $23.5 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to $26.5 billion in fiscal 2019 driven by temporary closures of a significant number of our company-operated and licensed stores, as well as modified business operations and reduced customer traffic. we gradually reopened our stores and, since then, have seen sequential improvements in comparable store sales in both our americas and international segments as transaction volumes continue to climb, reflecting the resilience of our business model and the strength of our brand.
comparable store sales for the americas segment declined by 12% for fiscal 2020, primarily due to the temporary store closures, reduced customer traffic and shortened store hours. the most negative impacts occurred during the third quarter of fiscal 2020. most company-operated and licensed stores were re-opened as of early may, and over 60% of company-operated stores in the u.s. provided limited seating by the end of the fiscal year. to help protect the health and welfare of our partners, we incurred incremental labor costs, including paying the wages and benefits to partners who were either unable or uncomfortable working from mid-march through may, a temporary wage increase for partners who continued working during this period and additional benefits to furloughed or separated partners resulting from reduced store hours. the incremental wages incurred were partially offset by qualified tax credits provided by the coronavirus aid, relief and economic security act ("cares act") and the canada emergency wage subsidy ("cews"). in june 2020, we announced a plan to optimize our north america store portfolio, primarily in dense, metropolitan markets, by blending store formats to better cater to changing customer tastes and preferences. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we closed approximately 100 stores in the u.s. and canada, and we expect to close an additional 700 stores in those markets over the next 18 months. this reflects an additional 200 store closures than the initial announcement estimate of 600 stores. costs incurred related to the restructuring efforts are recorded as restructuring and impairments on our consolidated statement of earnings and will continue to be recorded in accordance with the anticipated timeline of store closures.
for the international segment, comparable store sales declined by 19% for fiscal 2020, mostly due to the 31% and 37% reduction in comparable store sales during the second and third fiscal quarters of 2020, respectively. company-operated stores in the china market began re-opening in the fiscal second quarter, and nearly all company-operated stores were open by the end of the fiscal third quarter. to support our international licensees in their recovery efforts, we extended more flexible development and financial terms, including waiving royalty payments during the fiscal third quarter.
revenue for our channel development segment declined $68 million, or 3%, when compared with fiscal 2019. this is largely due to the lapping of global coffee alliance transition-related activities, including higher inventory sales in the prior year as nestlé prepared to fulfill customer orders. these are partially offset by the continued growth of the global coffee alliance during fiscal 2020.
throughout the second half of fiscal 2020, we experienced initial business recovery as our stores gradually reopened under modified operations to meet public health guidelines and evolving customer behaviors and expectations. as of september 27, 2020, nearly all of our company-operated and licensed stores were re-opened. those that have remained closed are located in travel or transportation hubs as well as central business districts. our global business is recovering steadily, with china approaching comparable store sales recovery and the u.s. demonstrating continued upward momentum in sales and profitability. our channel development segment continues to grow category share as customers adjust to their at-home routines. in fiscal 2021, we expect lower revenues for the segment as we transitioned our single-serve coffee business to a more royalty-based model. we do not expect the change to have a material impact on our earnings. however, the change is anticipated to have an accretive impact on operating margin for the segment.
we continue to invest in technologies and innovations to elevate the customer and partner experience and to drive long-term growth. by reimagining our store formats, we are moving swiftly to adapt to new customer behaviors. absent significant covid-19 relapses or global economic disruptions, and based on the current trend of our retail business recovery and our focused efforts to expand contactless customer experiences, digital capabilities and beverage innovation, we believe we are well positioned to regain the positive business momentum we had demonstrated prior to the pandemic.
financial highlights
•total net revenues decreased 11% to $23.5 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to $26.5 billion in fiscal 2019.
•consolidated operating income decreased to $1.6 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to operating income of $4.1 billion in fiscal 2019. fiscal 2020 operating margin was 6.6% compared to 15.4% in fiscal 2019. operating margin contraction was primarily driven by sales deleverage and additional costs incurred attributable to covid-19, including catastrophe pay and enhanced pay programs for retail store partners, net of benefits provided by government subsidies. higher restructuring activities related to our americas store portfolio optimization and investments to support key business partners also contributed. these decreases were partially offset by sales leverage realized in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 prior to the onset of covid-19 impacts and supply chain efficiencies.
•earnings per share ("eps") for fiscal 2020 decreased to $0.79, compared to eps of $2.92 in fiscal 2019. the decrease was primarily driven by the adverse impacts of covid-19, including lower revenues due to temporary store closures, reduced customer traffic and modified operations, as well as incremental labor expenses and restructuring costs.
•capital expenditures were $1.5 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to $1.8 billion in fiscal 2019 primarily due to a pause in new store openings due to covid-19.
•we returned $3.6 billion to our shareholders in fiscal 2020 through share repurchases and dividends compared to $12.0 billion in fiscal 2019. we temporarily suspended our share repurchase program in march 2020.

total net revenues decreased $3.0 billion, or 11%, over fiscal 2019, primarily due to lower revenues from company-operated stores ($2.4 billion). the decline in company-operated store revenue was due to a 14% decrease in comparable store sales ($2.9 billion), attributable to a 22% decrease in comparable transactions, partially offset by a 10% increase in average ticket. also contributing to the decrease were the conversions of our retail businesses in thailand, france and the netherlands to fully licensed markets during fiscal 2019 ($204 million). partially offsetting these decreases were the incremental revenues from 806 net new starbucks® company-operated store openings, or a 5% increase, over the past 12 months ($718 million).
licensed stores revenue declined by $548 million, driven by lower product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees.
other revenues decreased $63 million, primarily due to the lapping of a higher volume of transition activities related to the global coffee alliance and the tazo brand sale, partially offset by higher sales from the growth of the global coffee alliance.

store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 620 basis points. store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues increased 750 basis points, primarily due to sales deleverage attributable to covid-19 impacts, which included catastrophe pay and enhanced pay programs for retail partners, net of benefits provided by temporary subsidies from the u.s. and certain foreign governments (approximately 150 basis points).
other operating expenses increased $59 million, primarily due to incremental costs to develop and grow the global coffee alliance.
depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 90 basis points, primarily due to sales deleverage.
general and administrative expenses decreased $145 million, primarily driven by lower performance-based compensation ($63 million), lapping of the 2018 u.s stock award granted in fiscal 2018, which was funded by savings from the tax cuts and jobs act enacted in december 2017 ("tax act") and vested in fiscal 2019 ($61 million), and lapping of the 2019 starbucks leadership experience in chicago ($52 million), partially offset by incremental strategic investments in technology.
restructuring and impairment expenses increased $143 million, primarily due to higher asset impairment related to our north america store portfolio optimization ($136 million), higher lease-related costs associated with the closure of certain company-operated stores ($28 million) and intangible asset impairment related to changes in our branding and marketing strategies ($22 million). partially offsetting theses increases were lower severance costs ($38 million) and lapping the impairment related to our switzerland retail market ($10 million).
income from equity investees increased $25 million, primarily due to higher income from our north american coffee partnership joint venture and growth in our south korea joint venture.
the combination of these changes resulted in an overall decrease in operating margin of 880 basis points in fiscal 2020 when compared to fiscal 2019.

net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations decreased $623 million due to lapping the sale of retail operations in thailand, france and the netherlands in fiscal 2019.
interest income and other, net decreased $57 million, primarily due to lower interest rates and lapping the gain on the sale of a non-operating asset.
interest expense increased $106 million primarily due to additional interest incurred on long-term debt issued in march 2020 and may 2020.
the effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was 20.6% compared to 19.5% for fiscal 2019. the increase was primarily due to the valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets of certain international jurisdictions (approximately 980 basis points). this unfavorable impact was partially offset by lower pre-tax earnings including the foreign rate differential on our jurisdictional mix of earnings (approximately 340 basis points), stock-based compensation excess tax benefits in relation to pre-tax earnings (approximately 250 basis points), remeasurement of deferred tax assets due to enacted corporate rate change (approximately 220 basis points) and the impact of changes in indefinite reinvestment assertions for certain foreign subsidiaries in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 (approximately 170 basis points). see note 14, income taxes, for further discussion.

revenues americas total net revenues for fiscal 2020 decreased $1.9 billion, or 10%, primarily due to a 12% decrease in comparable store sales ($1.9 billion) driven by a 21% decrease in transactions, partially offset by an 11% increase in average ticket. also contributing were lower product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($354 million). these decreases were partially offset by 134 net new starbucks® company-operated stores, or a 1% increase, over the past 12 months ($436 million).
operating margin americas operating income for fiscal 2020 decreased 52% to $1.8 billion, compared to $3.8 billion in fiscal 2019. operating margin decreased 960 basis points to 11.1%, primarily due to sales deleverage attributed to reduced labor productivity and additional costs incurred as a result of covid-19, mainly catastrophe pay and enhanced pay programs for retail store partners incurred primarily during the fiscal third quarter, net of benefits provided by the cares act and cews (approximately 180 basis points). higher restructuring expenses relating to our north america portfolio optimization (approximately 130 basis points) also contributed to the decrease. partially offsetting these decreases were sales leverage realized prior to the onset of covid-19 and pricing increases.

revenues international total net revenues for fiscal 2020 decreased $1.0 billion, or 17%, primarily due to a 19% decrease in comparable store sales ($931 million) driven by a 23% decrease in transactions, partially offset by a 5% increase in average ticket. also contributing were lower product sales and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from licensees ($199 million) and the conversions of our retail businesses in thailand, france and the netherlands to fully licensed markets during fiscal 2019 ($186 million). these decreases were partially offset by 672 net new starbucks® company-operated stores, or an 11% increase, over the past 12 months ($282 million).
operating margin international operating income for fiscal 2020 decreased 63% to $354 million, compared to $965 million in fiscal 2019. operating margin decreased 870 basis points to 6.9%, primarily driven by sales deleverage concentrated in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2020 attributable to covid-19, including continued partner wages and benefits as well as occupancy costs. royalty relief granted to licensees during the third fiscal quarter also contributed to the decline (approximately 80 basis points).

revenues channel development total net revenues for fiscal 2020 decreased $68 million, or 3% compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to the lapping of higher transition activities related to the global coffee alliance ($115 million) and product sales to unilever as a result of the sale and transition of the tazo brand ($34 million). these were partially offset by the expansion of the global coffee alliance ($70 million), as at-home coffee consumption grew while the foodservice business experienced softening due to covid-19.
operating margin channel development operating income for fiscal 2020 decreased 1% to $687 million, compared to $698 million in fiscal 2019. operating margin increased 70 basis points to 35.7%, primarily due to the transfer of certain single-serve products to nestlé as part of the global coffee alliance (approximately 150 basis points), strong performance from our north american coffee partnership joint venture (approximately 80 basis points) and lapping the correction of amortization expense (approximately 60 basis points) in the prior year, partially offset by certain transition items related to the global coffee alliance (approximately 190 basis points).

corporate and other operating loss decreased to $1.3 billion for fiscal 2020, or 5%, compared to $1.4 billion in fiscal 2019. this decrease was primarily driven by lower performance-based compensation and lapping of the 2018 u.s stock award granted in fiscal 2018, which was funded by savings from the tax act and vested in fiscal 2019, partially offset by incremental strategic investments in technology.

total net revenues increased $1.8 billion, or 7%, over fiscal 2018, primarily driven by higher revenues from company-operated stores ($1.9 billion). the growth in company-operated store revenues was driven by incremental revenues from 947 net new starbucks® company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($957 million) and a 5% increase in comparable store sales ($879 million), attributable to a 3% increase in average ticket and a 2% increase in comparable transactions. these increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation ($189 million) and the conversion of our thailand, france and the netherlands retail businesses to fully licensed markets during fiscal 2019 ($161 million).
licensed store revenue growth also contributed to the increase in total net revenues ($223 million), primarily due to higher product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($228 million), largely due to the opening of 992 net new starbucks® licensed stores over the past 12 months, and the conversion of our thailand, france and the netherlands retail businesses to fully licensed markets ($35 million), partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation ($41 million).
other revenues decreased $288 million, primarily driven by the licensing of our cpg and foodservice businesses to nestlé. partially offsetting this decrease was growth in product revenue, primarily premium single-serve products, in connection with the global coffee alliance.

product and distribution costs as a percentage of total net revenues increased 10 basis points, primarily due to licensing our cpg and foodservice businesses to nestlé (approximately 80 basis points), partially offset by cost savings initiatives (approximately 70 basis points) and leverage on product and distribution costs, largely driven by price increases.
store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 130 basis points. store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues increased 60 basis points, primarily driven by investments in our store partners that are funded by savings from the tax act and growth in wages and benefits (approximately 120 basis points), largely in the americas segment, partially offset by sales leverage driven by price increases and the impact of the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance on stored value card breakage.
other operating expenses decreased $184 million, primarily due to cost savings related to licensing our cpg and foodservice businesses to nestlé ($176 million) and lapping prior year costs associated with the establishment of the global coffee alliance ($34 million), including business taxes associated with the up-front prepaid royalty from nestlé and headcount-related costs, primarily relating to employee bonus and retention costs.
depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 20 basis points, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in east china (approximately 20 basis points).
general and administrative expenses increased $116 million, primarily driven by higher performance-based compensation ($89 million) and the 2019 starbucks leadership experience in chicago, heavily concentrated in our fiscal fourth quarter ($52 million).
restructuring and impairment expenses decreased $89 million, primarily due to lower restructuring and impairment costs related to teavanatm/mc retail store closures ($128 million) and lower impairments related to our switzerland retail market ($27 million), partially offset by higher exit costs associated with the closure of certain starbucks® company-operated stores ($32 million) and severance costs ($25 million).
income from equity investees decreased $3 million, primarily due to the impact of our ownership changes in east china. this decrease was partially offset by improved comparable store sales from our joint venture in south korea and higher income from our north american coffee partnership joint venture.
the combination of these changes resulted in an overall decrease in operating margin of 30 basis points in fiscal 2019 when compared to fiscal 2018.

gain resulting from acquisition of joint venture in fiscal 2018 was due to remeasuring our preexisting 50% ownership interest in our east china joint venture to fair value upon acquisition.
net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations was primarily due to the sale of our thailand, france and the netherlands retail operations in fiscal 2019. the gain in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the sale of our tazo brand and taiwan joint venture, partially offset by the net loss from the sale of our brazil retail operations in fiscal 2018.
interest income and other, net decreased $95 million, primarily due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance on a prospective basis, which required estimated breakage on unredeemed store value cards to be recorded as revenue. we recorded stored value card breakage in interest income and other, net in the prior year.
interest expense increased $161 million primarily due to additional interest incurred on long-term debt issued in november 2017, march 2018, august 2018 and may 2019.
the effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 19.5% compared to 21.8% for fiscal 2018. the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the lower corporate tax rate as a result of the tax act (approximately 350 basis points), lapping prior year's transition tax on our accumulated undistributed foreign earnings and remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities (approximately 300 basis points), higher stock-based compensation excess tax benefit (approximately 140 basis points), the release of income tax reserves related to the settlement of a u.s. tax examination and the expiration of statute of limitations (approximately 130 basis points) and the tax impacts of the gain on the sale of our thailand retail operations (approximately 130 basis points). these favorable impacts were partially offset by the lapping of prior year's gain on the purchase of our east china joint venture that was not subject to income tax (approximately 580 basis points) and the impact of changes in indefinite reinvestment assertions for certain foreign subsidiaries during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 (approximately 170 basis points). see note 14, income taxes, for further discussion.

revenues americas total net revenues for fiscal 2019 increased $1.5 billion, or 9%, primarily driven by a 5% increase in comparable store sales ($744 million) and 282 net new starbucks® company-operated stores, or a 3% increase, over the past 12 months ($580 million). also contributing were higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($144 million), primarily resulting from comparable store sales growth and the opening of 323 net new starbucks® licensed stores, or 4% increase, over the past 12 months and the impact of the adoption of revenue recognition guidance on stored value card breakage ($119 million).
operating margin americas operating income for fiscal 2019 increased 9% to $3.8 billion, compared to $3.5 billion in fiscal 2018. operating margin decreased 10 basis points to 20.7%, primarily driven by higher partner investments, largely funded by savings from the tax act, growth in wages and benefits (approximately 130 basis points) and to a much lesser extent, investments in labor hours heavily concentrated in our fiscal fourth quarter. partially offsetting these were cost savings initiatives, primarily in product and distribution costs (approximately 90 basis points), the impact of the adoption of revenue recognition guidance on stored value card breakage (approximately 50 basis points) and sales leverage.

discussion of our international segment results below reflects the impact of fully consolidating our east china business from an equity method joint venture to a company-operated market since the acquisition date of december 31, 2017. under the joint venture model, we recognized royalties and product sales within revenue and related product and distribution costs as well as our proportionate share of east china's net earnings, which resulted in a higher margin business. under the company-operated ownership model, east china's operating results are reflected in most income statement lines of this segment.
revenues international total net revenues for fiscal 2019 increased $640 million, or 12%%, primarily driven by 665 net new starbucks® company-operated stores, or a 12% increase, over the past 12 months ($377 million), the ownership change in east china ($280 million) and a 3% increase in comparable store sales ($135 million). also contributing were increased product sales to and royalty revenues from licensees ($84 million), primarily resulting from opening of 669 net new starbucks® licensed stores, or an 11% increase, over the past 12 months and the impact of the adoption of revenue recognition guidance on stored value card breakage ($20 million). these increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation ($183 million) and the conversion of our thailand, france and the netherlands retail businesses to fully licensed markets ($126 million).
operating margin international operating income for fiscal 2019 increased 11% to $965 million, compared to $873 million in fiscal 2018. operating margin decreased 10 basis points to 15.6%, primarily driven by strategic investments to support growth in china (approximately 80 basis points) and growth in wages and benefits (approximately 70 basis points), primarily offset by cost savings initiatives (approximately 80 basis points) and labor efficiencies (approximately 70 basis points).

our channel development segment results reflect the impact of the licensing of our cpg and foodservice businesses to nestlé late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, which we lapped late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. our collaborative business relationships for our global ready-to-drink products and the associated revenues remain unchanged due to the global coffee alliance.
revenues channel development net revenues for fiscal 2019 decreased $305 million, or 13%, when compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by licensing our cpg and foodservice businesses to nestlé ($329 million), offset by growth in product revenue, primarily premium single-serve products, in connection with our global coffee alliance ($25 million).
operating margin channel development operating income for fiscal 2019 decreased 25% to $698 million, compared to $927 million in fiscal 2018. operating margin decreased 540 basis points to 35.0%, primarily driven by licensing our cpg and foodservice businesses to nestlé (approximately 640 basis points), partially offset by lapping prior year costs associated with the establishment of the global coffee alliance (approximately 140 basis points), including business taxes associated with the up-front prepaid royalty and headcount-related costs, primarily related to employee bonus and retention costs.

corporate and other primarily consists of our unallocated corporate expenses, as well as evolution fresh and the legacy operations of the teavana retail business, which substantially ceased during fiscal 2018. unallocated corporate expenses include corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments.
financial condition, liquidity and capital resources cash and investment overview our cash and investments were $4.8 billion and $3.0 billion as of september 27, 2020 and september 29, 2019, respectively. in fiscal 2020, cash and investments increased by $1.8 billion primarily due to the issuance of short-term and long-term debt as well as lower share repurchases following the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program in march 2020. these liquidity increases offset lower retail cash inflows due to temporary store closures and modified operations resulting from the covid-19 pandemic. we actively manage our cash and investments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, make acquisitions and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases. our investment portfolio primarily includes highly liquid available-for-sale securities, including corporate debt securities, government treasury securities (domestic and foreign) and commercial paper. as of september 27, 2020, approximately $2.0 billion of cash was held in foreign subsidiaries.
borrowing capacity credit facilities and commercial paper our total contractual borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes was $2.7 billion as of the end of fiscal 2020 when combining the unused commercial paper program and credit facilities discussed below, less outstanding borrowing.
revolving lines of credit our $2.0 billion unsecured 5-year revolving credit facility ("the 2018 credit facility"), of which $150 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is currently set to mature on october 25, 2022. we have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $500 million. borrowings under the credit facility are subject to terms defined within the 2018 credit facility and will bear interest at a variable rate based on libor, and, for u.s. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a base rate, in each case plus an applicable margin. the applicable margin is based on the better of (i) the company's long-term credit ratings assigned by moody's and standard & poor's rating agencies and (ii) the company's fixed charge coverage ratio, pursuant to a pricing grid set forth in the five-year credit agreement. the current applicable margin is 1.100% for eurocurrency rate loans and 0.000% (nil) for base rate loans. the 2018 credit facility is available for general corporate purposes. as of september 27, 2020, we had no borrowings under the 2018 credit facility.
our $1.0 billion unsecured 364-day credit facility (the "364-day credit facility"), of which no amount may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is currently set to mature on september 22, 2021. we have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $500 million. borrowings under the credit facility are subject to terms defined within the 364-day credit facility and will bear interest at a variable rate based on libor, and, for u.s. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a base rate, in each case plus an applicable margin. the applicable margin is based on the better of (i) the company's long-term credit ratings assigned by moody's and standard & poor's rating agencies and (ii) the company's fixed charge coverage ratio, pursuant to a pricing grid set forth in the 364-day credit agreement. the applicable margin is 1.150% for eurocurrency rate loans and 0.150% for base rate loans. the 364-day credit facility is available for general corporate purposes. as of september 27, 2020, we had no borrowings under the 364-day credit facility.
due to the financial impacts from covid-19, we reached an agreement with our lenders to amend the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant for our combined $3.0 billion revolving lines of credit, through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.
commercial paper under our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion, with individual maturities that may vary but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are required to be backstopped by available commitments under the 2018 and 364-day credit facilities discussed above. the proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program may be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, business expansion, payment of cash dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. as of september 27, 2020, we had borrowings of $296.5 million outstanding, net of unamortized discount, under our commercial paper program, of which a majority will mature during the second quarter of fiscal 2021.
credit facilities in japan additionally, we hold japanese yen-denominated credit facilities which are available for working capital needs and capital expenditures within our japanese market.
during the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we expanded our ¥1 billion unsecured credit facility to ¥5 billion, or $47.4 million, as of september 27, 2020. this facility is currently set to mature on december 31, 2020. borrowings under the credit facility are subject to terms defined within the facility and will bear interest at a variable rate based on tibor plus an applicable margin of 0.400%. additionally during the third quarter, we expanded our ¥2 billion unsecured credit facility to ¥10 billion, or $94.9 million, as of september 27, 2020. this facility is currently set to mature on march 26, 2021. borrowings under the credit facility are subject to terms defined within the facility and will bear interest at a variable rate based on tibor plus 0.300%. as of september 27, 2020, we had $142.3 million of borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities.
in october 2020, we entered into a new ¥10 billion unsecured facility, or approximately $95 million as of october 29, 2020. this facility is set to mature on october 29, 2021. borrowings under the credit facility are subject to terms defined within the facility and will bear interest at a variable rate based on tibor plus an applicable margin of 0.350%.
long-term debt on may 7, 2020, we issued long-term debt in an underwritten registered public offering, which consisted of $500 million of 1.300% senior notes (the"2022 notes") due may 2022, $1.25 billion of 2.550% senior notes (the "2030 notes") due november 2030 and $1.25 billion of 3.500% senior notes (the "2050 notes") due november 2050. we are using the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes and for future repayments of outstanding indebtedness. interest on the 2022 notes is payable semi-annually on may 7 and november 7, commencing on november 7, 2020. interest on the 2030 notes and the 2050 notes is payable semi-annually on may 15 and november 15, commencing on november 15, 2020.
on march 12, 2020, we issued long-term debt in an underwritten registered public offering, which consisted of $500 million of 2.000% senior notes (the "2027 notes") due march 2027, $750 million of 2.250% senior notes (the "2030 notes") due march 2030 and $500 million of 3.350% senior notes (the "2050 notes") due march 2050. we are using the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program. we may temporarily invest funds that are not immediately needed for these purposes in short-term investments, including marketable securities. interest on the 2027 notes, the 2030 notes and the 2050 notes is payable semi-annually on march 12 and september 12, commencing on september 12, 2020.
see note 9, debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k for details of the components of our long-term debt.
our ability to incur new liens and conduct sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties is subject to compliance with terms of the indentures under which the senior notes were issued. as of september 27, 2020, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants.
use of cash we expect to use our available cash and investments, including, but not limited to, additional potential future borrowings under the credit facilities, commercial paper program and the issuance of debt to support and invest in our core businesses, including investing in new ways to serve our customers and supporting our store partners, repaying maturing debts, as well as returning cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and discretionary share repurchases and investing in new business opportunities related to our core and developing businesses. further, we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our investees. we may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business in support of our "growth at scale" agenda. acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our investees. any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy.
we believe that net future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and investments both domestically and internationally combined with our ability to leverage our balance sheet through the issuance of debt will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses as well as shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future. significant new joint ventures, acquisitions and/or other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding. we have borrowed funds and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates; however, additional borrowings would result in increased interest expense in the future. in this regard, we may incur additional debt, within targeted levels, as part of our plans to fund our capital programs, including cash returns to shareholders through future dividends and discretionary share repurchases. to further strengthen our liquidity in the near term, we currently expect the suspension of share repurchases to continue through the end of fiscal 2021. if necessary, we may pursue additional sources of financing, including both short-term and long-term borrowings and debt issuances.
we regularly review our cash positions and our determination of indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings. in the event we determine that all or a portion of such foreign earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and u.s. state income taxes, which could be material. we do not anticipate the need for repatriated funds to the u.s. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs. see note 14, income taxes, for further discussion.
during fiscal 2020, we entered into a new $500 million unsecured 364-day term-loan facility ("the 2020 term-loan facility") which we drew on and subsequently repaid within the fiscal year. the 2020 term-loan facility was originally set to mature on march 19, 2021.
during each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2019, we declared a cash dividend to shareholders of $0.36 per share. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2020, we declared a cash dividend of $0.41 per share. dividends are paid in the quarter following the declaration date. cash returned to shareholders through dividends in fiscal 2020 and 2019 totaled $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. subsequent to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we declared a cash dividend of $0.45 per share to be paid on november 27, 2020 with an expected payout of approximately $527.9 million. as of the date of this report, we do not expect to reduce our quarterly dividend as a result of the covid-19 pandemic.
in september 2018, we entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements ("asr agreements") with third-party financial institutions totaling $5.0 billion, effective october 1, 2018. we made a $5.0 billion up-front payment to the financial institutions and received an initial delivery of 72.0 million shares of our common stock. in march 2019, we received an additional 4.9 million shares upon the completion of the program based on a volume-weighted average share price (less discount) of $65.03.
additionally, in march 2019, we entered into asr agreements with third-party financial institutions totaling $2.0 billion, effective march 22, 2019. we made a $2.0 billion up-front payment to the financial institutions and received an initial delivery of 22.2 million shares of our common stock. in june 2019, we received an additional 3.9 million shares upon the completion of the program based on a volume-weighted average share price (less discount) of $76.50.
outside of the asr agreements noted above, we repurchased 36.6 million shares of common stock for $3.1 billion on the open market during the fiscal year ended september 29, 2019. in total, we repurchased 139.6 million shares at a total cost of $10.1 billion for the fiscal year ended september 29, 2019.
our board of directors approved an increase of 120 million and 40 million shares to our ongoing share repurchase program during the fiscal first quarter of 2019 and fiscal second quarter of 2020, respectively. we temporarily suspended our share repurchase program in march 2020. prior to the suspension, we repurchased 20.3 million shares of common stock for $1.7 billion on the open market during the year ended september 27, 2020. as of september 27, 2020, 48.9 million shares remained available for repurchase under current authorizations. the existing share repurchase program remains authorized by the board of directors. the suspension of the share repurchases is currently expected to continue through fiscal 2021, and we may resume share repurchases in the future at any time, depending upon operating results, our capital needs and other factors.
other than normal operating expenses, cash requirements for fiscal 2021 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for investments in our new and existing stores and our supply chain and corporate facilities. total capital expenditures for fiscal 2021 are expected to be approximately $1.9 billion.
cash flows cash provided by operating activities was $1.6 billion for fiscal 2020, compared to $5.0 billion for fiscal 2019. the change was primarily due to temporary retail store closures resulting from the covid-19 pandemic, the u.s. federal tax payment related to the nestlé transaction and the timing of other tax payments and refunds.
cash used in investing activities totaled $1.7 billion for fiscal 2020, compared to $1.0 billion for fiscal 2019. the change was primarily driven by lapping proceeds from the divestiture of certain operations related to the conversions of our retail businesses in thailand, france and the netherlands to fully licensed markets during 2019 and an increase in purchase of investments in fiscal 2020. this was partially offset by lower capital expenditures for new and existing stores.
cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2020 totaled $1.7 billion, compared to cash used in financing activities of $10.1 billion for fiscal 2019. the change was primarily due to higher repurchases of our common stock under accelerated share repurchase agreements in fiscal 2019 and higher proceeds from issuance of long-term debt in fiscal 2020.
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and borrowings as of september 27, 2020, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods (in millions):

(1)we have excluded long-term gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties of $137.5 million from the amounts presented as the timing of these obligations is uncertain.
(2)amounts include direct lease obligations, excluding any taxes, insurance and other related expenses.
(3)purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on starbucks and that specify all significant terms. green coffee purchase commitments comprise 93% of total purchase obligations.
(4)other obligations include other long-term liabilities primarily consisting of the tax act transition tax, asset retirement obligations, valor siren ventures i l.p. (vsv) investment and hedging instruments.
starbucks currently expects to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business.
off-balance sheet arrangements off-balance sheet arrangements relate to purchase commitments detailed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k.
commodity prices, availability and general risk conditions commodity price risk represents starbucks primary market risk, generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products, among other items. we purchase, roast and sell high-quality arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. in addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company-operated stores. the price and availability of these commodities directly impacts our results of operations, and we expect commodity prices, particularly coffee, to impact future results of operations. for additional details see product supply in item 1, as well as risk factors in item 1a of this 10-k.
financial risk management market risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices and interest rates. we manage our exposure to various market-based risks according to a market price risk management policy. under this policy, market-based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. the market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate risk. risk limits are set annually and prohibit speculative trading activity. we also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk, which we consider to be low. we use interest rate swap agreements and treasury locks to primarily hedge against changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances and cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange debt instruments to hedge against changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt and foreign exchange exposure of net investments in japan. excluding interest rate hedging instruments, cross currency swaps and foreign currency debt, hedging instruments generally do not have maturities in excess of three years. refer to note 1, summary of significant accounting policies, and note 3, derivative financial instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k for further discussion of our hedging instruments.
the sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited, point-in-time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed. the actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses.
commodity price risk we purchase commodity inputs, primarily coffee, dairy products, diesel, cocoa, sugar and other commodities, that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results. we use a combination of pricing features embedded within supply contracts, such as fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts for coffee purchases, and financial derivatives to manage our commodity price risk exposure.
the following table summarizes the potential impact as of september 27, 2020 to starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income ("oci") from changes in commodity prices. the information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items (in millions):

foreign currency exchange risk the majority of our revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in u.s. dollars. however, because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the u.s., we have transactions in other currencies, primarily the chinese renminbi, japanese yen, canadian dollar, british pound, south korean won and euro. to reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations, we enter into derivative instruments to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated intercompany royalty payments, inventory purchases, intercompany borrowing and lending activities and certain other transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity that enters into the arrangements, as well as the translation risk of certain balance sheet items. the volatility in the foreign exchange market may lead to significant fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates and adversely impact our financial results in the case of weakening foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar. see note 3, derivative financial instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k for further discussion.
the following table summarizes the potential impact as of september 27, 2020 to starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due to a change in the value of the u.s. dollar as compared to foreign exchange rates. the information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items (in millions):

equity security price risk we have minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds and equity exchange-traded funds within our marketable equity securities portfolio. marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value and approximates a portion of our liability under our management deferred compensation plan ("mdcp"). gains and losses from the portfolio and the change in our mdcp liability are recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings.
we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of september 27, 2020 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.
interest rate risk long-term debt we utilize short-term and long-term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage our overall interest expense related to our existing fixed-rate debt, as well as to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances. see note 3, derivative financial instruments and note 9, debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k for further discussion of our interest rate hedge agreements and details of the components of our long-term debt, respectively, as of september 27, 2020.
the following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates as of september 27, 2020 on the fair value of starbucks debt (in millions):

(1)amount disclosed is net of $23 million change in the fair value of our designated interest rate swap. refer to note 3, derivative financial instruments, for additional information on our interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge.
available-for-sale debt securities our available-for-sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of investment-grade debt securities. the primary objective of these investments is to preserve capital and liquidity. available-for-sale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. we do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our investments. we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our available-for-sale securities as of september 27, 2020 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.
application of critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, especially in light of the current economic environment due to the covid-19 pandemic. judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1, summary of significant accounting policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k. we believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity.
we consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. during the past five fiscal years, we have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies used to assess the areas discussed below, unless noted otherwise.
property, plant and equipment and other finite-lived assets we evaluate property, plant and equipment, operating lease right-of-use ("rou") assets and other finite-lived assets for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. when evaluating for impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated future undiscounted cash flows. if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset's carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis and is depreciated over the asset's remaining useful life.
long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. for company-operated store assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level, which is inclusive of property, plant and equipment and lease rou assets. the fair value of a store's assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. for other long-lived assets, fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances, which may include discounted cash flows, comparable transactions, or comparable company analyses.
our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values. key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values include projected revenue growth and operating expenses, as well as forecasting asset useful lives and selecting an appropriate discount rate. for company-operated stores, estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider the store's historical performance, the local market economics and the business environment impacting the store's performance. the discount rate is selected based on what we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store. these estimates are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets, changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance.
in each of the three fiscal years prior to fiscal 2020, our business has operated at levels of growth and profitability that have not required material numbers of our store assets to be reviewed for potential impairment. given the substantial reduction in our revenues and cash flows as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, primarily in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, along with our announced restructuring plans to close up to 800 of our company-operated stores in the u.s. and canada in the next 18 months, we identified triggering events that required us to assess the need for potential impairment charges for a larger number of company-operated stores in fiscal 2020 than in prior years. as a result of these activities, we recorded store impairment charges of $298.9 million in fiscal 2020, of which $239.3 million was included in restructuring and impairment expenses on our consolidated statement of earnings. the magnitude of these charges was not particularly sensitive to variations in fair value inputs, as the majority of charges recorded were the result of full impairments of stores identified for closure, based on factors such as the format and location of the store or its current operating performance. excluding stores in areas impacted by our restructuring plans, our company-operated store portfolio is projecting a return to pre-covid-19 levels of operations and cash flow recoverability within the next 12 months. however, irrespective of the above, our expectations of business recovery trends may vary materially in future periods based on the pace of global and market-specific recovery from the covid-19 pandemic.
as of september 27, 2020, we had identified 405 stores in the u.s. and canada for closure under our restructuring plans. we expect to potentially identify up to another 395 stores for closure. we expect total future restructuring costs, which are attributable to our americas segment, to range from approximately $260 million to $400 million. these restructuring costs include accelerated amortization or impairments of rou assets due to planned store closures prior to the end of contractual lease terms ($150 million to $190 million), store asset impairment and disposal costs not previously recorded as part of our ongoing store impairment process ($100 million to $190 million) and the remaining amount relates to employee termination costs. our estimates of future restructuring costs are based on actual costs incurred for recently closed stores of similar profile under the restructuring plans. as we have previously recorded impairment charges in fiscal 2020 for stores that may be identified for closure under our plans, and because store closure decisions are still subject to change, the final costs associated with these store closures may be different from the initial estimates. these costs will depend on the asset carrying value and remaining lease term for each store identified. future restructuring costs are expected to be incurred over the next 18 months as stores are specifically identified for closure or, in the case of lease exit costs, when the stores cease operations.
asset impairment charges are discussed in note 1, summary of significant accounting policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets we evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate impairment may exist. when evaluating these assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. if we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using discounted cash flows or a combination of discounted cash flow and market approaches.
when assessing goodwill for impairment, our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit in a given year is influenced by a number of factors, inclusive of the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill, the significance of the excess of the reporting unit's estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date, the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments and the date of acquisition. if we perform a quantitative assessment of an individual reporting unit's goodwill, our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment when estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, including projected revenue growth and operating expenses related to existing businesses, product innovation and new store concepts, as well as utilizing valuation multiples of similar publicly traded companies and selecting an appropriate discount rate. estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering the reporting unit's past performance and forecasted growth, including assumptions regarding business recovery post covid-19, strategic initiatives, local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit's performance. the discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital for a market participant to operate the reporting unit in the region. these estimates, as well as the selection of comparable companies and valuation multiples used in the market approaches are highly subjective, and our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion. our goodwill impairment assessments were not significantly altered as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. we continue to believe the fair value of each of our reporting units is significantly in excess of its carrying value, and absent a sustained multi-year global decline in our business in key markets such as the u.s. and china, we do not anticipate incurring significant goodwill impairment in the next 12 months.
when assessing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, where we perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate if changes in events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that impairment may exist. if we do not perform a qualitative impairment assessment or if changes in events and circumstances indicate that a quantitative assessment should be performed, management is required to calculate the fair value of the intangible asset group. the fair value calculation includes estimates of revenue growth, which are based on past performance and internal projections for the intangible asset group's forecasted growth, including assumptions regarding business recovery post covid-19, and royalty rates, which are adjusted for our particular facts and circumstances. the discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business. these estimates are highly subjective, and our ability to achieve the forecasted cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion. during fiscal 2020, we recorded a charge of $22.1 million relating to the impairment of an indefinite-lived intangible asset due to changes in branding and marketing strategy. the amount of charge taken was not materially impacted by our choice of fair value assumptions, and we do not anticipate recording significant impairment charges in the next 12 months.
definite-lived intangible asset impairment charges are discussed in note 8, other intangible assets and goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k.
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. we routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized.
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of operations. in projecting future taxable income, we consider historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. our assumptions regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our underlying businesses. in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income/(loss). during fiscal 2020, we recorded valuation allowances of $56.5 million to reduce our deferred tax asset balance as of the beginning of the fiscal year relating to certain foreign jurisdictions not expected to generate enough future income to offset accumulated losses. absent a sustained multi-year global decline in our business in key markets such as the u.s., china and japan, we do not anticipate incurring significant additional valuation allowances against our remaining deferred tax assets as of september 27, 2020 in the next 12 months.
in addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. these audits include review of our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions. we evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of our position. for uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. we adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available. as discussed in note 14, income taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k, there is a reasonable possibility that our unrecognized tax benefit liability will be adjusted within 12 months due to the expiration of a statute of limitations and/or resolution of examinations with taxing authorities.
we have generated income in certain foreign jurisdictions that may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and u.s. state income taxes. we regularly review our plans for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings. these plans have been unaltered as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. while we do not expect to repatriate cash to the u.s. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs, if these amounts were distributed to the u.s., in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and u.s. state income taxes, which could be material.
our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances. although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results, including forecasted covid-19 business recovery, could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected.
recent accounting pronouncements see note 1, summary of significant accounting policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements.

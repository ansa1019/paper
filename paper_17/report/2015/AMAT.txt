item 1a:   risk factors the following factors could materially and adversely affect applied's business, financial condition or results of operations and cause reputational harm, and they should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business, in addition to other information presented elsewhere in this report.
the industries that applied serves are volatile and difficult to predict.
as a supplier to the global semiconductor, display, and solar industries, applied is subject to business cycles, the timing, length and volatility of which can be difficult to predict and which vary by reportable segment. these industries historically have been cyclical due to sudden changes in customers' requirements for new manufacturing capacity and advanced technology, which depend in part on customers' capacity utilization, production volumes, access to affordable capital, end-use demand, consumer buying patterns, and inventory levels relative to demand, as well as the rate of technology transitions and general economic conditions. these changes have affected the timing and amounts of customers' purchases and investments in technology, and continue to affect applied's orders, net sales, operating expenses and net income. in particular, the amount and mix of capital equipment spending between foundry, memory and logic customers can have a significant impact on the results of operations of our silicon systems segment, which is the largest contributor to applied's consolidated net sales and total new orders.
to meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves, applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity for each of its segments as well as across multiple segments, and may incur unexpected or additional costs to align its business operations. during periods of increasing demand for its products, applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand; effectively manage its supply chain; attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees; and continue to control costs. during periods of decreasing demand, applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions; effectively manage its supply chain; and motivate and retain key employees. if applied does not effectively manage its costs during periods of decreasing demand, its gross margins and earnings may be adversely impacted.
applied is exposed to risks associated with the uncertain global economy.
uncertain global economic conditions along with uncertainties in the financial markets, national debt and fiscal concerns in various regions, and government austerity measures, are posing challenges to the industries in which applied operates. the markets for semiconductors and displays in particular depend largely on consumer spending. economic uncertainty and related factors exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause certain applied customers to push out, cancel, or refrain from placing orders for equipment or services, which may in turn reduce applied's net sales, reduce backlog, and affect applied's ability to convert backlog to sales. uncertain market conditions, difficulties in obtaining capital, or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, which can also result in lower sales and/or additional inventory or bad debt expense for applied. these conditions may similarly affect key suppliers, which could impair their ability to deliver parts and result in delays for applied's products or added costs. in addition, these conditions may lead to strategic alliances by, or consolidation of, other equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect applied's ability to compete effectively.
uncertainty about future economic and industry conditions also makes it more challenging for applied to forecast its operating results, make business decisions, and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its businesses, sources and uses of cash, financial condition and results of operations. applied may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts, including restructuring activities, which may adversely affect applied's ability to capitalize on opportunities. in addition, applied maintains an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit, liquidity, foreign exchange, market and interest rate risks. the risks to applied's investment portfolio may be exacerbated if financial market conditions deteriorate and, as a result, the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio, as well as returns on pension assets, could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges. applied also maintains cash balances in various bank accounts globally in order to fund normal operations. if any of these financial institutions becomes insolvent, it could limit applied's ability to access cash in the affected accounts.
14
applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the various industries in which it operates.
the global semiconductor, display, solar and related industries in which applied operates are characterized by ongoing changes affecting some or all of these industries that impact demand for and/or the profitability of applied's products, including:
•   the nature, timing and degree of visibility of changes in end demand for electronic products, including those related to fluctuations in consumer buying patterns tied to seasonality or the introduction of new products, and the effects of these changes on foundry and other customers' businesses and, in turn, on demand for applied's products;
•   increasing capital requirements for building and operating new fabrication plants and customers' ability to raise the necessary capital;
•   differences in growth rates among the semiconductor, display and solar industries;
•   the increasing importance of establishing, improving and maintaining strong relationships with customers;
•   the increasing cost and complexity for customers to move from product design to volume manufacturing, which may slow the adoption rate of new manufacturing technology;
•   the need to continually reduce the total cost of manufacturing system ownership;
•   the heightened importance to customers of system reliability and productivity and the effect on demand for fabrication systems as a result of their increasing productivity, device yield and reliability;
•   manufacturers' ability to reconfigure and re-use fabrication systems;
•   the increasing importance of, and difficulties in, developing products with sufficient differentiation to influence customers' purchasing decisions;
•   requirements for shorter cycle times for the development, manufacture and installation of manufacturing equipment;

•   the increasing role for and complexity of software in applied products; and
•   the increasing focus on reducing energy usage and improving the environmental impact and sustainability associated with manufacturing operations.
applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the semiconductor industry.
the largest proportion of applied's consolidated net sales and profitability has been and continues to be derived from sales of manufacturing equipment in the silicon systems segment to the global semiconductor industry. in addition, a majority of the revenues of applied global services is from sales of service products to semiconductor manufacturers. the semiconductor industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and/or the profitability of applied's semiconductor equipment and service products, including:
•   the increasing cost of research and development due to many factors, including: decreasing linewidths on a chip, the use of new materials, new and more complex device structures, more applications and process steps, increasing chip design costs, and the increasing cost and complexity of integrated manufacturing processes;
•   the need to reduce product development time, despite the increasing difficulty of technical challenges;
•   the growing number of types and varieties of semiconductors and number of applications across multiple substrate sizes;
•   the increasing cost and complexity for semiconductor manufacturers to move more technically advanced capability and smaller linewidths to volume manufacturing, and the resulting impact on the rates of technology transition and investment in capital equipment;
•   challenges in generating organic growth given semiconductor manufacturers' levels of capital expenditures and the allocation of capital investment to market segments that applied does not serve, such as lithography, or segments where applied's products have lower relative market presence;
•   the importance of increasing market positions in under-penetrated segments, such as etch and inspection;
•   semiconductor manufacturer's ability to reconfigure and re-use equipment, and the resulting effect on their need to purchase new equipment and services;
•   the increasing frequency and complexity of technology transitions and inflections, such as 3-d transistors and advanced interconnects, and applied's ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to these changes;
15
•   shorter cycle times between order placements by customers (particularly foundries) and product shipment, which may lead to inventory write-offs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease gross margin;
•   competitive factors that make it difficult to enhance position, including challenges in securing development-tool-of-record (dtor) and production-tool-of-record (ptor) positions with customers;
•   consolidation in the semiconductor industry, including among semiconductor manufacturers and among manufacturing equipment suppliers;
•   shifts in sourcing strategies by computer and electronics companies that impact the equipment requirements of applied's foundry customers;
•   the concentration of new wafer starts in korea and taiwan, where applied's service penetration and service-revenue-per-wafer-start have been lower than in other regions;
•   the potential increasing investment in semiconductor manufacturing capabilities in china, and its effect on the demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment; and
•   the increasing fragmentation of semiconductor markets, leading certain markets to become too small to support the cost of a new fabrication plant, while others require less technologically advanced products.
applied must accurately forecast, and allocate appropriate resources and investment towards addressing, key technology changes and inflections in order to enable opportunities for gains.
applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the display industry.
the global display industry historically has experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment investment levels, due in part to the limited number of display manufacturers, the concentrated nature of end-use applications, production capacity relative to end-use demand, and panel manufacturer profitability. industry growth has depended primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced tvs and, more recently, on demand for smartphones and other mobile devices, which demand is highly sensitive to cost and improvements in technologies and features. the display industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and/or the profitability of applied's display products, including:
•   the timing and extent of an expansion of manufacturing facilities in china, which may be affected by changes in economic conditions in china;
•   the rate of transition to larger substrate sizes for tvs and to new display technologies for tvs and mobile applications, and the resulting effect on capital intensity in the industry and on applied's product differentiation, gross margin and return on investment;
•   the importance of new types of display technologies, such as low temperature polysilicon (ltps), organic light-emitting diode (oled), flexible displays and metal oxide, and new touch panel films; and
•   uncertainty with respect to future display technology end-use applications and growth drivers.
16
applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the solar industry.
investment levels in capital equipment for the global solar industry have experienced considerable volatility. in recent years, global solar pv production capacity has exceeded end-use demand, causing customers to significantly reduce or delay investments in manufacturing capacity and new technology, or to cease operations. recently, applied implemented cost reduction measures in its solar business, and as a result incurred restructuring charges, asset impairments and inventory-related charges. the global solar market is characterized by ongoing changes specific to this industry that impact demand for and/or the profitability of applied's solar products, including:
•   the need to continually decrease the cost-per-watt of electricity produced by solar pv products to at or below grid parity in more global regions by, among other things, reducing operating costs and increasing throughputs for solar pv manufacturing, and improving the conversion efficiency of solar pvs;
•   the variability and uncertainty of government energy policies and their effect in influencing the rate of growth of the solar pv market, including the availability and amount of incentives for solar power such as tax credits, feed-in tariffs, rebates, renewable portfolio standards that require electricity providers to sell a targeted amount of energy from renewable sources, and goals for solar installations on government facilities;
•   the number of solar pv manufacturers and amount of global production capacity for solar pvs, primarily in china;
•   the assessment of duties on solar cells and modules imported from china, taiwan and other countries;
•   challenges associated with marketing and selling manufacturing equipment and services to a diverse and diffuse customer base;
•   the availability and condition of used solar equipment, which impacts demand for new equipment;
•   the financial condition of solar pv customers and their access to affordable financing and capital; and
•   solar panel manufacturing overcapacity, which has led to weak industry operating performance and outlooks, deterioration of the solar equipment market, and a worsening of the financial condition of certain customers.
applied must continually innovate, commercialize its products, and adapt its business and product offerings to respond to competition and rapid technological changes.
as applied operates in a highly competitive environment in which innovation is critical, its future success depends on many factors, including the effective commercialization and customer acceptance of its equipment, services and related products. in addition, applied must successfully execute its growth strategy, including enhancing its presence in existing markets, expanding into related markets, cultivating new markets and exceeding industry growth rates, while constantly improving its operational performance. the development, introduction and support of a broadening set of products in more collaborative, geographically diverse, open and varied competitive environments have grown more complex and expensive over time. furthermore, new or improved products may entail higher costs and reduced profits. applied's performance may be adversely affected if it does not timely, cost-effectively and successfully:
•   identify and address technology inflections, market changes, new applications, customer requirements and end-use demand;
•   develop new products and disruptive technologies, improve and/or develop new applications for existing products, and adapt similar products for use by customers in different applications and/or markets with varying technical requirements;
•   differentiate its products from those of competitors and any disruptive technologies, meet customers' performance specifications, appropriately price products, and achieve market acceptance;
•   maintain operating flexibility to enable different responses to different markets, customers and applications;
•   enhance its worldwide operations across all business segments to reduce cycle time, enable continuous quality improvement, reduce costs, and enhance design for manufacturability and serviceability;
•   focus on product development and sales and marketing strategies that address customers' high value problems and foster strong customer relationships;
17
•   allocate resources, including people and r&amp;d funding, among applied's products and between the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products, as most appropriate and effective for future growth;
•   reduce the cost and improve the productivity of capital invested in r&amp;d activities;
•   accurately forecast demand, work with suppliers and meet production schedules for its products;
•   improve its manufacturing processes and achieve cost efficiencies across product offerings;
•   adapt to changes in value offered by companies in different parts of the supply chain;
•   qualify products for evaluation and, in turn, volume manufacturing with its customers; and
•   implement changes in its design engineering methodology, including those that enable reduction of material costs and cycle time, greater commonality of platforms and types of parts used in different systems, greater effectiveness of product life cycle management, and reduced energy usage and environmental impact.
applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base.
applied's semiconductor customer base historically has been, and is becoming even more, highly concentrated as a result of economic and industry conditions. in fiscal 2015, two semiconductor manufacturers accounted for approximately 41 percent of the silicon systems segment's net sales and two customers accounted for 33 percent of applied's consolidated net sales. applied's display customer base is also highly concentrated. applied's customer base is also geographically-concentrated. see item 2, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations," for tabular presentations of net sales by geographic region.
in addition, certain customers have experienced significant ownership or management changes, consolidated with other manufacturers, outsourced manufacturing activities, or engaged in collaboration or cooperation arrangements with other manufacturers. customers have entered into strategic alliances or industry consortia that have increased the influence of key industry participants in technology decisions made by their partners. also, certain customers are making an increasingly greater percentage of their respective industry's capital equipment investments. further, claims or litigation involving key industry participants have resulted and may continue to result in changes in their sourcing strategies and other outcomes. in this environment, contracts or orders from a relatively limited number of manufacturers have accounted for, and are expected to continue to account for, a substantial portion of applied's business. the mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year. as applied's products are configured to customer specifications, changing, rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant, non-recoverable costs. if customers do not place orders, or they substantially reduce, delay or cancel orders, applied may not be able to replace the business, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations. major customers may also seek, and on occasion receive, pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that are less favorable to applied.
applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business.
in fiscal 2015, approximately 83 percent of applied's net sales were to customers in regions outside the united states. moreover, china now represents the largest market for various electronic products, such as tvs, pcs, and smartphones. certain of applied's r&d and manufacturing facilities, as well as suppliers to applied, are also located outside the united states, including in singapore, taiwan, china, korea, israel, germany and italy. applied is also expanding its business and operations in new countries. the global nature of applied's business and operations, combined with the need to continually improve the company's operating cost structure, presents challenges, including but not limited to those arising from:
•   varying regional and geopolitical business conditions and demands;
•   political and social attitudes, laws, rules, regulations and policies within countries that favor domestic companies over non-domestic companies, including customer- or government-supported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors;
•   customer- or government-supported efforts to influence applied to conduct more of its operations and sourcing in a particular country, such as korea and china;
•   variations among, and changes in, local, regional, national or international laws and regulations (including intellectual property, labor, tax, and import/export laws), as well as the interpretation and application of such laws and regulations;
•   global trade issues, including those related to the interpretation and application of import and export licenses, as well as international trade disputes;
18
•   positions taken by governmental agencies regarding possible national commercial and/or security issues posed by international business operations;
•   fluctuating raw material, commodity, energy and shipping costs or shipping delays;
•   challenges associated with managing more geographically diverse operations and projects, which require an effective organizational structure and appropriate business processes, procedures and controls;
•   a more diverse workforce with different experience levels, cultures, customs, business practices and worker expectations;
•   variations in the ability to develop relationships with local customers, suppliers and governments;
•   fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates, including the relative strength or weakness of the u.s. dollar against the japanese yen, euro, taiwanese dollar, israeli shekel or chinese yuan;
•   the need to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations around the world;
•   political instability, natural disasters (such as earthquakes, floods or storms), pandemics, social unrest, terrorism or acts of war in locations where applied has operations, suppliers or sales, or that may influence the value chain of the industries that applied serves;
•   the need for an effective business continuity plan if a disaster or other event occurs that could disrupt business operations;
•   the need to regularly reassess the size, capability and location of global infrastructure and make appropriate changes;
•   cultural and language differences;
•   difficulties and uncertainties associated with the entry into new countries;
•   hiring and integration of an increasing number of new workers, including in countries such as india and china;
•   the increasing need for the workforce to be more mobile and work in or travel to different regions;
•   uncertainties with respect to economic growth rates in various countries; and
•   uncertainties with respect to growth rates for the manufacture and sale of semiconductors, displays and solar pvs in the developing economies of certain countries.
many of these challenges are present in china and korea, which are experiencing significant growth of customers, suppliers and competitors to applied. applied further believes that china and korea present large potential markets for its products and opportunity for growth over the long term, although at lower projected levels of profitability and margins for certain products than historically have been achieved in other regions.
applied is exposed to risks associated with business combinations, acquisitions and strategic investments.
applied has made, and in the future may make, acquisitions of or investments in companies, technologies or products in existing, related or new markets for applied. business combinations, acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks that vary depending on their scale and nature, including but not limited to:
•   diversion of management's attention from other operational matters;
•   contractual restrictions on the conduct of applied's business during the pendency of a proposed transaction;
•   inability to complete proposed transactions as anticipated or at all and any ensuing obligation to pay a termination fee;
•   the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns;
•   requirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures and/or restrictions on the conduct of applied's existing business or the acquired business;
•   ineffective integration of operations, systems, technologies, products or employees, which can impact the ability to realize anticipated synergies or other benefits;
19
•   failure to commercialize purchased technologies;
•   initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners;
•   inability to capitalize on characteristics of new markets that may be significantly different from applied's existing markets and where competitors may have stronger market positions and customer relationships;
•   failure to attract, retain and motivate key employees;
•   the potential impact of the announcement or consummation of a proposed transaction on relationships with third parties;
•   potential changes in applied's credit rating, which could adversely impact the company's access to and cost of capital;
•   reductions in cash balances and/or increases in debt obligations to finance activities associated with a transaction, which reduce the availability of cash flow for general corporate or other purposes;
•   exposure to new operational risks, rules, regulations, worker expectations, customs and practices to the extent acquired businesses are located in regions where applied has not historically conducted business;
•   challenges associated with managing new, more diverse and more widespread operations, projects and people;
•   inability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights in key technologies;
•   inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company's internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and/or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices;
•   impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions, technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the segment;
•   the risk of litigation or claims associated with a proposed or completed transaction;
•   unknown, underestimated and/or undisclosed commitments or liabilities; and
•   the inappropriate scale of acquired entities' critical resources or facilities for business needs.
applied also makes strategic investments in other companies, including companies formed as joint ventures, which may decline in value and/or not meet desired objectives. the success of these investments depends on various factors over which applied may have limited or no control and, particularly with respect to joint ventures, requires ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic partners. the risks to applied's strategic investment portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions and, as a result, the value of the investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges.
applied's indebtedness and debt covenants could adversely affect its financial condition and business.
applied has $3.35 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding. under the indenture governing the senior unsecured notes, it may be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon a change of control of applied and a contemporaneous downgrade of the notes below investment grade. applied also has in place a $1.5 billion committed revolving credit agreement. while no amounts were outstanding under this credit agreement at october 25, 2015, applied may borrow amounts in the future under the agreement. applied may also enter into new financing arrangements. applied's ability to satisfy its debt obligations is dependent upon the results of its business operations and other risks discussed in this section. significant changes in applied's credit rating or changes in the interest rate environment could have a material adverse consequence on applied's access to and cost of capital for future financings, and financial condition. if applied fails to satisfy its debt obligations, or comply with financial and other debt covenants, it may be in default and any borrowings may become immediately due and payable, and such default may also constitute a default under other of applied's obligations. there can be no assurance that applied would have sufficient financial resources or be able to arrange financing to repay any borrowings at such time.
operating in multiple industries, and the entry into new markets and industries, entail additional challenges and obligations.
as part of its growth strategy, applied must successfully expand into related or new markets and industries, either with its existing products or with new products developed internally or obtained through acquisitions. the entry into different markets involves additional challenges, including those arising from:
•   the need to devote additional resources to develop new products for, and operate in, new markets;
•   the need to develop new sales and technical marketing strategies, cultivate relationships with new customers and meet different customer service requirements;
•   differing rates of profitability and growth among multiple businesses;
•   applied's ability to anticipate demand, capitalize on opportunities, and avoid or minimize risks;
20
•   the complexity of managing multiple businesses with variations in production planning, execution, supply chain management and logistics;
•   the adoption of new business models, business processes and systems;
•   applied's ability to rapidly expand or reduce its operations to meet increased or decreased demand, respectively, and the associated effect on working capital;
•   new materials, processes and technologies;
•   the need to attract, motivate and retain employees with skills and expertise in these new areas;
•   new and more diverse customers and suppliers, including some with limited operating histories, uncertain and/or limited funding, evolving business models and/or locations in regions where applied does not have, or has limited, operations;
•   new or different competitors with potentially more financial or other resources, industry experience and/or established customer relationships;
•   entry into new industries and countries, with differing levels of government involvement, laws and regulations, and business, employment and safety practices;
•   third parties' intellectual property rights; and
•   the need to comply with, or work to establish, industry standards and practices.
in addition, applied from time to time receives funding from united states and other government agencies for certain strategic development programs to increase its research and development resources and address new market opportunities. as a condition to this government funding, applied may be subject to certain record-keeping, audit, intellectual property rights-sharing and/or other obligations.
manufacturing interruptions or delays could affect applied's ability to meet customer demand and lead to higher costs, while the failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete inventory.
applied's business depends on its timely supply of equipment, services and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of its customers, which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts, components and subassemblies (collectively, parts) from suppliers, including contract manufacturers. some key parts are subject to long lead-times and/or obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers, and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers located in countries other than the countries where applied conducts its manufacturing, including china and korea. cyclical industry conditions and the volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment increase capital, technical, operational and other risks for applied and for companies throughout its supply chain. further, these conditions may cause some suppliers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other companies, or file for bankruptcy protection and possibly cease operations. applied may also experience significant interruptions of its manufacturing operations, delays in its ability to deliver products or services, increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of:
•   the failure or inability of suppliers to timely deliver sufficient quantities of quality parts on a cost-effective basis;
•   volatility in the availability and cost of materials, including rare earth elements;
•   difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals;
•   information technology or infrastructure failures; and
•   natural disasters or other events beyond applied's control (such as earthquakes, floods or storms, regional economic downturns, pandemics, social unrest, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war), particularly where it conducts manufacturing.
if a supplier fails to meet applied's requirements concerning quality, cost, socially-responsible business practices, or other performance factors, applied may transfer its business to alternative sources, which could entail manufacturing delays, additional costs, or other difficulties. in addition, if applied needs to rapidly increase its business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules, this may exacerbate any interruptions in applied's manufacturing operations and supply chain and the associated effect on applied's working capital. moreover, if actual demand for applied's products is different than expected, applied may purchase more/fewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or expediting delivery of parts. if applied purchases inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize, or if customers reduce or delay orders, applied may incur excess inventory charges.
21
the ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital to applied's success.
applied's success, competitiveness and ability to execute on its global strategies and maintain a culture of innovation depend in large part on its ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees, especially in critical positions. achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, management changes, applied's organizational structure, hiring practices of competitors and other companies, cost reduction activities (including workforce reductions and unpaid shutdowns), availability of career development opportunities, the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries, and the effectiveness of applied's compensation and benefit programs, including its share-based programs. restructuring programs present particular challenges to the extent they involve the departure of knowledgeable and experienced employees and the resulting need to identify and train existing or new workers to perform necessary functions, which may result in unexpected costs, reduced productivity, and/or difficulties with respect to internal processes and controls.
applied is exposed to various risks related to protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights.
applied's success depends in significant part on the protection of its intellectual property and other rights. infringement of applied's rights by a third party, such as the unauthorized manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts, could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for applied. policing any unauthorized use of intellectual property is difficult and costly and applied cannot be certain that the measures it has implemented will prevent misuse. applied's intellectual property rights may not provide significant competitive advantages if they are circumvented, invalidated, rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, or if applied does not adequately protect or assert these rights or obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms. furthermore, the laws and practices of other countries, including china, india, taiwan and korea, permit the protection and enforcement of applied's rights to varying extents, which may not be sufficient to adequately protect applied's rights. in addition, changes in intellectual property laws or their interpretation, such as recent changes in u.s. patent laws, may impact applied's ability to protect and assert its intellectual property rights, increase costs and uncertainties in the prosecution of patent applications and enforcement or defense of issued patents, and diminish the value of applied's intellectual property.
applied is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and incidents.
in the conduct of its business, applied collects, uses, transmits and stores data on information technology systems. this data includes confidential information belonging to applied or its customers or other business partners, as well as personally-identifiable information of individuals. applied has experienced, and expects to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents, ranging from employee error or misuse to individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, none of which have been material to the company to date. applied devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption and other measures to protect its systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse. however, depending on their nature and scope, cybersecurity incidents could result in business disruption; the misappropriation, corruption or loss of confidential information and critical data (applied's and that of third parties); reputational damage; litigation with third parties; diminution in the value of applied's investment in research, development and engineering; data privacy issues; and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs.
applied is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings.
applied from time to time is, and in the future may be, involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement, intellectual property rights, antitrust, environmental regulations, securities, contracts, product performance, product liability, unfair competition, misappropriation of trade secrets, employment, workplace safety, and other matters. applied also on occasion receives notification from customers who believe that applied owes them indemnification or other obligations related to claims made against such customers by third parties.
legal proceedings and claims, whether with or without merit, and associated internal investigations, may (1) be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute, defend or conduct; (2) divert management's attention and other applied resources; (3) inhibit applied's ability to sell its products; (4) result in adverse judgments for damages, injunctive relief, penalties and fines; and/or (5) negatively affect applied's business. there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings, claims or investigations.
22
the failure to successfully implement and conduct outsourcing activities and other operational initiatives could adversely affect results of operations.
to better align its costs with market conditions, locate closer to customers, enhance productivity, and improve efficiencies, applied conducts certain engineering, software development, manufacturing, sourcing and other operations in regions outside the united states, including india, taiwan, china, and korea. applied has implemented a distributed manufacturing model, under which certain manufacturing and supply chain activities are conducted in various countries, including germany, israel, italy, singapore, taiwan, the united states and other countries in asia, and assembly of some systems is completed at customer sites. in addition, applied outsources certain functions to third parties, including companies in the united states, india, china, korea, malaysia and other countries. outsourced functions include contract manufacturing, engineering, customer support, software development, information technology support, finance and administrative activities. the expanding role of third party providers has required changes to applied's existing operations and the adoption of new procedures and processes for retaining and managing these providers, as well as redistributing responsibilities as warranted, in order to realize the potential productivity and operational efficiencies, assure quality and continuity of supply, and protect the intellectual property of applied and its customers, suppliers and other partners. if applied does not accurately forecast the amount, timing and mix of demand for products, or if contract manufacturers or other outsource providers fail to perform in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, applied's ability to meet customer requirements could suffer, particularly during a market upturn.
in addition, applied must regularly implement or update comprehensive programs and processes to better align its global organizations, including initiatives to enhance its supply chain and improve back office and information technology infrastructure for more efficient transaction processing. the implementation of new processes and additional functionality to the existing systems entails certain risks, including difficulties with changes in business processes that could disrupt applied's operations, such as its ability to track orders and timely ship products, project inventory requirements, manage its supply chain and aggregate financial and operational data. during transitions applied must continue to rely on legacy information systems, which may be costly or inefficient, while the implementation of new initiatives may not achieve the anticipated benefits and may divert management's attention from other operational activities, or have other unintended consequences.
if applied does not effectively develop and implement its outsourcing and relocation strategies, if required export and other governmental approvals are not timely obtained, if applied's third party providers do not perform as anticipated, or if there are delays or difficulties in enhancing business processes, applied may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies, and may experience operational difficulties, increased costs (including energy and transportation), manufacturing interruptions or delays, inefficiencies in the structure and/or operation of its supply chain, loss of its intellectual property rights, quality issues, reputational harm, increased product time-to-market, and/or inefficient allocation of human resources.
applied may incur impairment charges to goodwill or long-lived assets.
applied has a significant amount of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions. goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. the review compares the fair value for each of applied's reporting units to its associated carrying value, including goodwill. factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include adverse industry or economic trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, declines in the market price of applied common stock, changes in applied's strategies or product portfolio, and restructuring activities. applied's valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance. applied may be required to record future charges to earnings during the period in which an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets is determined to exist.

changes in tax rates or tax assets and liabilities could affect results of operations.
as a global company, applied is subject to taxation in the united states and various other jurisdictions. significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities. applied's future provision for income taxes and tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in the: (1) applicable tax laws; (2) amount and composition of pre-tax income in jurisdictions with differing tax rates; (3) plans to indefinitely reinvest certain funds held outside of the u.s.; and (4) valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
consistent with the international nature of its business, applied conducts certain manufacturing, supply chain, and other operations in asia, bringing these activities closer to customers and reducing operating costs. applied has received authorization to use tax incentives that provide that income earned in certain countries outside the u.s. will be subject to tax holidays or reduced income tax rates. to obtain the benefit of these tax incentives, applied must meet requirements relating to various activities. applied's ability to realize benefits from these incentives could be materially affected if, among other things, applicable requirements are not met or applied incurs net losses for which it cannot claim a deduction.
in addition, applied is subject to regular examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities, and from time to time initiates amendments to previously filed tax returns. applied regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and amendments to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes, which requires estimates and judgments. although applied believes its tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the tax authorities will agree with such estimates. applied may have to engage in litigation to achieve the results reflected in the estimates, which may be time-consuming and expensive. there can be no assurance that applied will be successful or that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in applied's historical income tax provisions and accruals.
applied is subject to risks of non-compliance with environmental and safety regulations.
applied is subject to environmental and safety regulations in connection with its global business operations, including but not limited to: regulations related to the development, manufacture and use of its products; recycling and disposal of materials used in its products or in producing its products; the operation of its facilities; and the use of its real property. the failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental and safety regulations, such as those related to climate change, could result in: (1) significant remediation liabilities; (2) the imposition of fines; (3) the suspension or termination of the development, manufacture, sale or use of certain of its products; (4) limitations on the operation of its facilities or ability to use its real property; and/or (5) a decrease in the value of its real property.
applied is exposed to various risks related to the regulatory environment.
applied is subject to various risks related to: (1) new, different, inconsistent or conflicting laws, rules and regulations that may be enacted by executive order, legislative bodies or regulatory agencies in the countries in which applied operates; (2) disagreements or disputes between national or regional regulatory agencies related to international trade; and (3) the interpretation and application of laws, rules and regulations. as a public company with global operations, applied is subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, including those related to financial and other disclosures, corporate governance, privacy, and anti-corruption. changes and ambiguities in laws, regulations and standards create uncertainty and challenges regarding compliance matters. efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.
item 7:   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) is intended to facilitate an understanding of applied's business and results of operations. this md&a should be read in conjunction with applied's consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k. the following discussion contains forward-looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the cautionary statement set forth at the beginning of this form 10-k. md&a consists of the following sections:
•   overview: a summary of applied's business and measurements
•   results of operations: a discussion of operating results
•   segment information: a discussion of segment operating results
•   business combinations: a summary of announced or completed business combinations and acquisitions
•   recent accounting pronouncements: a discussion of new accounting pronouncements and its impact to applied's consolidated financial statements
•   financial condition, liquidity and capital resources: an analysis of cash flows, sources and uses of cash
•   off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations
•   critical accounting policies and estimates: a discussion of critical accounting policies that require the exercise of judgments and estimates
•   non-gaap adjusted results: a presentation of results reconciling gaap to non-gaap adjusted measures overview applied provides manufacturing equipment, services and software to the global semiconductor, display, solar photovoltaic (pv) and related industries. applied's customers include manufacturers of semiconductor wafers and chips, liquid crystal and other displays, solar pv cells and modules, and other electronic devices. these customers may use what they manufacture in their own end products or sell the items to other companies for use in advanced electronic components. applied operates in four reportable segments: silicon systems, applied global services, display, and energy and environmental solutions. a summary of financial information for each reportable segment is found in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements. a discussion of factors that could affect applied's operations is set forth under "risk factors" in part i, item 1a, which is incorporated herein by reference. product development and manufacturing activities occur primarily in the united states, europe, israel, and asia. applied's broad range of equipment and service products are highly technical and are sold primarily through a direct sales force.
applied's results are driven primarily by worldwide demand for semiconductors, which in turn depends on end-user demand for electronic products. each of applied's businesses is subject to cyclical industry conditions, as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for chips, display technologies, solar pvs and other electronic devices, as well as other factors, such as global economic and market conditions, and the nature and timing of technological advances in fabrication processes. in addition, a significant driver in the semiconductor and display industries is end-demand for mobile consumer products, which is characterized by seasonality that impacts the timing of customer investments in manufacturing equipment and, in turn, applied's business. in light of these conditions, applied's results can vary significantly year-over-year, as well as quarter-over-quarter.
applied's strategic priorities for fiscal 2016 include developing products that help solve customers' challenges at technology inflections; expanding its served market opportunities in the semiconductor and display industries; and growing its services business.
on april 26, 2015, applied and tokyo electron limited (tel) announced that they had mutually agreed to terminate their previously announced business combination agreement, which was entered into on september 24, 2013 and intended to effect a strategic combination of their respective business into a new combined company. no termination fee was payable by either applied or tel.

mobility, and the increasing technological functionality of mobile devices, continues to be the largest drivers of semiconductor industry spending. fiscal 2015 was characterized by steady demand for semiconductor equipment, with increased investment in technology upgrades and additional capacity by memory customers. demand from foundry customers reflected investments in new technology at advanced nodes, driven by demand for advanced mobile chips. mobility represented a significant driver of display industry spending during fiscal 2015, which resulted in continued manufacturing capacity expansion for mobile applications. demand for larger tvs was also a factor for display industry investments, although demand for tv manufacturing equipment remains susceptible to highly cyclical conditions. investment in solar equipment remained low during fiscal 2015 due to ongoing excess manufacturing capacity in the industry. gross margin challenges are expected in the first half of fiscal 2016 primarily due to higher demand for semiconductor equipment from memory customers and mobility display equipment.
applied expects the mobility trend to remain the main growth driver for the semiconductor industry, and in turn for silicon systems, in fiscal 2016. demand in the semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry is expected to be driven by foundry and memory spending. applied also expects semiconductor spares and services, and display equipment investment to remain healthy in fiscal 2016.
during fiscal 2014, demand for advanced mobile chips drove demand for semiconductor equipment by foundry customers. in addition, demand for semiconductor equipment from memory customers improved as manufacturers invested in technology upgrades. mobility and demand for larger tvs drove investment in display equipment during fiscal 2014. investment in solar equipment remained low during fiscal 2014, despite continued end-market growth, due to excess manufacturing capacity in the industry.
fiscal 2013 was characterized by strong demand for semiconductor equipment from foundry customers driven by demand for advanced mobile chips. in the second half of fiscal 2013, demand from foundry customers softened, while demand from memory and logic customers improved. display industry spending during fiscal 2013 reflected strong demand for mobile display equipment, as well as a recovery in demand for tv manufacturing equipment compared to weak industry levels in fiscal 2012. investment in solar equipment remained low during fiscal 2013 due to continued excess manufacturing capacity in the industry.

applied's future operating results depend to a considerable extent on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the equipment and service products it provides. development cycles range from 12 to 36 months depending on whether the product is an enhancement of an existing product, which typically has a shorter development cycle, or a new product, which typically has a longer development cycle. most of applied's existing products resulted from internal development activities and innovations involving new technologies, materials and processes. in certain instances, applied acquires technologies, either in existing or new product areas, to complement its existing technology capabilities and to reduce time to market.
management believes that it is critical to continue to make substantial investments in rd&e to assure the availability of innovative technology that meets the current and projected requirements of its customers' most advanced designs. applied has maintained and intends to continue its commitment to investing in rd&e in order to continue to offer new products and technologies.
in fiscal 2015, applied increased its investments in new product growth in etch, chemical vapor deposition, high throughput atomic layer deposition, and next generation inspection technology. applied's investments in etch and chemical vapor deposition were focused on supporting the adoption of the etch centris sym 3 product and customer ramps of 3d nand technology.  applied's investment in atomic layer deposition is yielding products to address customer needs for future nodes, and investments in inspection include a new e-beam inspection platform and improved brightfield capabilities.
rd&e expenses increased in fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year and also in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013, reflecting the impact of ongoing product development initiatives. as part of its growth strategy, applied continued to reprioritize existing spend, to enable increased funding for investments in technical capabilities and critical rd&e programs in current and new markets, with a focus on semiconductor technologies. rd&e expense during fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 included $69 million, $66 million and $53 million, respectively, of share-based compensation expense.

changes in gain or loss on derivatives associated with the terminated business combination with tel resulted from the sale of derivative contracts and exchange rate fluctuations. due to the termination of the proposed business combination, the derivatives were sold during the third quarter of fiscal 2015. for further details, see note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and 2014, applied performed a qualitative assessment to test goodwill for all of its reporting units for impairment. applied determined that it was more likely than not that each of its reporting units' fair values exceeded its respective carrying values and that it was not necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test for any of its reporting units.
during fiscal 2013, the solar industry faced continued deterioration in market conditions associated with manufacturing overcapacity and weak operating performance and outlook, resulting in uncertainties regarding the timing and nature of a recovery in solar capital equipment expenditures. applied performed a two-step goodwill impairment test and, as a result, recorded $224 million of goodwill impairment charges in its energy and environmental solutions segment in fiscal 2013. applied also recorded a $54 million impairment charge related to intangible assets in the energy and environmental solutions segment in fiscal 2013.
the evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment requires the exercise of significant judgment. in the event of future changes in business conditions, applied will reassess and update its forecasts and estimates used in future impairment analyses. if the results of these analyses are lower than current estimates, a material impairment charge may result at that time.

the increase in restructuring and asset impairments, net for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to the cost reduction measures in the solar business taken during fiscal 2015 to achieve a lower break-even level and improve business performance. the decrease in restructuring and asset impairments, net for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was due to completion of the principal activities for the previously announced restructuring plans. also in fiscal 2013, applied incurred $2 million of severance and other employee-related costs in connection with the integration of varian semiconductor equipment associates, inc.
on october 3, 2012, applied announced a restructuring plan (the 2012 global restructuring plan) to realign its global workforce and enhance its ability to invest for growth. under this plan, applied implemented a voluntary retirement program and other workforce reduction actions that affected approximately 1,300 positions. as of january 26, 2014, principal activities related to this plan were complete. during fiscal 2014 and 2013, applied recognized $5 million and $39 million, respectively, of employee-related costs in connection with the 2012 global restructuring plan. total costs incurred in implementing this plan were $150 million, none of which were allocated to the operating segments.
on may 10, 2012, applied announced a plan (the 2012 ees restructuring plan) to restructure its energy and environmental solutions segment in light of challenging industry conditions affecting the solar photovoltaic and light-emitting diode (led) equipment markets. total costs incurred in implementing this plan were $87 million, of which $13 million were inventory-related charges. during fiscal 2015, applied recorded a favorable adjustment of $2 million associated with restructuring reserves under this program. during fiscal 2013, applied recognized $26 million, of restructuring and asset impairment charges in connection with the 2012 ees restructuring plan. these costs were reported in the energy and environmental solutions and applied global services segments.

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was lower than the rate for fiscal 2014 primarily due to acquisition costs that became deductible in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 as a result of the termination of the proposed business combination with tel, an adjustment in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 to correct an error in the recognition of cost of sales in the u.s. related to intercompany sales, reinstatement of the u.s. federal research and development tax credit during the first quarter of fiscal 2015 which was retroactive to its expiration in december 2013, resolutions and changes related to income tax liabilities for prior years, and changes in the geographical composition of income.
the effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was lower than the rate for fiscal 2013 due primarily to nondeductible goodwill impairment charges in fiscal 2013, offset by resolutions and changes related to prior years and expiration of the u.s. federal research and development tax credit.

segment information applied reports financial results in four segments: silicon systems, applied global services, display, and energy and environmental solutions. a description of the products and services, as well as financial data, for each reportable segment can be found in note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements. applied does not allocate to its reportable segments certain operating expenses that it manages separately at the corporate level. these unallocated costs include costs for share-based compensation; certain management, finance, legal, human resource, and rd&e functions provided at the corporate level; and unabsorbed information technology and occupancy. in addition, applied does not allocate to its reportable segments restructuring and asset impairment charges and any associated adjustments related to restructuring actions, unless these actions pertain to a specific reportable segment.
the results for each reportable segment are discussed below.
silicon systems segment the silicon systems segment includes semiconductor capital equipment for deposition, etch, ion implantation, rapid thermal processing, chemical mechanical planarization, metrology and inspection, and wafer packaging. development efforts are focused on solving customers' key technical challenges in transistor, patterning, interconnect and packaging performance as devices scale to advanced technology nodes. the mobility trend remains the largest influence on industry spending, as it drives device manufacturers to continually improve their ability to deliver high-performance, low-power processors and affordable solid-state storage in a small form factor.
the competitive environment for silicon systems in fiscal 2015 reflected continued investment by semiconductor manufacturers. memory manufacturers increased investments in technology upgrades and additional capacity. foundry investments reflected demand for new technology as customers ramp wafer starts at advanced nodes to meet demand for advanced mobile chips, but decreased primarily due to customers managing excess inventory, improving yields and re-using equipment.

cash provided by operating activities                $1,163           $1,800                 $623
cash provided by (used in) investing activities       $(281   )       $(161       )          $215
cash provided by (used in) financing activities        $913           $(348       )         $(519   )
operating activities cash from operating activities for fiscal 2015 was $1.2 billion, which reflects net income adjusted for the effect of non-cash charges and changes in working capital components. non-cash charges included depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation, restructuring and asset impairments and deferred income taxes. the primary drivers of the decrease in cash from operating activities from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015 were the increases in inventories and deferred income taxes and decreases in accounts payable, accrued expenses, customer deposits, deferred revenue and income taxes payable, partially offset by higher net income. the increase in cash from operating activities from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to higher business volume and improved working capital performance.
applied did not utilize programs to discount letters of credit issued by customers in fiscal 2015 and 2013. applied discounted $29 million of letters of credit issued by customers in fiscal 2014. discounting of letters of credit depends on many factors, including the willingness of financial institutions to discount the letters of credit and the cost of such arrangements. applied did not factor accounts receivable nor discounted promissory notes in fiscal 2015 and 2013. applied factored accounts receivable and discounted promissory notes of $45 million in fiscal 2014.
applied's working capital was $5.5 billion at october 25, 2015 and $4.1 billion at october 26, 2014.
days sales, inventory and payable outstanding at the end of each of the periods indicated were:
2015                                  2014      2013
days sales outstanding        67        67        75
days inventory outstanding   118       109       108
days payable outstanding      42        43        44
days sales outstanding varies due to the timing of shipments and the payment terms. days sales outstanding remained flat at the end of fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. the decrease for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to an increase in revenue and better linearity. days inventory outstanding increased at the end of fiscal 2015 reflecting higher inventory near the end of the period due to increase in deferred inventory and more builds as compared to revenue turns. days inventory outstanding remained flat in fiscal 2014 and 2013. days payable outstanding remained relatively flat in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013.
45
investing activities applied used $281 million of cash in investing activities in fiscal 2015 and $161 million in fiscal 2014. applied generated $215 million in cash from investing activities in fiscal 2013. capital expenditures in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $215 million, $241 million and $197 million, respectively. capital expenditures in fiscal 2015 were primarily for demonstration and test equipment and laboratory tools in north america. capital expenditures in fiscal 2014 were primarily for demonstration and test equipment and infrastructure improvements in north america, including creation of a new pilot operation facility and distribution center. capital expenditures in fiscal 2013 were primarily for demonstration and test equipment as well as laboratory tools and equipment upgrades in north america. purchases of investments, net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments was $62 million for fiscal 2015 and proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, net of purchases of investments totaled $67 million and $406 million in fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively. investing activities also included investments in technology to allow applied to access new market opportunities or emerging technologies.
applied's investment portfolio consists principally of investment grade money market mutual funds, u.s. treasury and agency securities, municipal bonds, corporate bonds and mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, as well as equity securities. applied regularly monitors the credit risk in its investment portfolio and takes appropriate measures, which may include the sale of certain securities, to manage such risks prudently in accordance with its investment policies.
financing activities applied generated $913 million of cash from financing activities in fiscal 2015, consisting primarily of net proceeds received from the issuance of senior unsecured notes of $1.8 billion and short-term borrowings by a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary of $800 million, offset by cash used for repurchases of its common stock of $1.3 billion and payment of cash dividends of $487 million. applied used cash in financing activities in fiscal 2014 and 2013 of $348 million and $519 million, respectively, which included payment of cash dividends to stockholders and issuances of common stock. applied made no repurchases of its common stock in fiscal 2014 and used cash to repurchase shares of its common stock in fiscal 2013 of $245 million. on april 26, 2015, applied's board of directors approved a common stock repurchase program authorizing up to $3.0 billion in repurchases over the three years ending april 2018. at october 25, 2015, $1.7 billion remained available for future stock repurchases under this repurchase program. applied's prior stock repurchase program ended in march 2015. proceeds from stock issuances under equity compensation awards and related excess tax benefits in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $144 million, $137 million and $182 million, respectively.
during each of fiscal 2015 and 2014, applied's board of directors declared four quarterly cash dividends of $0.10 per share. during fiscal 2013, applied's board of directors declared three quarterly cash dividends of $0.10 per share and one quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share. cash paid in dividends during fiscal 2015, 2014 and fiscal 2013 amounted to $487 million, $485 million and $456 million, respectively. applied currently anticipates that cash dividends will continue to be paid on a quarterly basis, although the declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on applied's financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as a determination by the board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interests of applied's stockholders.
applied has credit facilities for unsecured borrowings in various currencies of up to $1.6 billion. in september 2015, applied entered into a $1.5 billion committed revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that is scheduled to expire in september 2020. this credit agreement provides for borrowings in united states dollars at interest rates keyed to one of various benchmark rates selected by applied for each advance, plus a margin based on applied's public debt rating, and includes financial and other covenants with which applied was in compliance at october 25, 2015. remaining credit facilities in the amount of approximately $67 million are with japanese banks. applied's ability to borrow under these facilities is subject to bank approval at the time of the borrowing request, and any advances will be at rates indexed to the banks' prime reference rate denominated in japanese yen. no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities at both october 25, 2015 and october 26, 2014, and applied has not utilized these credit facilities.
in fiscal 2011, applied established a short-term commercial paper program of up to $1.5 billion. at october 25, 2015 and october 26, 2014, applied did not have any commercial paper outstanding, but may issue commercial paper notes under this program from time to time in the future.
in september 2015, applied issued senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1.8 billion. the indenture governing the notes includes certain covenants with which applied was in compliance at october 25, 2015. in november 2015, applied completed the redemption of the entire outstanding $400 million in principal amount of senior notes due in 2016. the redemption price was $405 million, and after adjusting for the carrying value of the debt issuance costs and discounts, applied recorded a $5 million loss on the prepayment of the $400 million debt, which will be included in non-operating loss in the consolidated statement of operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. see note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of long-term debt. in october 2015, a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary of applied entered into a short-term loan agreement, guaranteed by applied, under which it borrowed $800 million to facilitate the return of capital to applied.
46
others during fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, applied did not record any additional bad debt provision but released $9 million, $16 million and $13 million, respectively, of its allowance for doubtful accounts as a result of an overall lower risk profile of applied's customers. while applied believes that its allowance for doubtful accounts at october 25, 2015 is adequate, it will continue to closely monitor customer liquidity and economic conditions.
as of october 25, 2015, approximately $2.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries may be subject to u.s. taxes if repatriated for u.s. operations. of this amount, applied intends to indefinitely reinvest approximately $2.3 billion of these funds outside of the u.s. and does not plan to repatriate these funds. for the remaining cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries, u.s. taxes have been provided for in the financial statements.
although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of factors such as those discussed above, applied's management believes that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability, will be sufficient to satisfy applied's liquidity requirements for the next 12 months. for further details regarding applied's operating, investing and financing activities, see the consolidated statements of cash flows in this report.
for details on standby letters of credit and other agreements with banks, see off-balance sheet arrangements below.
47
off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either applied or its subsidiaries. as of october 25, 2015, the maximum potential amount of future payments that applied could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was approximately $58 million. applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee agreements beyond that required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed. applied does not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee agreements.
applied also has agreements with various banks to facilitate subsidiary banking operations worldwide, including overdraft arrangements, issuance of bank guarantees, and letters of credit. as of october 25, 2015, applied materials inc. has provided parent guarantees to banks for approximately $100 million to cover these arrangements.
applied also has operating leases for various facilities. total rent expense for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $32 million, $37 million and $36 million, respectively.

2   other long-term liabilities in the table do not include pension, post-retirement and deferred compensation plans due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments. applied evaluates the need to make contributions to its pension and post-retirement benefit plans after considering the funded status of the plans, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. payments to the plans would be dependent on these factors and could vary across a wide range of amounts and time periods. payments for deferred compensation plans are dependent on activity by participants, making the timing of payments uncertain. information on applied's pension, post-retirement benefit and deferred compensation plans is presented in note 13, employee benefit plans, of the consolidated financial statements.
3   other long-term liabilities in the table do not include noncurrent income taxes payable, noncurrent deferred income taxes payable and certain tax-related liabilities classified as other noncurrent liabilities on the balance sheet, due to the uncertainty in the timing and amount of future payments. as of october 25, 2015, the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits that was not expected to result in payment of cash within one year was $177 million. interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions that were not expected to result in payment of cash within one year of october 25, 2015 and october 26, 2014 were $14 million and $25 million, respectively.

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies.
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of applied's consolidated financial statements and that requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on applied's financial condition or results of operations. specifically, these policies have the following attributes: (1) applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate; and (2) different estimates applied could reasonably have used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, would have a material effect on applied's financial condition or results of operations.
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances. these estimates may change as new events occur, as additional information is obtained and as applied's operating environment changes. these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known. in addition, management is periodically faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time. these uncertainties include those discussed in part i, item 1a, "risk factors." based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies, management believes that applied's consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america, and provide a meaningful presentation of applied's financial condition and results of operations.
management believes that the following are critical accounting policies and estimates:
revenue recognition applied recognizes revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is probable. each sale arrangement may contain commercial terms that differ from other arrangements. in addition, applied frequently enters into contracts that contain multiple deliverables. judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units. moreover, judgment is used in interpreting the commercial terms and determining when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period. while changes in the allocation of the estimated sales price between the units of accounting will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular sales arrangement, any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition, which could have a material effect on applied's financial condition and results of operations.
warranty costs applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized. estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product, current and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs. applied's warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates, material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period. as applied's customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally, labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs. the quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs. unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs. if actual warranty costs differ substantially from applied's estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required, which could have a material adverse effect on applied's business, financial condition and results of operations.
allowance for doubtful accounts applied maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. this allowance is based on historical experience, credit evaluations, specific customer collection history and any customer-specific issues applied has identified. changes in circumstances, such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer's ability to meet its financial obligation to applied or its payment trends, may require applied to further adjust its estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to applied, which could have a material adverse effect on applied's business, financial condition and results of operations.
49
inventory valuation inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand. applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand. in addition, inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products. if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated, additional adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required, which could have a material adverse effect on applied's business, financial condition and results of operations.
goodwill and intangible assets applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable, and also annually reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives for impairment. intangible assets, such as purchased technology, are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition. the value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates, applied may be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value.
to test goodwill for impairment, applied first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. if it is concluded that this is the case, applied then performs the two-step goodwill impairment test. otherwise, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. under the two-step goodwill impairment test, applied would in the first step compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, applied would then perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. if applied determines that the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, applied would record an impairment charge equal to the difference.
applied determines the fair value of each reporting unit based on a weighting of an income and a market approach. applied bases the fair value estimates on assumptions that it believes to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. under the income approach, applied estimates the fair value based on discounted cash flow method.
the estimates used in the impairment testing are consistent with the discrete forecasts that applied uses to manage its business, and considers any significant developments during the period. under the discounted cash flow method, cash flows beyond the discrete forecasts are estimated using a terminal growth rate, which considers the long-term earnings growth rate specific to the reporting units. the estimated future cash flows are discounted to present value using each reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital. the weighted average cost of capital measures a reporting unit's cost of debt and equity financing weighted by the percentage of debt and equity in a reporting unit's target capital structure. in addition, the weighted average cost of capital is derived using both known and estimated market metrics, and is adjusted to reflect both the timing and risks associated with the estimated cash flows. the tax rate used in the discounted cash flow method is the median tax rate of comparable companies and reflects applied's current international structure, which is consistent with the market participant perspective. under the market approach, applied uses the guideline company method which applies market multiples to forecasted revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. applied uses market multiples that are consistent with comparable publicly-traded companies and considers each reporting unit's size, growth and profitability relative to its comparable companies.
management uses significant judgment when assessing goodwill for potential impairment, especially in emerging markets. indicators of potential impairment include, but are not limited to, challenging economic conditions, an unfavorable industry or economic environment or other severe decline in market conditions. such conditions could have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates used for the fair value calculation, resulting in an unexpected goodwill impairment charge, which could have a material adverse effect on applied's business, financial condition and results of operations. see note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of goodwill impairment.
50
income taxes applied's effective tax rate is affected by the geographical composition of income and income tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions.
applied accounts for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities using statutory tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities, net operating losses and tax credit carryovers. deferred tax assets are also reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. management has determined that it is more likely than not that applied's future taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets, net of existing valuation allowance.
the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with applied's expectations could have a material impact on applied's results of operations and financial condition.
non-gaap adjusted results management uses non-gaap adjusted results to evaluate operating and financial performance in light of business objectives and for planning purposes. applied believes these measures enhance investors' ability to review the company's business from the same perspective as management and facilitate comparisons of this period's results with prior periods. the non-gaap adjusted results presented below exclude the impact of the following, where applicable: certain items related to acquisitions; restructuring charges and any associated adjustments; impairments of assets, goodwill, or investments; gain or loss on sale of strategic investments or facilities; and certain discrete adjustments and tax items. these non-gaap adjusted measures are not in accordance with gaap and may differ from non-gaap methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. the presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with gaap.

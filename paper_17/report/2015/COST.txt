item 1a-risk factors the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. these risks are not the only risks that we face. we could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the u.s. and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial. these risk factors should be carefully reviewed in conjunction with management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8 of this report.
business and operating risks we are highly dependent on the financial performance of our u.s. and canadian operations.
our financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our u.s. and canadian operations, which comprised 88% and 85% of net sales and operating income in 2015, respectively. within the u.s., we are highly dependent on our california operations, which comprised 31% of u.s. net sales in 2015. our california market, in general, has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other domestic markets. any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial results. declines in financial performance of our u.s. operations, particularly in california, and our canadian operations could arise from, among other things: declines in actual or estimated comparable warehouse sales growth rates and expectations; negative trends in operating expenses, including increased labor, healthcare and energy costs; failing to meet targets for warehouse openings; cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses; shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products; changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets, including higher levels of unemployment and depressed home values; and failing to consistently provide high quality products and innovative new products to retain our existing member base and attract new members.
we may be unsuccessful implementing our growth strategy, including expanding our business, both in existing markets and in new markets, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our growth is dependent, in part, on our ability to acquire property and build or lease new warehouses and regional depots. we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations. local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses and depots, as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses or depots at specific sites and the adoption of local laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations, may impact our ability to find suitable locations, and increase the cost of sites and of constructing, leasing and operating our warehouses and depots. we also may have difficulty negotiating leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms. in addition, certain jurisdictions have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operation or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs, including us, within their jurisdictions. failure to manage these and other similar factors effectively may affect our ability to timely build or lease new warehouses and depots, which could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and profitability.
we seek to expand our business in existing markets in order to attain a greater overall market share. a new warehouse may draw members away from our existing warehouses and adversely affect comparable warehouse sales performance and member traffic at those existing warehouses.
we intend to continue to open warehouses in new markets. the risks associated with entering a new market include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us, attracting members of other wholesale club operators, our lack of familiarity with local member preferences, and seasonal differences in the market. in addition, entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large, established market presence. we cannot ensure that our new warehouses and new online business websites will be profitably deployed and, as a result, our future profitability could be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected.

item 1a-risk factors (continued)
our failure to maintain positive membership loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our results of operations.
membership loyalty and growth are essential to our business model. the extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. damage to our brands or reputation may negatively impact comparable warehouse sales, diminish member trust, and reduce member renewal rates and, accordingly, net sales and membership fee revenue, negatively impacting our results of operations.
in addition, we sell many products under our private label kirkland signature brand. maintaining consistent product quality, competitive pricing, and availability of our kirkland signature products for our members is essential to developing and maintaining member loyalty. these products also generally carry higher margins than national brand products carried in our warehouses and represent a growing portion of our overall sales. if the kirkland signature brand experiences a loss of member acceptance or confidence, our sales and gross margin results could be adversely affected.
disruptions in our depot operations could adversely affect sales and member satisfaction.
we depend on the orderly operation of the merchandise receiving and distribution process, primarily through our depots. although we believe that our receiving and distribution process is efficient, unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fires, hurricanes, earthquakes or other catastrophic events, labor issues or other shipping problems may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our warehouses, which could adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our members.
we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, summarize results, and manage our business. failure to adequately update our systems and disruptions in both our primary and back-up systems could harm our ability to run our business and adversely affect our results of operations.
given the very high volume of transactions we process each year it is important that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical computer systems. our computer systems, including our back-up systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, internal or external security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes, and errors by our employees. if our computer systems or our back-up systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make significant investments to fix or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim. any material interruption in our computer systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
we are currently making, and will continue to make, significant technology investments to improve or replace our information processes and systems that are key to managing our business. failure to monitor and choose the right investments and implement them at the right pace would be harmful. the risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken, although we believe that our change management process can mitigate this risk. excessive technological change could impact the effectiveness of adoption, and could make it more difficult for us to realize benefits from the technology. targeting the wrong opportunities, failing to make the best investments, or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. additionally, the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term. these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost.
if we do not maintain the privacy and security of member-related and other business information, we could damage our reputation with members, incur substantial additional costs, and become subject to litigation.
we receive, retain, and transmit certain personal information about our members and entrust that information to third party business associates, including cloud service providers that perform activities for us. our online

item 1a-risk factors (continued)
business, which operates websites in the u.s., canada, u.k., and mexico, depends upon the secure transmission of encrypted confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. a compromise of our security systems or those of our business associates that results in our members' information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our members and others, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. in addition, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to the security of information systems and could result in a disruption of our operations.
the use of data by our business and our business associates is regulated at the national and state or local level in all of our operating countries. privacy and information security laws and regulations change, and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the development of new administrative processes. if we, or those with whom we share information, fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a data security breach, our reputation could be damaged, possibly resulting in lost future business, and we could be subjected to additional legal risk as a result of non-compliance.
our security measures may be undermined due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise, and, as a result an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate business and personal information. in july 2015, we discovered that the company that hosts our online photo center suffered a security breach that compromised information of users of the company's site, including some costco members. in response, that company implemented new technology with enhanced security features. additional data security breaches may occur in the future and may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, timely discover or counter them, or implement adequate preventative measures. any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and potentially have an adverse effect on our business.
we are subject to payment related risks.
we accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash and checks, a select variety of credit and debit cards, and our proprietary cash card. as we offer new payment options to our members, we may be subject to additional rules, regulations, compliance requirements, and higher fraud losses. for certain payment methods, we pay interchange and other related card acceptance fees, along with additional transaction processing fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs. we rely on third parties to provide payment transaction processing services, including the processing of credit and debit cards, and our proprietary cash card, and it could temporarily disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. we are also subject to payment card association rules and network operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change over time. if we fail to comply with these rules or transaction processing requirements, we may not be able to accept certain payment methods. in addition, if our internal systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for banks' compromised card re-issuance costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and/or debit card payments from our members, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.
we might sell unsafe products, resulting in illness or injury to our members, harm our reputation, and litigation.
if our merchandise offerings, including food and prepared food products for human consumption, drugs, children's products, pet products, and durable goods, do not meet or are perceived not to meet applicable safety standards or our members' expectations regarding safety, we could experience lost sales, increased costs, and legal and reputational losses. the sale of these items involves the risk of health-related illness or injury to our members. such illnesses or injuries could result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other
10
item 1a-risk factors (continued)
agents, or residues introduced during the growing, manufacturing, storage, handling and transportation phases, or faulty design. our vendors are generally contractually required to comply with applicable product safety laws, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards. while we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and work to comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations, we cannot be sure that consumption or use of our products will not cause a health-related illness or injury in the future or that we will not be subject to claims, lawsuits, or government investigations relating to such matters resulting in costly product recalls and other liabilities that could adversely affect our business and results of operations. even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential members and our corporate and brand image, and these effects could be long term.
we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services, and our market share.
it is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services our members will desire. our success depends, in part, on our ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences. failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences (including those relating to sustainability of product sources and animal welfare) and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and services and our market share. if we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases accordingly, we may have excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns and reduce our operating performance. this could have an adverse effect on gross margin (net sales less merchandise costs) and operating income.
if we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant multichannel experience for our members, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.
multichannel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing member expectations and new developments by our competitors. our members, especially younger members, are increasingly using computers, tablets, mobile phones, and other devices to shop. as part of our multichannel strategy, we are making technology investments in our websites and mobile applications. if we are unable to make, improve, or develop relevant member-facing technology in a timely manner, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected.
our inability to attract, train and retain highly qualified employees could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our success depends on the continued contributions of members of our senior management and other key operations, merchandising and administrative personnel, and the loss of these contributions could have a material adverse effect on our business. we must attract, train and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees, while controlling related labor costs and maintaining our core values. our ability to control labor and benefit costs is subject to numerous external factors, including regulatory changes, prevailing wage rates, and healthcare and other insurance costs. we compete with other retail and non-retail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them. there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
market and other external risks we face strong competition from other retailers and warehouse club operators, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
the retail business is highly competitive. we compete for customers, employees, sites, products and services and in other important respects with a wide range of local, regional and national wholesalers and retailers, both in the united states and in foreign countries, including other warehouse club operators, supermarkets,
11
item 1a-risk factors (continued)
supercenters, department and specialty stores, gasoline stations, and internet retailers. such retailers and warehouse club operators compete in a variety of ways, including merchandise pricing, selection and availability, services, location, convenience, and store hours. the evolution of retailing in online and mobile channels has improved the ability of customers to comparison shop with digital devices, which has enhanced competition. some competitors may have greater financial resources, better access to merchandise and greater market penetration than we do. our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures, changes in the retail markets and member expectations could result in lost market share and negatively affect our financial results.
general economic factors, domestically and internationally, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
higher energy and gasoline costs, inflation, levels of unemployment, healthcare costs, consumer debt levels, foreign currency exchange rates, unsettled financial markets, weaknesses in housing and real estate markets, reduced consumer confidence, changes related to government fiscal and tax policies, sovereign debt crises, and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services or require a change in the mix of products we sell. prices of certain commodity products, including gasoline and other food products, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations, taxes and periodic delays in delivery. rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect our sales and profit margins. these factors could also increase our merchandise costs and selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results. general economic conditions can also be affected by the outbreak of war, acts of terrorism, or other significant national or international events.
vendors may be unable to supply us with quality merchandise at the right prices in a timely manner or may fail to adhere to our high standards resulting in adverse effects on our business, merchandise inventories, sales, and profit margins.
we depend heavily on our ability to purchase merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. as these quantities continue to grow, we have no assurances of continued supply, pricing or access to new products, and any vendor could at any time change the terms upon which it sells to us or discontinue selling to us. member demands may lead to out-of-stock positions of our merchandise leading to loss of sales and profits.
we purchase our merchandise from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers and have thousands of vendor relationships. our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of key vendors could negatively affect us. we may not be able to develop relationships with new vendors, and products from alternative sources, if any, may be of a lesser quality or more expensive than those from existing vendors. because of our efforts to adhere to high quality standards for which available supply may be limited, particularly for certain food items, the large volume we demand may not be consistently available.
our suppliers (and those they depend upon for materials and services) are subject to risks, including labor disputes, union organizing activities, financial liquidity, inclement weather, natural disasters, supply constraints, and general economic and political conditions that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable merchandise. for these or other reasons, one or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our quality control, legal, regulatory or animal welfare standards. these deficiencies may delay or preclude delivery of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members. this failure could lead to litigation and recalls, which could damage our reputation and our brands, increase our costs, and otherwise adversely impact our business.
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.
during 2015, our international operations, including canada, generated 27% and 36% of our net sales and operating income, respectively. our international operations have accounted for an increasingly larger portion of our warehouses and we plan to continue expanding our international operations. our operations in
12
item 1a-risk factors (continued)
countries other than the u.s. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries. our consolidated financial statements are denominated in u.s. dollars, and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the results of operations of our international operations from local currencies into u.s. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. as a result of such translations, future fluctuations in currency exchange rates over time that are unfavorable to us may adversely affect the financial performance of our canadian and other international operating segments and have a corresponding adverse period-over-period effect on our results of operations. as we continue to expand our international operations, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may increase.
we may pay for products we purchase for sale in our warehouses around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold. currency fluctuations may increase our cost of goods and may not be passed on to members. consequently, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.
natural disasters or other catastrophic events could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
natural disasters, such as hurricanes, typhoons or earthquakes, particularly in california or in washington state, where our centralized operating systems and administrative personnel are located, could negatively affect our operations and financial performance. such events could result in physical damage to one or more of our properties, the temporary closure of one or more warehouses or depots, the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local or overseas suppliers, the temporary disruption in the transport of goods to or from overseas, delays in the delivery of goods to our warehouses or depots within the countries in which we operate, and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our warehouses. public health issues, whether occurring in the u.s. or abroad, could disrupt our operations, disrupt the operations of suppliers or members, or have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels. these events could also reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to receive products from suppliers. we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
factors associated with climate change could adversely affect our business.
we use natural gas, diesel fuel, gasoline, and electricity in our distribution and warehouse operations. increased u.s. and foreign government and agency regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may result in increased compliance costs and legislation or regulation affecting energy inputs that could materially affect our profitability. in addition, climate change could affect our ability to procure needed commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience. we also sell a substantial amount of gasoline, the demand for which could be impacted by concerns about climate change and which also could face increased regulation. climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions, such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes, and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels. extreme weather conditions increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured.
failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.
we believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our comparable warehouse sales growth rates, gross margin, earnings and earnings per share or new warehouse openings could cause the market price of our stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase policies.
13
item 1a-risk factors (continued)
legal and regulatory risks our international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, accounting, regulatory, political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
during 2015, we operated 206 warehouses in eight countries outside of the u.s. and we plan to continue expanding our international operations. future operating results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, many similar to those we face in the u.s., certain of which are beyond our control. these factors include political conditions, economic conditions, regulatory constraints, currency regulations, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future. other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies and the laws and regulations of the u.s. and foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having major facilities located in countries which have been historically less stable than the u.s. risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences, and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights.
changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations.
accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations we apply to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, including, but not limited to, revenue recognition, merchandise inventories, vendor rebates and other vendor consideration, impairment of long-lived assets, self-insurance liabilities, and income taxes are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management. changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance.
provisions for losses related to self-insured risks are generally based upon independent actuarially determined estimates. the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses can be highly unpredictable, which can affect the liability recorded for such claims. for example, variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized. similarly, changes in legal trends and interpretations, as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can impact ultimate costs. although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables, any changes could have a considerable effect upon future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities and could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.
we could be subject to additional income tax liabilities.
we compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate. as the tax rates vary among countries, a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision. additionally, changes in the enacted tax rates, adverse outcomes in connection with income tax audits in any jurisdiction, including transfer pricing disputes, or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
significant changes in, or failure to comply with, federal, state, regional, local and international laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and other environmental matters could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we are subject to a wide variety of federal, state, regional, local and international laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, hazardous and non-hazardous wastes and other environmental matters. any failure to comply with these laws could result in significant costs to satisfy environmental compliance, remediation or compensatory requirements, or the imposition of
14
item 1a-risk factors (continued)
severe penalties or restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits and some of these outcomes could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
our business requires compliance with many laws and regulations. failure to achieve compliance could subject us to lawsuits and other proceedings, and lead to damage awards, fines, penalties, and remediation costs. we are, or may become involved, in a number of legal proceedings and audits including grand jury investigations, government and agency investigations, and consumer, employment, tort, unclaimed property laws, and other litigation (see discussion of legal proceedings in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report). we cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies, including environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by governmental authorities. the outcome of some of these legal proceedings, audits, unclaimed property laws, and other contingencies could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions which could negatively affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations. additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management's attention and resources.
item 7-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (amounts in millions, except per share, share, membership fee, and warehouse count data)
overview we believe that the most important driver of our profitability is sales growth, particularly comparable warehouse sales (comparable sales) growth. we define comparable sales as sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, as well as online sales related to websites operating for more than one year. comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations); and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions (primarily impacting our u.s. and canadian operations). the higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage certain of our selling, general and administrative expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long term. another substantial factor in sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, especially the united states. sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers. while we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private label items.
our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at the most competitive prices. we do not focus in the short term on maximizing prices charged, but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our "pricing authority" - consistently providing the most competitive values. our investments in merchandise pricing can, from time to time, include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting near-term gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage). we believe that our gasoline business draws members but it generally has a significantly lower gross margin percentage relative to our non-gasoline business. a higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage. rapidly changing gasoline prices may significantly impact our near-term net sales growth. generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales. a decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect.
we also achieve sales growth by opening new warehouses. as our warehouse base grows, available and desirable potential sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. the negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are increasingly less significant relative to the results of our total operations. our rate of square footage growth is higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. our online business growth both domestically and internationally has also increased our sales.
our membership format is an integral part of our business model and has a significant effect on our profitability. this format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. the extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase penetration of our executive members, and sustain high renewal rates, materially influences our profitability.
our financial performance depends heavily on our ability to control costs. while we believe that we have achieved successes in this area historically, some significant costs are partially outside our control, most particularly health care and utility expenses. with respect to expenses relating to the compensation of our
19
item 7-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (amounts in millions, except per share, share, membership fee, and warehouse count data) (continued)
employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize the wages and benefits that they earn. rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. this may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. because our business is operated on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the income statement, particularly gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income.
our operating model is generally the same across our u.s., canada, and other international operating segments (see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report). certain countries in the other international segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth, lower wages and benefit costs as a percentage of country sales, and/or less or no direct membership warehouse competition. additionally, we operate our lower-margin gasoline business in the u.s., canada, australia, u.k., and japan.
in discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar, which are references to the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into u.s. dollars for financial reporting purposes. this impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior-year period's currency exchange rates. we also refer to the impact of changes in gasoline prices on our net sales. this impact is calculated based on the difference between the current period's average gasoline price per gallon sold and the comparable prior-year period's average gasoline price per gallon sold.
our fiscal year ends on the sunday closest to august 31. fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 were 52-week fiscal years ending on august 30, 2015, august 31, 2014 and september 1, 2013, respectively. certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to costco.
highlights for fiscal year 2015 included:
•   we opened 23 net new warehouses in 2015, 12 in the u.s., one in canada, and 10 in our other international segment, compared to 29 net new warehouses in 2014;
•   net sales increased 3% to $113,666, driven by sales at new warehouses opened in 2014 and 2015, and a 1% increase in comparable sales. net and comparable sales results were negatively impacted by changes in all foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar and decreases in the price of gasoline;
•   membership fee revenue increased 4% to $2,533, primarily due to membership sign-ups at existing and new warehouses and executive membership upgrades, partially offset by the negative impact of changes in all foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar;
•   gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased 43 basis points, primarily from the impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales as well as higher gross margins in our gasoline business;
•   selling, general and administrative (sg&amp;a) expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 18 basis points;
•   net income increased to $2,377, or $5.37 per diluted share compared to $2,058, or $4.65 per diluted share in 2014. the current year results were positively impacted by a $57 tax benefit, or $0.13 per diluted share, in connection with the special cash dividend paid to the company's 401(k) plan participants;
•   changes in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar adversely impacted diluted earnings per share by $0.28, primarily due to changes in the canadian dollar;
•   in february 2015, we issued $1,000 in aggregate principal amount of senior notes, which partially funded a special cash dividend of $5.00 per share paid in february 2015 (approximately $2,201); and
•   the board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.355 to $0.40 per share in april 2015.

2015 vs. 2014
net sales net sales increased $3,454 or 3% during 2015. this was attributable to sales at new warehouses opened in 2014 and 2015 and a 1% increase in comparable warehouse sales. changes in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar negatively impacted net sales by approximately $3,344, or 303 basis points, compared to 2014. the negative impact was attributable to all foreign countries in which we operate, predominantly canada of $2,027, mexico of $385, and japan of $368. changes in gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by approximately $2,902, or 263 basis points, due to a 22% decrease in the average sales price per gallon.
comparable sales comparable sales increased 1% during 2015 and was positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency partially offset by a decrease in the average ticket. the average ticket and comparable sales results were negatively impacted by changes in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar and a decrease in gasoline prices. the increase in comparable sales also includes the negative impact of cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations).

2015 vs. 2014
membership fees increased 4% in 2015. this increase was primarily due to membership sign-ups at existing and new warehouses and increased number of upgrades to our higher-fee executive membership program. these increases were partially offset by changes in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar, which negatively impacted membership fees by approximately $76 in 2015. our member renewal rates are currently 91% in the u.s. and canada and 88% worldwide.
2014 vs. 2013
membership fees increased 6% in 2014. this increase was primarily due to membership sign-ups at existing and new warehouses and increased number of upgrades to our higher-fee executive membership program. the raising of our membership fees in fiscal 2012 positively impacted 2014 and 2013 by $9 and $119, respectively. these increases were partially offset by changes in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar, which negatively impacted membership fees by approximately $35 in 2014.

2015 vs. 2014
during 2015, the gross margin of our combined core merchandise categories (food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods), when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), increased five basis points, primarily due to increases in softlines and food and sundries, partially offset by a decrease in fresh foods. this measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses.
our gross margin percentage increased 43 basis points compared to 2014 and most of the improvement was derived from the impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales. excluding this impact, gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 10.81%, an increase of 15 basis points from the prior year. this increase is predominantly due to: an increase in our warehouse ancillary and other business gross margin of 23 basis points, due primarily to our gasoline business; partially offset by a negative contribution from core merchandise categories of 12 basis points, as a result of a decrease in their sales penetration. a lifo benefit in 2015 compared to a charge in 2014 positively contributed five basis points. the lifo benefit resulted largely from lower costs for gasoline. changes in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately $359 in 2015.
gross margin on a segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales (segment gross margin percentage), increased in our u.s. operations, primarily due to our gasoline business, food and sundries merchandise category and the lifo benefit discussed above. the segment gross margin percentage in our canadian operations decreased, primarily in hardlines and softlines. the segment gross margin percentage in our other international operations decreased, primarily in food and sundries.
2014 vs. 2013
during 2014, the gross margin of our combined core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales, increased seven basis points, primarily due to increases in our softlines and food and sundries categories, partially offset by a decrease in hardlines. fresh foods also had a positive impact as a result of higher sales penetration.
our gross margin percentage increased four basis points compared to 2013 and most of the improvement was derived from the impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales. excluding this impact, gross margin as a percentage of adjusted net sales was 10.63%, an increase of one basis point from the prior year. this increase is predominantly due to warehouse ancillary and other business gross margin of six basis points, which was largely offset by five basis points due to a lifo charge in 2014 compared to a benefit in 2013. the lifo charge resulted from higher costs for our merchandise inventories, primarily our foods and fresh foods categories. changes in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately $151 in 2014.
gross margin on a segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales, increased in our u.s. operations, primarily due to our softlines and food and sundries categories, partially offset by a decrease in hardlines and the lifo charge discussed above. the segment gross margin percentage in our canadian operations decreased, primarily due to decreases in hardlines and food and sundries, partially offset by an increase in fresh foods. the segment gross margin percentage in our other international operations increased, primarily due to fresh foods.

2015 vs. 2014
sg&a expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 18 basis points, mostly due to the negative impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales. excluding this impact, sg&a expenses as a percentage of adjusted net sales were 9.82%, an improvement of seven basis points. this was due to lower warehouse operating costs of 16 basis points, primarily from improvements in payroll expenses in our core business as a result of leveraging increased sales. this improvement was partially offset by higher central operating costs of five basis points, predominantly due to increased depreciation and service contract costs associated with our information systems modernization projects that were placed into service during the year, primarily incurred by our u.s. operations. our investment in modernizing our information systems is ongoing. higher stock compensation expense also negatively impacted our sg&a expenses by four basis points, due to an appreciation in the trading price of our stock at the time of grant. changes in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar decreased our sg&a expenses by approximately $282 in 2015.
2014 vs. 2013
sg&a expenses as a percentage of net sales increased seven basis points. excluding the effect of gasoline price deflation on net sales, sg&a expenses as a percentage of adjusted net sales were 9.86%, an increase of four basis points. this increase was largely due to an increase in central operating costs of three basis points primarily due to continued investment in modernizing our information systems, primarily incurred by our u.s. operations. stock compensation expense was also higher by two basis points due to accelerated vesting for long service and appreciation in the trading price of our stock at the time of grant, despite a 14% reduction in the average number of restricted stock units (rsus) granted to each participant. warehouse operating costs were lower by one basis point, primarily resulting from improvements in payroll in our canadian operations as a result of leveraging increased sales, partially offset by increases in employee benefit costs, primarily health care, in our u.s. operations. changes in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar decreased our sg&a expenses by $119 in 2014.

2015 vs. 2014
the increase in net foreign-currency transaction gains was primarily attributable to favorable mark-to-market adjustments for forward foreign exchange contracts compared to the prior year. see derivatives and foreign currency sections in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report. the increase was also attributable to net gains on the revaluation or settlement of monetary assets and liabilities during the year.
2014 vs. 2013
the increase in interest income in 2014 was primarily driven by higher average cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments balances, primarily in our u.s. operations. the decrease in net foreign-currency transaction gains was primarily attributable to the revaluation or settlement of monetary assets and monetary liabilities during the year, primarily our japanese subsidiary's u.s. dollar-denominated payables.

our provision for income taxes in 2015 and 2013 were favorably impacted by net tax benefits of $68 and $77, respectively, primarily due to tax benefits recorded in connection with special cash dividends paid to employees through our 401(k) retirement plan. dividends paid on these shares are deductible for u.s. income tax purposes. there was no similar special cash dividend in 2014.

our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment balances. cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $6,419 and $7,315 at the end of 2015 and 2014, respectively. of these balances, approximately $1,243 and $1,383 at the end of 2015 and 2014, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to sales in the last week of our fiscal year. cash and cash equivalents were negatively impacted by changes in exchange rates by $418 and $11, respectively.
we have not provided for u.s. deferred taxes on cumulative undistributed earnings of certain non-u.s. consolidated subsidiaries because our subsidiaries have invested or will invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely, or the earnings if repatriated would not result in a deferred tax liability. this includes the remaining undistributed earnings of our canadian operations that management maintains are indefinitely reinvested, or could be repatriated without resulting in a deferred tax liability. deferred taxes are recorded for earnings of our foreign operations when we determine that such earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested.
during 2015, we repatriated a portion of the earnings in our canadian operations that in 2014 were no longer considered indefinitely reinvested. in the fourth quarter of 2015, we changed our position regarding an additional portion of the undistributed earnings of our canadian operations, which are no longer considered indefinitely reinvested. current exchange rates compared to historical rates when these earnings were generated resulted in an immaterial u.s. tax benefit, which was recorded at the end of 2015.
management believes that our cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. we believe that our u.s. current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet our u.s. liquidity requirements and have no current plans to repatriate for use in the u.s. cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held by these non-u.s. consolidated subsidiaries whose earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested. cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held at these subsidiaries and considered to be indefinitely reinvested totaled $1,196 at august 30, 2015.
cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities totaled $4,285 in 2015 compared to $3,984 in 2014. our cash flow provided by operations is primarily derived from net sales and membership fees. our cash flow used in operations generally consists of payments to our merchandise vendors, warehouse operating costs including payroll and employee benefits, credit card processing fees, and utilities. cash used in operations also includes payments for income taxes. the increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2015 when compared to 2014 was primarily due to stronger earnings.
cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities totaled $2,480 in 2015 compared to $2,093 in 2014. our cash flow used in investing activities is primarily related to funding our warehouse expansion and remodeling activities. net cash flows from investing activities also includes purchases and maturities of short-term investments.
capital expenditure plans we opened 23 new warehouses, relocated two warehouses, and converted an existing warehouse to a business center in 2015 and plan to open up to 32 new warehouses in 2016 and relocate up to five

warehouses. our primary requirement for capital is acquiring land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses. to a lesser extent, capital is required for initial warehouse operations, the modernization of our information systems, and working capital. in 2015 we spent $2,393 on capital expenditures, and it is our current intention to spend approximately $2,800 to $3,000 during fiscal 2016. these expenditures are expected to be financed with cash from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs.
cash flows from financing activities net cash used in financing activities totaled $2,324 in 2015 compared to $786 in 2014. the primary uses of cash in 2015 were dividend payments of $2,865, which includes a $5.00 per share special cash dividend, repurchases of common stock, and payment of withholding taxes on stock-based awards. net cash used in financing activities was partially offset by the issuance of $1,000 in senior notes.
in february 2015, we issued $1,000 in aggregate principal amount of senior notes as follows: $500 of 1.75% senior notes due february 15, 2020, and $500 of 2.25% senior notes due february 15, 2022. the proceeds were used to pay a portion of the special cash dividend on february 27, 2015.
stock repurchase programs in april 2015, our board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program in the amount of $4,000, which expires in april 2019. this authorization revoked previously authorized but unused amounts, totaling $2,528. during 2015 and 2014, we repurchased 3,456,000 and 2,915,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $142.87 and $114.45, totaling approximately $494 and $334, respectively. the remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $3,699 at the end of 2015. purchases are made from time-to-time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under sec rule 10b5-1. repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the washington business corporation act.
dividends our cash dividends paid in 2015 totaled $6.51 per share, as compared to $1.33 per share in 2014. in april 2015, our board of directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.355 to $0.40 per share. additionally, in 2015, our board of directors declared and paid a special cash dividend of $5.00 per share, totaling approximately $2,201.
bank credit facilities and commercial paper programs we maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. at august 30, 2015, we had borrowing capacity within these facilities of $407, of which $337 was maintained by our international operations. of the $337, $153 is guaranteed by the company. there were no outstanding short-term borrowings under the bank credit facilities at the end of 2015 and 2014.
the company has letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $149. the outstanding commitments under these facilities at the end of 2015 totaled $90, including $89 in standby letters of credit with expiration dates within one year. the bank credit facilities have various expiration dates, all within one year, and we generally intend to renew these facilities prior to their expiration. the amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit then outstanding.

off-balance sheet arrangements we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that in the opinion of management have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap) requires that we make estimates and judgments including those related to revenue recognition, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long-lived assets, insurance/self-insurance liabilities, and income taxes. we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable and we continue to review and evaluate these statements. for further information on significant accounting policies, see discussion in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report.
revenue recognition we generally recognize sales, which include shipping fees where applicable, net of returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. when we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount is generally recorded as deferred sales in the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. we provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends and reduce sales and merchandise costs

accordingly. our sales returns reserve is based on an estimate of the net realizable value of merchandise inventories to be returned. amounts collected from members for sales and value added taxes are recorded on a net basis.
we evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or a net amount. generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. if we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record a net amount, which is reflected in net sales. we record related shipping fees on a gross basis.
we account for membership fee revenue, net of refunds, on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over one-year. our executive members qualify for a 2% reward on qualified purchases (up to a maximum reward of approximately $750 per year), which can be redeemed only at costco warehouses. we account for this reward as a reduction in sales. the sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non-redemptions based on historical data.
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method, and are stated using the last-in, first-out (lifo) method for substantially all u.s. merchandise inventories. we record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the estimated effect of inflation or deflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. we believe the lifo method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method and are stated using the first-in, first-out (fifo) method.
we provide for estimated inventory losses (shrink) between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. the provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year.
inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches.
impairment of long-lived assets we evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment on an annual basis, when relocating or closing a facility, or when events or changes in circumstances occur that may indicate the carrying amount of the asset group, generally an individual warehouse, may not be fully recoverable. our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then-current fair value.
insurance/self-insurance liabilities we use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including for certain risks, a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and participation in a reinsurance program, to provide for potential liabilities for workers' compensation, general liability, property damage, directors' and officers' liability, vehicle liability, and employee health care benefits. liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends.
income taxes the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. significant judgment is required in assessing the
29
item 7-management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (amounts in millions, except per share, share, membership fee, and warehouse count data) (continued)
timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. the benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. additionally, certain of our cumulative foreign undistributed earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested. these earnings would be subject to u.s. income tax if we changed our position and could result in a u.s. deferred tax liability. when facts and circumstances change, we reassess these positions and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate.

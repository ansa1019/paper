item 1a. risk factors you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10-k, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. the risks described below are not the only risks facing us. risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
risks related to our business and our industry our business and operations have experienced rapid growth, and if we do not appropriately manage any future growth or are unable to improve our systems and processes, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will be adversely affected.
we have experienced rapid growth and increased demand for our products over the last several years, which has placed a strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. our employee headcount and number of end customers have increased significantly. to handle the increase in end customers, we expect to continue to grow our headcount significantly over the next 12 months. for example, as of december 31, 2011 and december 31, 2015, our cumulative number of end customers increased from approximately 1,100 to over 3,700. as we have grown, we have had to manage an increasingly larger and more complex array of internal systems and processes to scale with all aspects of our business, including our hardware and software development, contract manufacturing and purchasing, logistics and fulfillment and maintenance and support. our success will depend in part upon our ability to manage our growth effectively. to do so, we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and continue to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. to manage domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting processes and procedures and implement more extensive and integrated financial and business information systems. we may not be able to successfully implement these or other improvements to our systems and processes in an efficient or timely manner, and we may discover deficiencies in their capabilities or effectiveness. we may experience difficulties in managing improvements to our systems and processes or in connection with third-party technology. in addition, our systems and processes may not prevent or detect all errors, omissions or fraud. our failure to improve our systems and processes, or their failure to operate effectively and in the intended manner, may result in disruption of our current operations and end-customer relationships, our inability to manage the growth of our business and our inability to accurately forecast our revenue, expenses and earnings and prevent certain losses.
our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects and may increase the risk associated with your investment.
we were founded in 2004 and shipped our first products in 2008. the majority of our revenue growth has occurred since the beginning of 2010. our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and our future prospects, including our ability to plan for and model future growth. we have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by rapidly growing companies in constantly evolving industries, including the risks described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. if we do not address these risks successfully, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will be adversely affected, and the market price of our common stock could decline. further, we have limited historical financial data, and we operate in a rapidly evolving market. as such, any predictions about our future revenue and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history or operated in a more predictable market.
our results of operations are likely to vary significantly from period to period and be unpredictable and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors or our previously issued financial guidance, or if any forward-looking financial guidance does not meet the expectation of analysts or investors, the market price of our common stock could decline substantially our results of operations have historically varied from period to period, and we expect that this trend will continue. as a result, you should not rely upon our past financial results for any period as indicators of future performance. our results of operations in any given period can be influenced by a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict, including:
•   our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customer and attract new end customers, including large end customers;
•   the budgeting cycles and purchasing practices of end customers, including large end customers who may receive lower pricing terms due to volume discounts;
•   the buying patterns of our large end customers in which large bulk purchases may or may not occur in certain quarters;
•   the cost and potential outcomes of existing and future litigation, including cisco and optumsoft litigation matters;
•   the rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force;
•   changes in our pricing policies, whether initiated by us or as a result of competition;
•   the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operation and expansion of our business;
•   changes in end-customer, distributor or reseller requirements or market needs;
•   deferral or cancellation of orders from end customers, including in anticipation of new products or product enhancements announced by us or our competitors, or warranty returns;
•   the inclusion of any acceptance provisions in our customer contracts or any delays in acceptance of those products;
15
•   changes in the growth rate of the networking market;
•   the actual or rumored timing and success of new product and service introductions by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive landscape of our industry, including consolidation among our competitors or end customers;
•   our ability to successfully expand our business domestically and internationally;
•   our ability to increase the size of our distribution channel;
•   decisions by potential end customers to purchase cloud networking solutions from larger, more established vendors, white box vendors or their primary network equipment vendors;
•   price competition;
•   insolvency or credit difficulties confronting our end customers, which could adversely affect their ability to purchase or pay for our products and services, or confronting our key suppliers, including our sole source suppliers, which could disrupt our supply chain;
•   any disruption in our sales channel or termination of our relationship with important channel partners;
•   our inability to fulfill our end customers' orders due to supply chain delays, access to key commodities or technologies or events that impact our manufacturers or their suppliers;
•   seasonality or cyclical fluctuations in our markets;
•   future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies;
•   stock-based compensation expense;
•   our overall effective tax rate, including impacts caused by any reorganization in our corporate structure, any changes in our valuation allowance for domestic deferred tax assets and any new legislation or regulatory developments;
•   increases or decreases in our expenses caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as an increasing portion of our expenses are incurred and paid in currencies other than the u.s. dollar;
•   general economic conditions, both domestically and in foreign markets; and
•   other risk factors described in this annual report on form 10-k.
any one of the factors above or the cumulative effect of several of the factors described above may result in significant fluctuations in our financial and other results of operations. this variability and unpredictability could result in our failure to meet our revenue, gross margins, results of operations or other expectations contained in any forward looking financial guidance we have issued or the expectations of securities analysts or investors for a particular period. if we fail to meet or exceed such guidance or expectations for these or any other reasons, the market price of our common stock could decline substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.
we expect large purchases by a limited number of end customers to continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenue, and any loss or delay of expected purchases could result in material quarter-to-quarter fluctuations of our revenue or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.
historically, large purchases by a relatively limited number of end customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue. many of these end customers make large purchases to complete or upgrade specific data center installations and are typically made on a purchase-order basis rather than pursuant to long-term contracts. revenue from sales to microsoft, through our channel partner, world wide technology, inc., accounted for 12.0% of our revenue for the year ended december 31, 2015, 14.9% of our revenue for the year ended december 31, 2014, and 21.9% of our revenue for the year ended december 31, 2013.
as a consequence of the concentrated nature of our customer base and their purchasing behavior, our quarterly revenue and results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to estimate. for example, any cancellation of orders or any acceleration or delay in anticipated product purchases or the acceptance of shipped products by our larger end customers could materially affect our revenue and results of operations in any quarterly period. we may be unable to sustain or increase our revenue from our large end customers or offset the discontinuation of concentrated purchases by our larger end customers with purchases by new or existing end customers. we expect that such concentrated purchases will continue to contribute materially to our revenue for the foreseeable future and that our results of operations may fluctuate materially as a result of such larger end customers' buying patterns. in addition, we may see consolidation of our customer base, such as among internet companies and cloud service providers, which could result in loss of end customers. the loss of such end customers, or a significant delay or reduction in their purchases, could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
our revenue growth rate in recent periods may not be indicative of our future performance.
our revenue growth rate in recent periods may not be indicative of our future performance. we experienced annual revenue growth rates of 43.4%, 61.7%, and 86.8% in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. we may not achieve similar revenue growth rates in future periods, especially as we enter and expand into the cloud services and application services provider markets. you should not rely on our revenue for any prior quarterly or annual period as any indication of our future revenue or revenue growth. if we are unable to maintain consistent revenue or revenue growth, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.
16
we face intense competition, especially from larger, well-established companies, and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position.
the market for data center networking, including the market for cloud networking, is intensely competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future from established competitors and new market entrants. this competition could result in increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses and our failure to increase, or the loss of, market share, any of which would likely seriously harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
the data center networking market has been historically dominated by cisco systems, with competition also coming from other large network equipment and system vendors, including juniper networks, brocade communications systems, hewlett-packard and dell. we also face competition from other companies and new market entrants, including "whitebox" switch vendors as well as current technology partners and end customers. many of our existing and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as:
•   greater name recognition and longer operating histories;
•   larger sales and marketing budgets and resources;
•   broader distribution and established relationships with channel partners and end customers;
•   greater access to larger end-customer bases;
•   greater end-customer support resources;
•   greater manufacturing resources;
•   the ability to leverage their sales efforts across a broader portfolio of products;
•   the ability to leverage purchasing power with vendor subcomponents;
•   the ability to bundle competitive offerings with other products and services;
•   the ability to develop their own silicon chips;
•   the ability to set more aggressive pricing policies;
•   lower labor and development costs;
•   greater resources to make acquisitions;
•   larger intellectual property portfolios; and
•   substantially greater financial, technical, research and development or other resources.
our competitors also may be able to provide end customers with capabilities or benefits different from or greater than those we can provide in areas such as technical qualifications or geographic presence or may be able to provide end customers a broader range of products, services and prices. in addition, large competitors may have more extensive relationships with and within existing and potential end customers that provide them with an advantage in competing for business with those end customers. for example, certain large competitors encourage end customers of their other products and services to adopt their data networking solutions through discounted bundled product packages. our ability to compete will depend upon our ability to provide a better solution than our competitors at a more competitive price. we may be required to make substantial additional investments in research, development, marketing and sales in order to respond to competition, and we cannot assure you that these investments will achieve any returns for us or that we will be able to compete successfully in the future.
we also expect increased competition if our market continues to expand. conditions in our market could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or other factors. current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties that have greater resources available than we do. our current or potential competitors might take advantage of the greater resources of the larger organization resulting from these acquisitions to compete more vigorously or broadly with us. in addition, continued industry consolidation might adversely affect end customers' perceptions of the viability of smaller and even medium-sized networking companies and, consequently, end customers' willingness to purchase from those companies. further, certain large end customers may develop network switches and cloud service solutions for internal use and/or to broaden their portfolio of products, which could allow these end customers to become new competitors in the market.
17
if we do not successfully anticipate technological shifts, market needs and opportunities, and develop products and product enhancements that meet those technological shifts, needs and opportunities, or if those products are not made available in a timely manner or do not gain market acceptance, we may not be able to compete effectively, and our ability to generate revenue will suffer.
the cloud networking market can be characterized by rapid technological shifts and increasingly complex end-customer requirements to achieve scalable and more programmable networks that facilitate virtualization, big data, public/private cloud and web scale computing. we must continue to develop new technologies and products that address emerging technological trends and changing end-customer needs. the process of developing new technology is complex and uncertain, and new offerings requires significant upfront investment that may not result in material design improvements to existing products or result in marketable new products or costs savings or revenue for an extended period of time, if at all. the success of new products depends on several factors, including appropriate new product definition, component costs, timely completion and introduction of these products, differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products.
in addition, new technologies could render our existing products obsolete or less attractive to end customers, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected if such technologies are widely adopted. for example, end customers may prefer to address their network switch requirements by licensing software operating systems separately and placing them on industry-standard servers or develop their own networking products rather than purchasing integrated hardware products as has occurred in the server industry.
we may not be able to successfully anticipate or adapt to changing technology or end-customer requirements on a timely basis, or at all. if we fail to keep up with technology changes or to convince our end customers and potential end customers of the value of our solutions even in light of new technologies, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.
we are currently involved in litigation with cisco systems, inc.
on december 5, 2014, cisco filed two complaints against us in district court for the northern district of california, which are proceeding as case no. 4:14-cv-05343 ("'43 case") and case no. 5:14-cv-05344 ("'44 case"). in the '43 case, cisco alleges that we infringe u.s. patent nos. 6,377,577; 6,741,592; 7,023,853; 7,061,875; 7,162,537; 7,200,145; 7,224,668; 7,290,164; 7,340,597; 7,460,492; 8,051,211; and 8,356,296 (respectively, "the '577 patent," "the '592 patent," "the '853 patent," "the 875 patent," "the '537 patent," "the '145 patent," "the '668 patent," "the '164 patent," "the '597 patent," "the '492 patent," "the '211 patent," and "the '296 patent"). cisco seeks, as relief for our alleged infringement in the '43 case, lost profits and/or reasonable royalty damages in an unspecified amount, including treble damages, attorney's fees, and associated costs. cisco also seeks injunctive relief in the '43 case. on february 10, 2015, the court granted our unopposed motion to stay the '43 case until the proceedings before the united states international trade commission ("usitc") pertaining to the same patents (as discussed below) become final. in the '44 case, cisco's complaint alleges that we infringe u.s. patent nos. 7,047,526 and 7,953,886 (respectively, "the '526 patent" and "the '886 patent"), and further alleges that we infringe numerous copyrights pertaining to cisco's "command line interface" or "cli." as relief for our alleged patent infringement in the '44 case, cisco seeks lost profits and/or reasonable royalty damages in an unspecified amount including treble damages, attorney's fees, and associated costs as well as injunctive relief. as relief for our alleged copyright infringement, cisco seeks damages in an unspecified amount in the form of alleged lost profits, profits from our alleged infringement, statutory damages, attorney's fees and associated costs. cisco also seeks injunctive relief against our alleged copyright infringement. on february 13, 2015, we answered the complaint in the '44 case, denying the patent and copyright infringement allegations and also raising numerous affirmative defenses. on march 6, 2015, cisco filed an amended complaint against us the '44 case. in response, we moved to dismiss cisco's allegations of willful patent infringement pre-suit indirect patent infringement. the court granted the motion with leave to amend on july 2, 2015. on july 23, 2015, cisco filed an amended complaint. on january 25, 2016, we sought leave to file counterclaims against cisco in the '44 case for antitrust and unfair competition. trial has been set for november 21, 2016 in the '44 case. trial has not been scheduled in the '43 case.
on december 19, 2014, cisco filed two complaints against us in the usitc, alleging that arista has violated section 337 of the tariff act of 1930, as amended. the complaints have been instituted as itc inv. nos. 337-ta-944 ("944 investigation") and 337-ta-945 ("945 investigation"). in the 944 investigation, cisco initially alleged that certain arista switching products infringe the '592, '537, '145, '164, '597, and '296 patents. cisco has subsequently dropped the '296 patent from the 944 investigation. in the 945 investigation, cisco alleges that certain arista switching products infringe the '577, '853, '875, '668, '492, and '211 patents. in both the 944 and 945 investigations, cisco seeks, among other things, a limited exclusion order barring entry into the united states of accused switch products (including 7000 series of switches) and a cease and desist order against us restricting our activities with respect to our imported accused switch products. on february 11, 2015, we responded to the notices of investigation and complaints in the 944 and 945 investigations by, among other things, denying the patent infringement allegations and raising numerous affirmative defenses.
the administrative law judge assigned to the 944 investigation issued a procedural schedule calling for, among other events: an evidentiary hearing on sept. 9-11 & 15-17, 2015; issuance of an initial determination regarding our alleged violations on january 27, 2016; and the target date for completion on may 27, 2016. on january 27, 2016 the administrative law judge issued a revised procedural schedule extending the date for issuance an initial determination to february 2, 2016 and the target date to june 2, 2016. the final determination in the 944 investigation is then subject to presidential review. the hearing has been completed and all post trial briefs have
18
been submitted to the usitc. on february 2, 2016, the administrative law judge issued his initial determination finding a violation of section 337 of the tariff act. more specifically, it was found that a violation has occurred in the importation into the united states, the sale for importation, or the sale within the united states after importation, of certain network devices, related software, and components thereof that the alj found infringe asserted claims 1, 2, 8-11, and 17-19 of the '537 patent; asserted claims 6, 7, 20, and 21 of the '592 patent; and asserted claims 5, 7, 45, and 46 of the '145 patent. a violation of section 337 was not found with respect to any asserted claims of the '597 and '164 patents. on february 17, 2016, we filed a request for the commission to review certain issues, including the infringement findings in the initial determination, and the commission must decide whether to grant the review no later than 60 days from the date of the initial determination (february 2, 2016).
the administrative law judge assigned to the 945 investigation issued a procedural schedule calling for, among other events: an evidentiary hearing on november 9-20, 2015; issuance of an initial determination regarding our alleged violations on april 26, 2016; and the target date for completion on august 26, 2016. the evidentiary hearing was conducted in november 2015 and all post-hearing briefing has been completed. we are awaiting the initial determination from the administrative law judge. the initial determination will be subject to review by the commission, which will then issue a final determination and any remedial orders on august 26, 2016. if the final determination finds a violation, it will be subject to presidential review.
on april 1, 2015, we filed petitions for inter partes review with the united states patent trial and appeal board ("ptab") seeking to invalidate cisco's '597, '211, and '668 patents.  on april 10, 2015, we filed petitions for inter partes review with the ptab seeking to invalidate cisco's '853 and '577 patents.  on april 16, 2015, we filed additional petitions for inter partes review with the ptab seeking to invalidate cisco's '853 and '577 patents.  on august 11, 2015, we filed a second petition for inter partes review of cisco's '668 patent.  on october 6, 2015 we filed a second petition for inter partes review of cisco's '211 patent.  on october 6, 2015, the ptab granted our petition for inter partes review of cisco's '597 patent and our first petition for inter partes review of cisco's '211 patents, but denied one of our petitions for inter partes review of cisco's '668 patent. on october 19, 2015 and october 22, 2015, the ptab denied four petitions relating to the '853 and '577 patents. on november 18, 2015, we filed a request for rehearing on one of the denied petitions related to the '577 patent and we are awaiting a decision on the request.  on december 9, 2015, we filed a petition for inter partes review with the ptab seeking to invalidate cisco's '537 patent, and additional petitions for inter partes review with the ptab seeking to invalidate cisco's '853, '577, and '668 patents.  on february 16, 2016, the ptab denied our second petition for inter partes review of the '668 patent. we are awaiting decisions by the ptab on our remaining petitions for inter partes review of the '537, '853, '577, and '668 patents.  for those petitions that the ptab grants, the ptab must issue its final written decision on validity within twelve months of its institution decision.
we intend to vigorously defend against cisco's lawsuits, as summarized in the preceding paragraphs. whether or not we prevail in the lawsuit, we expect that the litigation will be expensive, time-consuming and a distraction to management in operating our business. moreover, we cannot be certain that any claims by cisco would be resolved in our favor regardless of the merit of the claims. for example, an adverse litigation ruling could result in a significant damages award against us, could further result in the above described injunctive relief, could result in a requirement that we make substantial royalty payments to cisco, and/or could require that we modify our products to the extent that we are found to infringe any valid claims asserted against us cisco. any such adverse ruling could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operation and financial condition.
in particular, with respect to the 944 and 945 investigations, if our products are found to infringe any patents that are the subject of those investigations, the usitc would likely issue a limited exclusion order barring entry into the united states of our products (including 7000 series of switches) and a cease and desist order restricting our activities with respect to our imported products. if we become subject to a limited exclusion order and it is not disapproved by the us trade representative, we will need to remove features or develop technical design-arounds in order to take the products outside of the scope of any patent found to have been infringed and the subject of a violation. we may not be successful in developing technical design-arounds that do not infringe the patents or that are acceptable to our customers. our development efforts could be extremely costly and time consuming as well as disruptive to our other development activities and distracting to management. moreover, we may seek to obtain clearance for any such technical design-arounds from u.s. customs and border patrol ("cbp") in order to continue the importation of our products, and we may be unable to do so in a timely manner, if at all. in the case that we attempt to change our manufacturing, importation processes and shipping workflows to comply with any limited exclusion order or cease and desist order, such changes may be extremely costly, time consuming and we may not be able to implement such changes successfully. any failure to develop effective technical design-arounds, obtain timely clearance of such technical design-arounds or successfully change our manufacturing, importation processes or shipping workflows may cause a disruption in our shipments and impact our revenues, business and reputation.
in the event that the usitc issues a limited exclusion order and cease and desist order, cisco may also seek to enforce any limited exclusion order or cease and desist order by filing for an enforcement action at the usitc. in such a proceeding, we would need to demonstrate that our technical design-arounds render our products non-infringing or otherwise outside the scope of the limited exclusion order or cease and desist order. if we are unable to do so then any product shipments after the effective date of the limited exclusion order or cease and desist order (whether from existing imported inventory or from products assembled from foreign sourced components) could be subject to significant civil penalties, potential seizure of that inventory which was found to have an ineffective technical design-around, and an injunction from importing further products until we implement additional technical design-arounds.
19
additionally, the existence of this lawsuit could cause concern among our customers and partners and could adversely affect our business and results of operations. many of our customers and partners require us to indemnify and defend them against third party infringement claims and pay damages in the case of adverse rulings. these claims could harm our relationships with our customers or channel partners and might deter them from doing business with us. from time to time, we may also be required to provide additional assurances beyond our standard terms. whether or not we prevail in the lawsuit, our satisfaction of these obligations may be expensive, time-consuming and a distraction to management in operating our business.
we are currently involved in a license dispute with optumsoft, inc.
on april 4, 2014, optumsoft filed a lawsuit against us in the superior court of california, santa clara county titled optumsoft, inc. v. arista networks, inc., in which it asserts (i) ownership of certain components of our eos network operating system pursuant to the terms of a 2004 agreement between the companies and (ii) breaches of certain confidentiality and use restrictions in that agreement. under the terms of the 2004 agreement, optumsoft provided us with a non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free license to software delivered by optumsoft comprising a software tool used to develop certain components of eos and a runtime library that is incorporated into eos. the 2004 agreement places certain restrictions on our use and disclosure of the optumsoft software and gives optumsoft ownership of improvements, modifications and corrections to, and derivative works of, the optumsoft software that we develop.
in its lawsuit, optumsoft has asked the court to order us to (i) give optumsoft copies of certain components of our software for evaluation by optumsoft, (ii) cease all conduct constituting the alleged confidentiality and use restriction breaches, (iii) secure the return or deletion of optumsoft's alleged intellectual property provided to third parties, including our customers, (iv) assign ownership to optumsoft of optumsoft's alleged intellectual property currently owned by us, and (v) pay optumsoft's alleged damages, attorney's fees, and costs of the lawsuit. david cheriton, one of our founders and a former member of our board of directors who resigned from our board of directors on march 1, 2014 and has no continuing role with us, is a founder and, we believe, the largest stockholder and director of optumsoft. the 2010 david r. cheriton irrevocable trust dtd july 27, 2010, a trust for the benefit of the minor children of mr. cheriton, is one of our largest stockholders.
optumsoft has identified in confidential documents certain software components it claims to own, which are generally applicable tools and utility subroutines and not networking specific code. we cannot assure which software components optumsoft may ultimately claim to own in the litigation or whether such claimed components are material.
on april 14, 2014, we filed a cross-complaint against optumsoft, in which we assert our ownership of the software components at issue and our interpretation of the 2004 agreement. among other things, we assert that the language of the 2004 agreement and the parties' long course of conduct support our ownership of the disputed software components. we asked the court to declare our ownership of those software components, all similarly-situated software components developed in the future and all related intellectual property. we also assert that, even if we are found not to own any particular components at issue, such components are licensed to us under the terms of the 2004 agreement. however, there can be no assurance that our assertions will ultimately prevail in litigation. on the same day, we also filed an answer to optumsoft's claims, as well as affirmative defenses based in part on optumsoft's failure to maintain the confidentiality of its claimed trade secrets, its authorization of the disclosures it asserts and its delay in claiming ownership of the software components at issue. we have also taken additional steps to respond to optumsoft's allegations that we improperly used and/or disclosed optumsoft confidential information. while we believe we have meritorious defenses to these allegations, we believe we have (i) revised our software to remove the elements we understand to be the subject of the claims relating to improper use and disclosure of optumsoft confidential information and made the revised software available to our customers and (ii) removed information from our website that optumsoft asserted disclosed optumsoft confidential information.
the parties tried the case for phase i of the proceedings, relating to contract interpretation and application of the contract to certain claimed source code in september 2015. on december 16, 2015, the court issued a proposed statement of decision following phase 1 trial. in that proposed statement, the court agreed with and adopted our interpretation of the 2004 agreement, and held that we, and not optumsoft, own all of the software that was put at issue in phase 1. on january 8, 2016, optumsoft filed its objections to the court's proposed statement of decision. the court has not ruled on those objections to date, and we anticipate a ruling in the first calendar quarter of 2016. the remaining issues that were not addressed in the phase i trial are currently scheduled to be tried in april 2016.
we intend to vigorously defend against optumsoft's lawsuit. however, we cannot be certain that, if litigated, any claims by optumsoft would be resolved in our favor. for example, if it were determined that optumsoft owned components of our eos network operating system, we would be required to transfer ownership of those components and any related intellectual property to optumsoft. if optumsoft were the owner of those components, it could make them available to our competitors, such as through a sale or license. in addition, optumsoft could assert additional or different claims against us, including claims that our license from optumsoft is invalid.
additionally, the existence of this lawsuit could cause concern among our customers and potential customers and could adversely affect our business and results of operations. an adverse litigation ruling could also result in a significant damages award against us and the injunctive relief described above. in addition, if our license was ruled to have been terminated, and we were not able to negotiate a new license from optumsoft on reasonable terms, we could be required to pay substantial royalties to optumsoft or be prohibited from selling products that incorporate optumsoft intellectual property. any such adverse ruling could materially adversely
20
affect our business, prospects, results of operation and financial condition. whether or not we prevail in the lawsuit, we expect that the litigation will be expensive, time-consuming and a distraction to management in operating our business.
if we do not successfully anticipate technological shifts, market needs and opportunities, and develop products and product enhancements that meet those technological shifts, needs and opportunities, or if those products are not made available in a timely manner or do not gain market acceptance, we may not be able to compete effectively, and our ability to generate revenue will suffer.
the cloud networking market can be characterized by rapid technological shifts and increasingly complex end-customer requirements to achieve scalable and more programmable networks that facilitate virtualization, big data, public/private cloud and web scale computing. we must continue to develop new technologies and products that address emerging technological trends and changing end-customer needs. the process of developing new technology is complex and uncertain, and new offerings requires significant upfront investment that may not result in material design improvements to existing products or result in marketable new products or costs savings or revenue for an extended period of time, if at all. the success of new products depends on several factors, including appropriate new product definition, component costs, timely completion and introduction of these products, differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products.
in addition, new technologies could render our existing products obsolete or less attractive to end customers, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected if such technologies are widely adopted. for example, end customers may prefer to address their network switch requirements by licensing software operating systems separately and placing them on industry-standard servers or develop their own networking products rather than purchasing integrated hardware products as has occurred in the server industry.
we may not be able to successfully anticipate or adapt to changing technology or end-customer requirements on a timely basis, or at all. if we fail to keep up with technology changes or to convince our end customers and potential end customers of the value of our solutions even in light of new technologies, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.
product quality problems, defects, errors or vulnerabilities in our products or services could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
we produce highly complex products that incorporate advanced technologies, including both hardware and software technologies. despite testing prior to their release, our products may contain undetected defects or errors, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released. product defects or errors could affect the performance of our products and could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products. allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose revenue or market share, increase our service costs, cause us to incur substantial costs in analyzing, correcting or redesigning the products, cause us to lose significant end customers, subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks, any one of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
from time to time, we have had to replace certain components of products that we had shipped and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs, including failures in software protocols or defective component batches resulting in reliability issues, in such products, and we may be required to do so in the future. we may also be required to provide full replacements or refunds for such defective products. we cannot assure you that such remediation would not have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. please see "-our business is subject to the risks of warranty claims, product returns, product liability and product defects."
the cloud networking market is still in its early stages and is rapidly evolving. if this market does not evolve as we anticipate or our target end customers do not adopt our cloud networking solutions, we may not be able to compete effectively, and our ability to generate revenue will suffer.
the cloud networking market is still in its early stages. the market demand for cloud networking solutions has increased in recent years as end customers have deployed larger networks and have increased the use of virtualization and cloud computing. our success depends upon our ability to provide cloud networking solutions that address the needs of end customers more effectively and economically than those of other competitors or existing technologies.
if the cloud networking solutions market does not develop in the way we anticipate, if our solutions do not offer benefits compared to competing network switching products or if end customers do not recognize the benefits that our solutions provide, then our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.

the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management's attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.
as a public company, we are subject to the reporting and corporate governance requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, or the exchange act, the listing requirements of the new york stock exchange and other applicable securities rules and regulations, including the sarbanes-oxley act and the dodd-frank act. compliance with these rules and regulations and the attendant responsibilities of management and the board, may make it more difficult to attract and retain executive officers and members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, has increased our legal and financial compliance costs, made some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increased demand on our systems and resources. among other things, the exchange act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and results of operations and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. in order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. as a result, management's attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. although we have already hired additional employees to help comply with these requirements, we may need to further expand our legal and finance departments in the future, which will increase our costs and expenses.
we are also subject to the independent auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act ("section 404"), enhanced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. while we were able to determine in our management's report for fiscal 2015 that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, as well as provide an unqualified attestation report from our independent registered public accounting firm to that effect, we have and will continue to consume management resources and incur significant expenses for section 404 compliance on an ongoing basis. in the event that our chief executive officer, chief financial officer, or independent registered public accounting firm determines in the future that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under section 404, we could be subject to one or more investigations or enforcement actions by state or federal regulatory agencies, stockholder lawsuits or other adverse actions requiring us to incur defense costs, pay fines, settlements or judgments and causing investor perceptions to be adversely affected and potentially resulting in a decline in the market price of our stock.
in addition, changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, such as continued rulemaking pursuant to the dodd-frank act of 2010 and related rules and regulations regarding the disclosure of conflict minerals that are mandated by the dodd-frank act, are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. these laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. this could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. we intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expense and a diversion of management's time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. if our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business and prospects may be harmed. as a result of disclosure of information in the filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition will become more visible, which may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. if such claims are successful, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be harmed, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
in addition, as a result of our disclosure obligations as a public company, we will have reduced strategic flexibility and will be under pressure to focus on short-term results, which may adversely affect our ability to achieve long-term profitability.
if we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected.
assessing our processes, procedures and staffing in order to improve our internal control over financial reporting is an ongoing process. for the year ended december 31, 2015, management became obligated to comply for the first time with section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 and has issued a report that assesses the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
also, for the year ended december 31, 2015, an attestation report concerning the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been issued for the first time by ernst & young, llp, independent registered public accounting firm.
preparing our financial statements involves a number of complex processes, many of which are done manually and are dependent upon individual data input or review. these processes include, but are not limited to, calculating revenue, inventory costs and the preparation of our statement of cash flows.  while we continue to automate our processes and enhance our review controls to reduce the likelihood for errors, we expect that for the foreseeable future many of our processes will remain manually intensive and thus subject to human error.
22
in the past, we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. we have remediated these identified material weaknesses, but we cannot give assurance that additional material weaknesses will not be identified in the future in connection with our compliance with the provisions of section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002. the existence of one or more material weaknesses could preclude a conclusion by management that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. the existence or disclosure of any such material weakness could adversely affect our stock price.
if we are unable to attract new large end customers or to sell additional products to our existing end customers, our revenue growth will be adversely affected and our revenue could decrease.
to increase our revenue, we must add new end customers and large end customers and sell additional products to existing end customers. for example, one of our sales strategies is to target specific projects at our current end customers because they are familiar with the operational and economic benefits of our solutions, thereby reducing the sales cycle into these customers. we believe this opportunity with current end customers to be significant given their existing infrastructure and expected future spend. if we fail to attract new large end customers or sell additional products to our existing end customers, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will be harmed.
some of our large end customers require more favorable terms and conditions from their vendors and may request price concessions. as we seek to sell more products to these end customers, we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that may have an adverse effect on our business or ability to recognize revenue.
our large end customers have significant purchasing power and, as a result, may receive more favorable terms and conditions than we typically provide to other end customers, including lower prices, bundled upgrades, extended warranties, acceptance terms, indemnification terms and extended return policies and other contractual rights. as we seek to sell more products to these large end customers, an increased mix of our shipments may be subject to such terms and conditions, which may reduce our margins or affect the timing of our revenue recognition and thus may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
reliance on shipments at the end of the quarter could cause our revenue for the applicable period to fall below expected levels.
as a result of end-customer buying patterns and the efforts of our sales force and channel partners to meet or exceed their sales objectives, we have historically received a substantial portion of sales orders and generated a substantial portion of revenue during the second half of each quarter. this places significant pressure on order review and processing, supply chain management, manufacturing, inventory and quality control management, shipping and trade compliance to ensure that we have properly forecasted supply purchasing, manufacturing capacity, inventory and quality compliance and logistics. if there is any significant interruption in these critical functions, it could result in delayed order fulfillment, adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and result in a decline in the market price of our common stock.
we base our inventory requirements on our forecasts of future sales. if these forecasts are materially inaccurate, we may procure inventory that we may be unable to use in a timely manner or at all.
we and our contract manufacturers procure components and build our products based on our forecasts. these forecasts are based on estimates of future demand for our products, which are in turn based on historical trends and analyses from our sales and marketing organizations, adjusted for overall market conditions. to the extent our forecasts are materially inaccurate or if we otherwise do not need such inventory, we may under- or over-procure inventory, and such inaccuracies in our forecasts could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
managing the supply of our products and product components is complex. insufficient supply and inventory may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue, while excess inventory may harm our gross margins.
managing the supply of our products and product components is complex, and our inventory management systems and related supply-chain visibility tools may not enable us to forecast accurately and manage effectively the supply of our products and product components. furthermore, ongoing cisco litigation before the ustic and any adverse ruling that results from such litigation could cause disruption to our supply-chain or with our suppliers, which may impact our revenues, business and reputation.
insufficient supply and inventory may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue, while excess inventory may harm our gross margins. in order to reduce manufacturing lead times and plan for adequate component supply, from time to time we may issue purchase orders for components and products that are non-cancelable and non-returnable. we establish a liability for non-cancelable, non-returnable purchase commitments with our third-party contract manufacturers for quantities in excess of our demand forecasts, or obsolete material charges.
supply management remains an increased area of focus as we balance the need to maintain sufficient supply levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of obsolescence or the end of life of certain products. if we ultimately determine that we have excess supply, we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory, which in turn could result in lower gross margins. we record a provision when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or obsolete to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value.
23
alternatively, insufficient supply levels may lead to shortages that result in delayed revenue or loss of sales opportunities altogether as potential end customers turn to competitors' products that are readily available. additionally, any increases in the time required to manufacture our products or ship products could result in supply shortfalls. if we are unable to effectively manage our supply and inventory, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected.
because some of the key components in our products come from sole limited sources of supply, we are susceptible to supply shortages or supply changes, which could disrupt or delay our scheduled product deliveries to our end customers and may result in the loss of sales and end customers.
our products rely on key components, including integrated circuit components and power supplies that our contract manufacturers purchase on our behalf from a limited number of suppliers, including certain sole source providers. we do not have guaranteed supply contracts with any of our component suppliers, and our suppliers could delay shipments or cease manufacturing such products or selling them to us at any time. for example, in the past we have experienced shortages in inventory for dynamic random access memory integrated circuits and delayed releases of the next generation of chipset, which delayed our production and/or the release of our new products. the development of alternate sources for those components is time-consuming, difficult and costly. if we are unable to obtain a sufficient quantity of these components on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner, sales of our products could be delayed or halted entirely or we may be required to redesign our products. any of these events could result in lost sales and damage to our end-customer relationships, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
our reliance on component suppliers also yields the potential for their infringement or misappropriation of third party intellectual property rights with respect to components which may be incorporated into our products. we may not be indemnified by such component suppliers for such infringement or misappropriation claims. any litigation for which we do not receive indemnification could require us to incur significant legal expenses in defending against such claims or require us to pay substantial royalty payments or settlement amounts that would not be reimbursed by our component suppliers.
our product development efforts are also dependent upon our continued collaboration with our key merchant silicon vendors such as broadcom and intel. as we develop our product roadmap and continue to expand our relationships with these and other merchant silicon vendors, it is critical that we work in tandem with our key merchant silicon vendors to ensure that their silicon includes improved features and that our products take advantage of such improved features. this enables us to focus our research and development resources on our software core competencies and to leverage the investments made by merchant silicon vendors to achieve cost-effective solutions.
if our key merchant silicon vendors do not continue to collaborate in such a fashion, if they do not continue to innovate or if there are delays in the release of their products, our own product launches could be delayed, which could have a material effect on revenue and business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
in the event of a shortage or supply interruption from our component suppliers, we may not be able to develop alternate or second sources in a timely manner. further, long-term supply and maintenance obligations to end customers increase the duration for which specific components are required, which may increase the risk of component shortages or the cost of carrying inventory. in addition, our component suppliers change their selling prices frequently in response to market trends, including industry-wide increases in demand, and because we do not have contracts with these suppliers, we are susceptible to price fluctuations related to raw materials and components. if we are unable to pass component price increases along to our end customers or maintain stable pricing, our gross margins could be adversely affected and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could suffer.
because we depend on third-party manufacturers to build our products, we are susceptible to manufacturing delays and pricing fluctuations that could prevent us from shipping end-customer orders on time, if at all, or on a cost-effective basis, which may result in the loss of sales and end customers.
we depend on third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture our product lines. a significant portion of our cost of revenue consists of payments to these third-party contract manufacturers. our reliance on these third-party contract manufacturers reduces our control over the manufacturing process, quality assurance, product costs and product supply and timing, which exposes us to risk. to the extent that our products are manufactured at facilities in foreign countries, we may be subject to additional risks associated with complying with local rules and regulations in those jurisdictions. if we fail to manage our relationships with our third-party manufacturers effectively, or if these third-party manufacturers experience delays, disruptions or quality control problems in their operations, this could severely impair our ability to fulfill orders on time, if at all, or on a cost-effective basis.
our reliance on contract manufacturers also yields the potential for their infringement of third party intellectual property rights in the manufacturing of our products or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights in the manufacturing of other customers' products. if we are unable to manage our relationships with our third-party contract manufacturers effectively, or if these third-party manufacturers suffer delays or disruptions for any reason, experience increased manufacturing lead times, capacity constraints or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations or fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery, our ability to ship products to our end customers would be severely impaired, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects would be seriously harmed.
our contract manufacturers typically fulfill our supply requirements on the basis of individual orders. we do not have long-term contracts with our third-party manufacturers that guarantee capacity, the continuation of particular pricing terms or the extension of credit
24
limits. accordingly, they are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements, which could result in supply shortages, and the prices we are charged for manufacturing services could be increased on short notice. for example, a competitor could place large orders with the third-party manufacturer, thereby utilizing all or substantially all of such third-party manufacturer's capacity and leaving the manufacturer little or no capacity to fulfill our individual orders without price increases or delays, or at all. our contract with one of our contract manufacturers permits it to terminate the agreement for convenience, subject to prior notice requirements. we may not be able to develop alternate or second contract manufacturers in a timely manner.
if we add or change contract manufacturers, or change any manufacturing plant locations within a contract manufacturer network, we would add additional complexity and risk to our supply chain management. ensuring a new contract manufacturer or new plant location is qualified to manufacture our products to our standards and industry requirements could take significant effort and be time consuming and expensive. for example if we suffer an adverse ruling with respect to certain ongoing cisco litigation we are involved in before the ustic we may be required to add or change our manufacturers in order to comply with the ruling. any such addition or change in manufacturers may be extremely costly, time consuming and we may not be able to do so successfully.
in addition, we may be subject to additional significant challenges in ensuring that quality, processes and costs, among other issues, are consistent with our expectations and those of our customers. a new contract manufacturer or manufacturing location may not be able to scale its production of our products at the volumes or quality we require. this could also adversely affect our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our end customers, which could damage our customer relationships and cause the loss of sales to existing or potential end customers, late delivery penalties, delayed revenue or an increase in our costs which could adversely affect our gross margins. this could also result in increased levels of inventory subjecting us to increased excess and obsolete charges that could have a negative impact on our operating results.
any production interruptions or disruptions for any reason, such as a natural disaster, epidemic, capacity shortages, adverse results from intellectual property litigation or quality problems, at one of our manufacturing partners would adversely affect sales of our product lines manufactured by that manufacturing partner and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
if we are unable to increase market awareness of our company and our products, our revenue may not continue to grow or may decline.
we have not yet established broad market awareness of our products and services. market awareness of our value proposition and products and services will be essential to our continued growth and our success, particularly for the service provider and large enterprise markets. if our marketing efforts are unsuccessful in creating market awareness of our company and our products and services, then our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will be adversely affected, and we will not be able to achieve sustained growth.
the sales prices of our products and services may decrease, which may reduce our gross profits and adversely affect our results of operations.
the sales prices for our products and services may decline for a variety of reasons, including competitive pricing pressures, discounts, a change in our mix of products and services, the introduction of new products and services by us or by our competitors, promotional programs, product and related warranty costs or broader macroeconomic factors. in addition, we have provided, and may in the future provide, pricing discounts to large end customers, which may result in lower margins for the period in which such sales occur. our gross margins may also fluctuate as a result of the timing of such sales to large end customers.
we have experienced declines in sales prices for our products, including our 10 gigabit ethernet modular and fixed switches. competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we participate, and we expect competition to further increase in the future, thereby leading to increased pricing pressures. larger competitors with more diverse product and service offerings may reduce the price of products and services that compete with ours or may bundle them with other products and services. additionally, although we generally price our products worldwide in u.s. dollars, currency fluctuations in certain countries and regions may adversely affect actual prices that partners and end customers are willing to pay in those countries and regions. furthermore, we anticipate that the sales prices and gross profits for our products will decrease over product life cycles. decreased sales prices for any reason may reduce our gross profits and adversely affect our result of operations.
25
seasonality may cause fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations.
we operate on a december 31 year end and believe that there are significant seasonal factors which may cause sequential product revenue growth to be greater for the second and fourth quarters of our year than our first and third quarters. we believe that this seasonality results from a number of factors, including the procurement, budgeting and deployment cycles of many of our end customers. our rapid historical growth may have reduced the impact of seasonal or cyclical factors that might have influenced our business to date. as our increasing size causes our growth rate to slow, seasonal or cyclical variations in our operations may become more pronounced over time and may materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
if we are unable to hire, retain, train and motivate qualified personnel and senior management, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could suffer.
our future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, particularly software engineering and sales personnel. competition for highly skilled personnel is often intense, especially in the san francisco bay area where we have a substantial presence and need for highly skilled personnel. many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have to provide more attractive compensation packages and other amenities. research and development personnel are aggressively recruited by startup and growth companies, which are especially active in many of the technical areas and geographic regions in which we conduct product development. in addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in the high-technology industry, job candidates often consider the value of the stock-based compensation they are to receive in connection with their employment. declines in the market price of our stock could adversely affect our ability to attract, motivate or retain key employees. if we are unable to attract or retain qualified personnel, or if there are delays in hiring required personnel, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be seriously harmed.
also, to the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations that such personnel has been improperly solicited, that such personnel has divulged proprietary or other confidential information or that former employers own certain inventions or other work product. such claims could result in litigation. please see "-we may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us."
our future performance also depends on the continued services and continuing contributions of our senior management to execute our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations. our employment arrangements with our employees do not require that they continue to work for us for any specified period, and therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time. the loss of our key personnel, including jayshree ullal, our chief executive officer, andy bechtolsheim, our founder and chief development officer, and kenneth duda, our founder, chief technology officer and svp software engineering or other members of our senior management team, sales and marketing team or engineering team, or any difficulty attracting or retaining other highly qualified personnel in the future, could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
we are subject to a number of risks associated with the expansion of our international sales and operations.
our ability to grow our business and our future success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our operations and customer base worldwide. we have a limited history of marketing, selling and supporting our products and services internationally. operating in a global marketplace, we are subject to risks associated with having an international reach and requirements such as compliance with applicable anti-corruption laws.
one such applicable anti-corruption law is the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, or fcpa, which generally prohibits u.s. companies and its employees and intermediaries from making corrupt payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business, securing an advantage and directing business to another, and requires companies to maintain accurate books and records and a system of internal accounting controls. under the fcpa, u.s. companies may be held liable for the corrupt actions taken by directors, officers, employees, agents, or other strategic or local partners or representatives. as such, if we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the fcpa or similar legislation, governmental authorities in the u.s. and elsewhere could seek to impose civil and/or criminal fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditions. failure to comply with anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, such as the fcpa and the united kingdom bribery act of 2010, or the united kingdom bribery act, and similar laws associated with our activities outside the u.s., could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences. we intend to increase our international sales and business and, as such, the risk of violating laws such as the fcpa and united kingdom bribery act increases.
additionally, as a result of our international reach, we must hire and train experienced personnel to staff and manage our foreign operations. to the extent that we experience difficulties in recruiting, training, managing and retaining an international staff, and specifically staff related to sales management and sales personnel, we may experience difficulties in sales productivity in foreign markets. we also enter into strategic distributor and reseller relationships with companies in certain international markets where we do not have a local presence. if we are not able to maintain successful strategic distributor relationships internationally or to recruit additional companies to enter into strategic distributor relationships, our future success in these international markets could be limited. business practices in the international markets that we serve may differ from those in the u.s. and may require us in the future to include terms other than our standard terms in end-customer contracts, although to date we generally have not done so. to the extent that we may enter into end-
26
customer contracts in the future that include non-standard terms related to payment, warranties or performance obligations, our results of operations may be adversely affected.
additionally, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including the following:
•   greater difficulty in enforcing contracts and accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods;
•   increased expenses incurred in establishing and maintaining our international operations;
•   fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies where we do business;
•   greater difficulty and costs in recruiting local experienced personnel;
•   wage inflation in certain growing economies;
•   general economic and political conditions in these foreign markets;
•   economic uncertainty around the world as a result of sovereign debt issues;
•   communication and integration problems resulting from cultural and geographic dispersion;
•   limitations on our ability to access cash resources in our international operations;
•   ability to establish necessary business relationships and to comply with local business requirements;
•   risks associated with trade restrictions and foreign legal requirements, including the importation, certification and localization of our products required in foreign countries;
•   greater risk of unexpected changes in regulatory practices, tariffs and tax laws and treaties;
•   the uncertainty of protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;
•   greater risk of a failure of foreign employees to comply with both u.s. and foreign laws, including antitrust regulations, the fcpa and any trade regulations ensuring fair trade practices; and
•   heightened risk of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements that may impact financial results and result in restatements of, or irregularities in, financial statements.
these and other factors could harm our ability to gain future international revenue and, consequently, materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. expanding our existing international operations and entering into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial commitments. our failure to successfully manage our international operations and the associated risks effectively could limit our future growth or materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
our ability to sell our products is highly dependent on the quality of our support and services offerings, and our failure to offer high-quality support and services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
once our products are deployed within our end customers' networks, our end customers depend on our support organization and our channel partners to resolve any issues relating to our products. high-quality support is critical for the successful marketing and sale of our products. if we or our channel partners do not assist our end customers in deploying our products effectively, do not succeed in helping our end customers resolve post-deployment issues quickly or do not provide adequate ongoing support, it could adversely affect our ability to sell our products to existing end customers and could harm our reputation with potential end customers. in addition, as we expand our operations internationally, our support organization will face additional challenges, including those associated with delivering support, training and documentation in languages other than english. our failure or the failure of our channel partners to maintain high-quality support and services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
we may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us.
from time to time, we may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business, including patent, copyright, commercial, product liability, employment, class action, whistleblower and other litigation and claims, in addition to governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. such matters can be time-consuming, divert management's attention and resources, cause us to incur significant expenses or liability and/or require us to change our business practices. because of the potential risks, expenses and uncertainties of litigation, we may, from time to time, settle disputes, even where we have meritorious claims or defenses, by agreeing to settlement agreements. because litigation is inherently unpredictable, we cannot assure you that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
for more information regarding the litigation in which we are currently involved, see the "legal proceedings" subheading in note 5. commitments and contingencies of notes to condensed consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8, of this annual report on form 10-k.
adverse economic conditions or reduced information technology and network infrastructure spending may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
our business depends on the overall demand for information technology, network connectivity and access to data and applications. weak domestic or global economic conditions, fear or anticipation of such conditions or a reduction in information technology and network infrastructure spending even if economic conditions improve, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results
27
of operations and prospects in a number of ways, including longer sales cycles, lower prices for our products and services, higher default rates among our distributors, reduced unit sales and lower or no growth. for example, the ongoing debt concerns in many countries in europe have caused, and are likely to continue to cause, uncertainty and instability in local economies and in global financial markets, particularly if any future sovereign debt defaults or significant bank failures or defaults occur. market uncertainty and instability in europe could intensify or spread further, particularly if ongoing stabilization efforts prove insufficient. concerns have been raised as to the financial, political and legal ineffectiveness of measures taken to date. continuing or worsening economic instability in europe and elsewhere could adversely affect spending for it, network infrastructure, systems and tools. continued turmoil in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world may also affect the overall demand for our products. although we do not believe that our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects have been significantly adversely affected by economic and political uncertainty in europe and other countries, deterioration of such conditions may harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects in the future. a prolonged period of economic uncertainty or a downturn may also significantly affect financing markets, the availability of capital and the terms and conditions of financing arrangements, including the overall cost of financing as well as the financial health or creditworthiness of our end customers. circumstances may arise in which we need, or desire, to raise additional capital, and such capital may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.
assertions by third parties of infringement or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights, or other lawsuits asserted against us, could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
patent and other intellectual property disputes are common in the network infrastructure industry and have resulted in protracted and expensive litigation for many companies. many companies in the network infrastructure industry, including our competitors and other third parties, as well as non-practicing entities, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, which they may use to assert claims of patent infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights against us. from time to time, they have or may in the future also assert such claims against us, our end customers or channel partners whom we typically indemnify against claims that our products infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of third parties.
as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur, claims of infringement, misappropriation and other violations of intellectual property rights may increase. any claim of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights by a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim, distract our management from our business and require us to cease use of such intellectual property. in addition, some claims for patent infringement may relate to subcomponents that we purchase from third parties. if these third parties are unable or unwilling to indemnify us for these claims, we could be substantially harmed.
the patent portfolios of most of our competitors are larger than ours. this disparity may increase the risk that our competitors may sue us for patent infringement and may limit our ability to counterclaim for patent infringement or settle through patent cross-licenses. in addition, future assertions of patent rights by third parties, and any resulting litigation, may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection. we cannot assure you that we are not infringing or otherwise violating any third-party intellectual property rights.
the third-party asserters of intellectual property claims may be unreasonable in their demands, or may simply refuse to settle, which could lead to expensive settlement payments, prolonged periods of litigation and related expenses, additional burdens on employees or other resources, distraction from our business, supply stoppages and lost sales.
an adverse outcome of a dispute (including those lawsuits described under the "legal proceedings" subheading in note 5. commitments and contingencies of notes to condensed consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8, of this annual report on form 10-k) may require us to pay substantial damages including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed a third party's patents; cease making, licensing or using solutions that are alleged to infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property of others; expend additional development resources to attempt to redesign our products or services or otherwise to develop non-infringing technology, which may not be successful; enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies or intellectual property rights; and indemnify our partners and other third parties. any damages or royalty obligations we may become subject to as a result of an adverse outcome, and any third-party indemnity we may need to provide, could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. royalty or licensing agreements, if required or desirable, may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and may require significant royalty payments and other expenditures. further, there is little or no information publicly available concerning market or fair values for license fees, which can lead to overpayment of license or settlement fees. in addition, some licenses may be non-exclusive, and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. suppliers subject to third-party intellectual property claims also may choose or be forced to discontinue or alter their arrangements with us, with little or no advance notice to us. any of these events could seriously harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
28
our standard sales contracts contain indemnification provisions requiring us to defend our end customers against third-party claims, including against infringement of certain intellectual property rights, that could expose us to losses which could seriously harm our business, financial conditions, results of operations and prospects.
under the indemnification provisions of our standard sales contracts, we agree to defend our end customers against third-party claims asserting infringement of certain intellectual property rights, which may include patents, copyrights, trademarks or trade secrets, and to pay judgments entered on such claims. for example, we are currently involved in ongoing cisco litigation claims before the ustic. an adverse ruling in such litigation may potentially expose us to claims in the event that claims are brought against our customers based on the ruling and we are required to indemnify such customers.
our exposure under these indemnification provisions is frequently limited to the total amount paid by our end customer under the agreement. however, certain agreements include indemnification provisions that could potentially expose us to losses in excess of the amount received under the agreement. any of these events, including claims for indemnification, could seriously harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce our rights.
we depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. we rely on trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection.
the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. we may choose not to seek patent protection for certain innovations and may choose not to pursue patent protection in certain jurisdictions. further, we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. to the extent that additional patents are issued from our patent applications, which is not certain, they may be contested, circumvented or invalidated in the future. moreover, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages, and, as with any technology, competitors may be able to develop similar or superior technologies to our own now or in the future. in addition, we rely on confidentiality or license agreements with third parties in connection with their use of our products and technology. there is no guarantee that such parties will abide by the terms of such agreements or that we will be able to adequately enforce our rights, in part because we rely on "shrink-wrap" licenses in some instances.
we have not registered our trademarks in all geographic markets. failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our ability to enforce and defend our trademark rights and result in indemnification claims. further, any claim of infringement by a third party, even those claims without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against such claim, could divert management attention from our business and could require us to cease use of such intellectual property in certain geographic markets.
despite our efforts, the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights, and our ability to police such misappropriation or infringement is uncertain, particularly in countries outside of the united states.
detecting and protecting against the unauthorized use of our products, technology and proprietary rights is expensive, difficult and, in some cases, impossible. litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, either of which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, and there is no guarantee that we would be successful. furthermore, many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to protecting their technology or intellectual property rights than we do. accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property, which could result in a substantial loss of our market share.
we rely on the availability of licenses to third-party software and other intellectual property.
many of our products and services include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties, and we otherwise use software and other intellectual property licensed from third parties in our business. this exposes us to risks over which we may have little or no control. for example, a licensor may have difficulties keeping up with technological changes or may stop supporting the software or other intellectual property that it licenses to us. also, it will be necessary in the future to renew licenses, expand the scope of existing licenses or seek new licenses, relating to various aspects of these products and services or otherwise relating to our business, which may result in increased license fees. these licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. in addition, a third party may assert that we or our end customers are in breach of the terms of a license, which could, among other things, give such third party the right to terminate a license or seek damages from us, or both. the inability to obtain or maintain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain or maintain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters, could result in delays in releases of products and services and could otherwise disrupt our business, until equivalent technology can be identified, licensed or developed, if at all, and integrated into our products and services or otherwise in the conduct of our business. moreover, the inclusion in our products and services of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis may limit our
29
ability to differentiate our products from those of our competitors. any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
our products contain third-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products.
our products contain software modules licensed to us by third-party authors under "open source" licenses. use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software that we use. if we combine our software with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain open source licenses, be required to release portions of the source code of our software to the public. this would allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of product sales for us.
although we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by u.s. courts, and these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. moreover, we cannot assure you that our processes for controlling our use of open source software in our products will be effective. if we are held to have breached the terms of an open source software license, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our products on terms that are not economically feasible, to re-engineer our products, to discontinue the sale of our products if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis or to make generally available, in source code form, our proprietary code, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
sales of our 7000 series of switches generate most of our product revenue, and if we are unable to continue to grow sales of these products, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will suffer.
historically, we have derived substantially all of our product revenue from sales of our 7000 series of switches, and we expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. a decline in the price of these products and related services, or our inability to increase sales of these products, would harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects more seriously than if we derived significant revenue from a larger variety of product lines and services. our future financial performance will also depend upon successfully developing and selling next-generation versions of our 7000 series of switches. if we fail to deliver new products, new features, or new releases that end customers want and that allow us to maintain leadership in what will continue to be a competitive market environment, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will be harmed.
we expect our gross margins to vary over time and to be adversely affected by numerous factors.
we expect our gross margins to vary over time and to be affected by numerous factors, including:
•   changes in end-customer or product mix, including mix of configurations within each product group;
•   introduction of new products, including products with price-performance advantages;
•   our ability to reduce production costs;
•   entry into new markets or growth in lower margin markets;
•   entry in markets with different pricing and cost structures;
•   pricing discounts;
•   increases in material, labor or other manufacturing-related costs, which could be significant especially during periods of supply constraints;
•   costs associated with defending intellectual property infringement and other claims and the potential outcomes of such disputes, such as those claims discussed in "legal proceedings," including the cisco and optumsoft litigation matters;
•   excess inventory and inventory holding charges;
•   obsolescence charges;
•   changes in shipment volume;
•   the timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals;
•   increased cost, loss of cost savings or dilution of savings due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to inventory holding periods if parts ordering does not correctly anticipate product demand or if the financial health of either contract manufacturers or suppliers deteriorates;
•   lower than expected benefits from value engineering;
•   increased price competition;
•   changes in distribution channels;
•   increased warranty costs; and
•   how well we execute our strategy and operating plans.
to remain competitive, we must successfully manage product introductions and transitions.
the success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful product development, market acceptance, our ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the
30
availability of new merchant silicon chips, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction. accordingly, we cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions on our business and results of operations.
our sales cycles can be long and unpredictable, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense. as a result, our sales and revenue are difficult to predict and may vary substantially from period to period, which may cause our results of operations to fluctuate significantly.
the timing of our sales and revenue recognition is difficult to predict because of the length and unpredictability of our products' sales cycles. a sales cycle is the period between initial contact with a prospective end customer and any sale of our products. end-customer orders often involve the purchase of multiple products. these orders are complex and difficult to complete because prospective end customers generally consider a number of factors over an extended period of time before committing to purchase the products and solutions we sell. end customers, especially in the case of our large end customers, often view the purchase of our products as a significant and strategic decision and require considerable time to evaluate, test and qualify our products prior to making a purchase decision and placing an order. the length of time that end customers devote to their evaluation, contract negotiation and budgeting processes varies significantly. our products' sales cycles can be lengthy in certain cases, especially with respect to our prospective large end customers. during the sales cycle, we expend significant time and money on sales and marketing activities and make investments in evaluation equipment, all of which lower our operating margins, particularly if no sale occurs. even if an end customer decides to purchase our products, there are many factors affecting the timing of our recognition of revenue, which makes our revenue difficult to forecast. for example, there may be unexpected delays in an end customer's internal procurement processes, particularly for some of our larger end customers for which our products represent a very small percentage of their total procurement activity. there are many other factors specific to end customers that contribute to the timing of their purchases and the variability of our revenue recognition, including the strategic importance of a particular project to an end customer, budgetary constraints and changes in their personnel.
even after an end customer makes a purchase, there may be circumstances or terms relating to the purchase that delay our ability to recognize revenue from that purchase. for example, the sale of our products may be subject to acceptance testing. in addition, the significance and timing of our product enhancements, and the introduction of new products by our competitors, may also affect end customers' purchases. for all of these reasons, it is difficult to predict whether a sale will be completed, the particular period in which a sale will be completed or the period in which revenue from a sale will be recognized. if our sales cycles lengthen, our revenue could be lower than expected, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
our business depends on end customers renewing their maintenance and support contracts. any decline in maintenance renewals could harm our future business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
we typically sell our products with maintenance and support as part of the initial purchase, and a portion of our annual revenue comes from renewals of maintenance and support contracts. our end customers have no obligation to renew their maintenance and support contracts after the expiration of the initial period, and they may elect not to renew their maintenance and support contracts, to renew their maintenance and support contracts at lower prices through alternative channel partners or to reduce the product quantity under their maintenance and support contracts, thereby reducing our future revenue from maintenance and support contracts. if our end customers, especially our large end customers, do not renew their maintenance and support contracts or if they renew them on terms that are less favorable to us, our revenue may decline and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will suffer.
industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
most of our competitors have made acquisitions and/or have entered into or extended partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer more comprehensive product lines, including cloud networking solutions. for example, in the last few years alone dell acquired force10, ibm acquired blade network technology, hewlett packard acquired 3com, brocade acquired foundry networks, juniper acquired contrail and vmware acquired nicira.
moreover, large system vendors are increasingly seeking to deliver top-to-bottom cloud networking solutions to end customers that combine cloud-focused hardware and software solutions to provide an alternative to our products.
we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations. companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us. industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete with us, including any competitors that seek to become sole source vendors for end customers. this could lead to more variability in our results of operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
our business is subject to the risks of warranty claims, product returns, product liability and product defects.
our products are very complex and despite testing prior to their release, they have contained and may contain undetected defects or errors, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released. product defects or errors could affect the performance of
31
our products and could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products, adversely affect our reputation and our end customers' willingness to buy products from us and adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products. real or perceived errors, failures or bugs in our products could cause us to lose revenue or market share, increase our service costs, cause us to incur substantial costs in redesigning the products, cause us to lose significant end-customers, subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks, any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
additionally, real or perceived errors, failures or bugs in our products could result in claims by end customers for losses that they sustain. if end customers make these types of claims, we may be required, or may choose, for end-customer relations or other reasons, to expend additional resources in order to address the problem. we may also be required to repair or replace such products or provide a refund for the purchase price for such products. liability provisions in our standard terms and conditions of sale, and those of our resellers and distributors, may not be enforceable under some circumstances or may not fully or effectively protect us from end-customer claims and related liabilities and costs, including indemnification obligations under our agreements with end customers, resellers and distributors. the sale and support of our products also entail the risk of product liability claims. we maintain insurance to protect against certain types of claims associated with the use of our products, but our insurance coverage may not adequately cover any such claims. in addition, even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in expenditures of funds in connection with litigation and divert management's time and other resources.
in addition to our own direct sales force, we rely on distributors, systems integrators and value-added resellers to sell our products, and our failure to effectively develop, manage or prevent disruptions to our distribution channels and the processes and procedures that support them could cause a reduction in the number of end customers of our products.
our future success is highly dependent upon maintaining our relationships with distributors, systems integrators and value-added resellers and establishing additional sales channel relationships. we anticipate that sales of our products to a limited number of channel partners will continue to account for a material portion of our total product revenue for the foreseeable future. we provide our channel partners with specific training and programs to assist them in selling our products, but these steps may not be effective. in addition, our channel partners may be unsuccessful in marketing, selling and supporting our products and services. if we are unable to develop and maintain effective sales incentive programs for our channel partners, we may not be able to incentivize these partners to sell our products to end customers. these partners may have incentives to promote our competitors' products to the detriment of our own or may cease selling our products altogether. one of our channel partners could elect to consolidate or enter into a strategic partnership with one of our competitors, which could reduce or eliminate our future opportunities with that channel partner. our agreements with our channel partners may generally be terminated for any reason by either party with advance notice. we may be unable to retain these channel partners or secure additional or replacement channel partners. the loss of one or more of our significant channel partners requires extensive training, and any new or expanded relationship with a channel partner may take several months or more to achieve productivity.
where we rely on the channel partners for sales of our products, we may have little or no contact with the ultimate users of our products that purchase through such channel partners, thereby making it more difficult for us to establish brand awareness, ensure proper delivery and installation of our products, service ongoing end-customer requirements, estimate end-customer demand and respond to evolving end-customer needs. in addition, our channel partner sales structure could subject us to lawsuits, potential liability and reputational harm if, for example, any of our channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our products or services to end customers, fail to comply with their contractual obligations or violate laws or our corporate policies. if we fail to effectively manage our existing sales channels, or if our channel partners are unsuccessful in fulfilling the orders for our products, if we are unable to enter into arrangements with, and retain a sufficient number of, high-quality channel partners in each of the regions in which we sell products and keep them motivated to sell our products, our ability to sell our products and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will be harmed.
a portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities, which are subject to a number of challenges and risks.
we anticipate increasing our sales efforts to u.s. and foreign, federal, state and local governmental end customers in the future. sales to government entities are subject to a number of risks. selling to government entities can be highly competitive, expensive and time consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale. the substantial majority of our sales to date to government entities have been made indirectly through our channel partners. government certification requirements for products like ours may change and, in doing so, restrict our ability to sell into the government sector until we have attained revised certifications. government demand and payment for our products and services may be affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our products and services. government entities may have statutory, contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default, and any such termination may adversely impact our future business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. selling to government entities may also require us to comply with various regulations that are not applicable to sales to non-government entities, including regulations that may relate to pricing, classified material and other matters. complying with such regulations may also require us to put in place controls and procedures to monitor compliance with the applicable regulations that may be costly or not possible. we are not currently certified to perform work under classified contracts with government entities. failure to comply with any such regulations could adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors' administrative processes, and any unfavorable audit
32
could result in the government ceasing to buy our products and services, a reduction of revenue, fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. the u.s. government may require certain products that it purchases to be manufactured in the u.s. and other relatively high-cost manufacturing locations, and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet these requirements. any of these and other circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
our products must interoperate with operating systems, software applications and hardware that is developed by others, and if we are unable to devote the necessary resources to ensure that our products interoperate with such software and hardware, we may lose or fail to increase market share and experience a weakening demand for our products.
generally, our products comprise only a part of the data center and must interoperate with our end customers' existing infrastructure, specifically their networks, servers, software and operating systems, which may be manufactured by a wide variety of vendors and original equipment manufacturers, or oems. our products must comply with established industry standards in order to interoperate with the servers, storage, software and other networking equipment in the data center such that all systems function efficiently together. we depend on the vendors of servers and systems in a data center to support prevailing industry standards. often, these vendors are significantly larger and more influential in driving industry standards than we are. also, some industry standards may not be widely adopted or implemented uniformly, and competing standards may emerge that may be preferred by our end customers.
in addition, when new or updated versions of these software operating systems or applications are introduced, we must sometimes develop updated versions of our software so that our products will interoperate properly. we may not accomplish these development efforts quickly, cost-effectively or at all. these development efforts require capital investment and the devotion of engineering resources. if we fail to maintain compatibility with these systems and applications, our end customers may not be able to adequately utilize our products, and we may lose or fail to increase market share and experience a weakening in demand for our products, among other consequences, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate these controls.
our products may be subject to various export controls and because we incorporate encryption technology into certain of our products, certain of our products may be exported from various countries only with the required export license or through an export license exception. if we were to fail to comply with the applicable export control laws, customs regulations, economic sanctions or other applicable laws, we could be subject to monetary damages or the imposition of restrictions which could be material to our business, operating results and prospects and could also harm our reputation. further, there could be criminal penalties for knowing or willful violations, including incarceration for culpable employees and managers. obtaining the necessary export license or other authorization for a particular sale may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. furthermore, certain export control and economic sanctions laws prohibit the shipment of certain products, technology, software and services to embargoed countries and sanctioned governments, entities, and persons. even though we take precautions to ensure that our channel partners comply with all relevant regulations, any failure by our channel partners to comply with such regulations could have negative consequences, including reputational harm, government investigations and penalties.
as our company grows we also continue developing procedures and controls to comply with export control and other applicable laws. historically, we have had some instances where we inadvertently have not fully complied with certain export control laws, but we have disclosed them to, and implemented corrective actions with, the appropriate government agencies.
in addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import permit and license requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our end customers' ability to implement our products in those countries. any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or potential end customers with international operations or create delays in the introduction of our products into international markets. any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
failure to comply with governmental laws and regulations could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
our business is subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies, including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws, workplace safety, product safety, environmental laws, consumer protection laws, anti-bribery laws, import/export controls, federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations. in certain jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the united states. from time to time, we may receive inquiries from such governmental agencies or we may make voluntary disclosures regarding our compliance with applicable governmental regulations or requirements relating to import/export controls, federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations which could lead to formal investigations. noncompliance with applicable government regulations or requirements could subject us to sanctions, mandatory product
33
recalls, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and criminal penalties or injunctions. if any governmental sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected. in addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management's attention and resources and an increase in professional fees. enforcement actions and sanctions could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
we may invest in or acquire other businesses which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
as part of our business strategy, we have and may continue to make investments in complementary companies, products or technologies which could involve licenses, additional channels of distribution, discount pricing or investments in or acquisitions of other companies. however, we do not have significant experience in making investments in other companies nor have we made any acquisitions to date, and as a result, our ability as an organization to evaluate and/or complete investments or acquire and integrate other companies, products or technologies in a successful manner is unproven. we may not be able to find suitable investment or acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete such investments or acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. if we do complete investments or acquisitions, we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals, and any investments or acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by our end customers, investors and securities analysts.
in addition, investments and acquisitions may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. for example, if we are unsuccessful at integrating any acquisitions or retaining key talent from those acquisitions, or the technologies associated with such acquisitions, into our company, the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of the combined company could be adversely affected. any integration process may require significant time and resources, and we may not be able to manage the process successfully. we may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology or personnel or accurately forecast the financial effects of an acquisition transaction, including accounting charges. we may have to pay cash, incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any such investment or acquisition, each of which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market price of our common stock. the sale of equity or issuance of debt to finance any such acquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders. the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. moreover, if the investment or acquisition becomes impaired, we may be required to take an impairment charge, which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market price of our common stock.
if we needed to raise additional capital to expand our operations and invest in new products, our failure to do so on favorable terms could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
we expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future. if we did need to raise additional funds to expand our operations and invest in new products, we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all. if we raise additional equity financing, our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests, and the market price of our common stock could decline. furthermore, if we engage in debt financing, the holders of such debt would have priority over the holders of common stock, and we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness or impose other restrictions on our business. we may also be required to take other actions that would otherwise be in the interests of the debt holders, including maintaining specified liquidity or other ratios, any of which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. if we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms, if at all, we may not be able to, among other things:
•   evolve or enhance our products and services;
•   continue to expand our sales and marketing and research and development organizations;
•   acquire complementary technologies, products or businesses;
•   expand operations, in the u.s. or internationally;
•   hire, train and retain employees; or
•   respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements.
our failure to do any of these things could seriously harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, our results of operations could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock.
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as described in part ii item 7 of "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations," the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, contract manufacturing liabilities and income taxes. if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, our results of operations may be adversely
34
affected and may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock.
we are exposed to the credit risk of our channel partners and some of our end customers, which could result in material losses.
most of our sales are on an open credit basis, with standard payment terms of 30 days in the united states and, because of local customs or conditions, longer in some markets outside the u.s. we monitor individual end-customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements, seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the end customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts. we are unable to recognize revenue from shipments until the collection of those amounts becomes reasonably assured. any significant delay or default in the collection of significant accounts receivable could result in an increased need for us to obtain working capital from other sources, possibly on worse terms than we could have negotiated if we had established such working capital resources prior to such delays or defaults. any significant default could adversely affect our results of operations and delay our ability to recognize revenue.
a material portion of our sales is derived through our distributors, systems integrators and value-added resellers. some of our distributors, systems integrators and value-added resellers may experience financial difficulties, which could adversely affect our collection of accounts receivable. distributors tend to have more limited financial resources than other systems integrators, value-added resellers and end customers. distributors represent potential sources of increased credit risk because they may be less likely to have the reserve resources required to meet payment obligations. our exposure to credit risks of our channel partners may increase if our channel partners and their end customers are adversely affected by global or regional economic conditions. one or more of these channel partners could delay payments or default on credit extended to them, either of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
if we or our partners fail to comply with environmental requirements, our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and reputation could be adversely affected.
we and our partners, including our contract manufacturers, are subject to various local, state, federal and international environmental laws and regulations, including laws governing the hazardous material content of our products and laws relating to the collection, recycling and disposal of electrical and electronic equipment. examples of these laws and regulations include the european union, or eu, restrictions on the use of hazardous substances directive, or rohs directive, and the eu waste electrical and electronic equipment directive, or weee directive, as well as the implementing legislation of the eu member states. similar laws and regulations have been passed or are pending in china, south korea, norway and japan and may be enacted in other regions, including in the u.s., and we or our partners, including our contract manufacturers, are, or may in the future be, subject to these laws and regulations.
the eu rohs directive and the similar laws of other jurisdictions limit the content of certain hazardous materials such as lead, mercury and cadmium in the manufacture of electrical equipment, including our products. our products currently comply with the rohs directive; however, if there are future changes to this directive, we may be required to re-engineer our products to use components compatible with these regulations. this re-engineering and component substitution could result in additional costs to us or disrupt our operations or logistics.
we are also subject to environmental laws and regulations governing the management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. our failure, or the failure of our partners, including our contract manufacturers, to comply with past, present and future environmental laws could result in fines, penalties, third-party claims, reduced sales of our products, substantial product inventory write-offs and reputational damage, any of which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. we also expect that our business will be affected by new environmental laws and regulations on an ongoing basis applicable to us and our partners, including our contract manufacturers. to date, our expenditures for environmental compliance have not had a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows. although we cannot predict the future effect of such laws or regulations, they will likely result in additional costs or require us to change the content or manufacturing of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
our sales contracts are primarily denominated in u.s. dollars, and therefore substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk. however, a strengthening u.s. dollar could increase the real cost of our products to our end customers outside of the u.s., which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. in addition, a decrease in the value of the u.s. dollar relative to foreign currencies could increase our product and operating costs in foreign locations. further, an increasing portion of our operating expenses is incurred outside the u.s., is denominated in foreign currencies and is subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. if we are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with the currency fluctuations, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected.
35
our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, power outages, floods and other catastrophic events and to interruption by manmade problems such as terrorism.
our corporate headquarters and the operations of our key manufacturing vendors, logistics providers and partners, as well as many of our customers, are located in areas exposed to risks of natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis, including the san francisco bay area, japan and taiwan. a significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, tsunami, fire or a flood, or other catastrophic event such as a disease outbreak, could have a material adverse effect on our or their business, which could in turn materially affect our financial condition, results of operations and prospects. for example, in the event our service providers' information technology systems or manufacturing or logistics abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above, shipments could be delayed, which could result in missed financial targets, such as revenue and shipment targets, for a particular quarter. further, if a natural disaster occurs in a region from which we derive a significant portion of our revenue, end customers in that region may delay or forego purchases of our products, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. in addition, acts of terrorism could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our manufacturer, logistics providers, partners or end customers or the economy as a whole. given our typical concentration of sales at each quarter end, any disruption in the business of our manufacturer, logistics providers, partners or end customers that affects sales at the end of our quarter could have a particularly significant adverse effect on our quarterly results. all of the aforementioned risks may be augmented if our disaster recovery plans and those of our manufacturers, logistics providers or partners prove to be inadequate. to the extent that any of the above results in delays or cancellations of end-customer orders, or delays in the manufacture, deployment or shipment of our products, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects would be adversely affected.
breaches of our cybersecurity systems could degrade our ability to conduct our business operations and deliver products and services to our customers, delay our ability to recognize revenue, compromise the integrity of our software products, result in significant data losses and the theft of our intellectual property, damage our reputation, expose us to liability to third parties and require us to incur significant additional costs to maintain the security of our networks and data.
we increasingly depend upon our it systems to conduct virtually all of our business operations, ranging from our internal operations and product development activities to our marketing and sales efforts and communications with our customers and business partners. computer programmers may attempt to penetrate our network security, or that of our website, and misappropriate our proprietary information or cause interruptions of our service. because the techniques used by such computer programmers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques. in addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including "bugs" and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. we have also outsourced a number of our business functions to third-parties, including our manufacturers, logistics providers, and cloud service providers, and our business operations also depend, in part, on the success of these third parties' own cybersecurity measures. similarly, we rely upon distributors, resellers and system integrators to sell our products and our sales operations depend, in part, on the reliability of their cybersecurity measures. additionally, we depend upon our employees to appropriately handle confidential data and deploy our it resources in safe and secure fashion that does not expose our network systems to security breaches and the loss of data. accordingly, if our cybersecurity systems and those of our contractors fail to protect against unauthorized access, sophisticated cyber attacks and the mishandling of data by our employees and contractors, our ability to conduct our business effectively could be damaged in a number of ways, including:
•   sensitive data regarding our business, including intellectual property and other proprietary data, could be stolen;
•   our electronic communications systems, including email and other methods, could be disrupted, and our ability to conduct our business operations could be seriously damaged until such systems can be restored;
•   our ability to process customer orders and electronically deliver products and services could be degraded, and our distribution channels could be disrupted, resulting in delays in revenue recognition;
•   defects and security vulnerabilities could be introduced into our software, thereby damaging the reputation and perceived reliability and security of our products and potentially making the data systems of our customers vulnerable to further data loss and cyber incidents; and
•   personally identifiable data of our customers, employees and business partners could be compromised.
should any of the above events occur, we could be subject to significant claims for liability from our customers and regulatory actions from governmental agencies. in addition, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights could be compromised and our reputation and competitive position could be significantly harmed. also, the regulatory and contractual actions, litigations, investigations, fines, penalties and liabilities relating to data breaches that result in losses of personally identifiable or credit card information of users of our services can be significant in terms of fines and reputational impact and necessitate changes to our business operations that may be disruptive to us. additionally, we could incur significant costs in order to upgrade our cybersecurity systems and remediate damages. consequently, our financial performance and results of operations could be adversely affected.
we believe our long-term value as a company will be greater if we focus primarily on growth instead of profitability.
our business strategy is to focus primarily on our long-term growth. as a result, our profitability in any given period may be lower than it would be if our strategy was to maximize short-term profitability. expenditures on research and development, sales and
36
marketing, infrastructure and other such investments may not ultimately grow our business, prospects or cause long term profitability. for example, in order to support our strong growth, we have accelerated our investment in infrastructure, such as enterprise resource planning software and other technologies to improve the efficiency of our operations. as a result, we expect our levels of operating profit could decline in the short to medium term. if we are ultimately unable to achieve profitability at the level anticipated by analysts and our stockholders, the market price of our common stock may decline.
we may not generate positive returns on our research and development investments.
developing our products is expensive, and the investment in product development may involve a long payback cycle. in 2015, 2014 and 2013, our research and development expenses were $209.4 million, or approximately 25.0% of our revenue, $148.9 million, or approximately 25.5% of our revenue, and $98.6 million, or approximately 27.3% of our revenue, respectively. we expect to continue to invest heavily in software development in order to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform, introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership. we believe one of our greatest strengths lies in the speed of our product development efforts. by investing in research and development, we believe we will be well positioned to continue our rapid growth and take advantage of our large market opportunity. we expect that our results of operations will be impacted by the timing and size of these investments. these investments may take several years to generate positive returns, if ever.
we provide access to our software and other selected source code to certain partners, which creates additional risk that our competitors could develop products that are similar to or better than ours.
our success and ability to compete depend substantially upon our internally developed technology, which is incorporated in the source code for our products. we seek to protect the source code, design code, documentation and other information relating to our software, under trade secret, patent and copyright laws. however, we have chosen to provide access to selected source code of our software to several of our partners for co-development, as well as for open application programming interfaces, or apis, formats and protocols. though we generally control access to our source code and other intellectual property and enter into confidentiality or license agreements with such partners as well as with our employees and consultants, this combination of procedural and contractual safeguards may be insufficient to protect our trade secrets and other rights to our technology. our protective measures may be inadequate, especially because we may not be able to prevent our partners, employees or consultants from violating any agreements or licenses we may have in place or abusing their access granted to our source code. improper disclosure or use of our source code could help competitors develop products similar to or better than ours.
changes in our provision for income taxes or our effective tax rate, the enactment of new tax laws or changes in the application of existing tax laws of various jurisdictions or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results.
our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by several factors, many of which are outside of our control, including earnings that are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; our ability to generate and use tax attributes; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; expiration of or lapses in the federal research and development ("r&d") tax credit laws; transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our inter-company r&d cost sharing arrangement and legal structure; tax effects of nondeductible compensation, including certain stock-based compensation; tax costs related to inter-company realignments; changes in accounting principles; adverse tax consequences, including imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by subsidiaries or customers; a change in our decision to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings or changes in tax laws and regulations, including possible u.s. changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules.
significant judgment is required to evaluate our tax positions and determine our provision for income taxes. the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions, including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes, which if settled unfavorably could adversely affect our provision for income taxes or additional paid-in capital. in addition, tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. recent changes to u.s. tax laws, including limitations on the ability of taxpayers to claim and utilize foreign tax credits and the deferral of certain tax deductions until earnings outside of the u.s. are repatriated to the u.s., as well as changes to u.s. tax laws that may be enacted in the future, could impact the tax treatment of our foreign earnings, as well as cash and cash equivalent balances we currently maintain outside of the u.s.
further, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities. audits by the internal revenue service or other tax authorities are subject to inherent uncertainties and could result in unfavorable outcomes, including potential fines or penalties. as we operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions, the application of tax laws can be subject to diverging and sometimes conflicting interpretations by tax authorities of these jurisdictions. the expense of defending and resolving such an audit may be significant. the amount of time to resolve an audit is also unpredictable and may divert management's attention from our business operations. we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. we cannot assure you that fluctuations in our provision for income taxes or our effective tax rate, the enactment of new tax laws or changes in the application or interpretation of existing tax laws or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our tax returns by tax authorities will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
37
if we do not effectively expand and train our direct sales force, we may be unable to add new end customers or increase sales to our existing end customers, and our business will be adversely affected.
we depend on our direct sales force to obtain new end customers and increase sales with existing end customers. as such, we have invested and will continue to invest substantially in our sales organization. in recent periods, we have been adding personnel and other resources to our sales function as we focus on growing our business, entering new markets and increasing our market share, and we expect to incur significant additional expenses in expanding our sales personnel in order to achieve revenue growth. there is significant competition for sales personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require. our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training, retaining and integrating sufficient numbers of sales personnel to support our growth, particularly in international markets. new hires require significant training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity. our recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect, and we may be unable to hire, retain or integrate into our corporate culture sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business. in addition, because we continue to grow rapidly, a large percentage of our sales force is new to our company. if we are unable to hire, integrate and train a sufficient number of effective sales personnel, or the sales personnel we hire are not successful in obtaining new end customers or increasing sales to our existing end-customer base, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will be adversely affected.
new regulations related to conflict minerals may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the costs of certain metals used in the manufacturing of our products.
as a public company, we are subject to requirements under the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010, or the dodd-frank act, that will require us to perform diligence, and disclose and report whether or not our products contain conflict minerals. the implementation of these new requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of the materials used in the manufacture of components used in our products. in addition, we will incur additional costs to comply with these disclosure requirements, including costs related to conducting diligence procedures and, if applicable, potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. we may also face reputational harm if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict-free or if we are unable to alter our products, processes or sources of supply to avoid such materials.
risks related to the securities markets and ownership of our common stock the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, and the value of your investment could decline.
technology stocks have historically experienced high levels of volatility. since shares of our common stock were sold in our initial public offering in june 2014 at the price of $43.00 per share, our stock price has ranged from $43.00 per share to $94.84 per share through december 31, 2015. the trading price of our common stock has historically been and is likely to be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. these fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include the following:
•   actual or anticipated announcements of new products, services or technologies, commercial relationships, acquisitions or other events by us or our competitors;
•   forward looking statements related to future revenue, gross margins and earnings per share;
•   price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;
•   litigation involving us, our industry, or both including events occurring in our litigation with cisco systems and optumsoft;
•   significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of technology companies in general and of companies in the it security industry in particular;
•   fluctuations in the trading volume of our shares or the size of our public float;
•   sales by our officers, directors or significant stockholders;
•   actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of operations;
•   adverse changes to our relationships with any of our channel partners;
•   manufacturing, supply or distribution shortages;
•   whether our results of operations or our financial outlook for future fiscal periods meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors;
•   actual or anticipated changes in the expectations of investors or securities analysts;
•   regulatory developments in the u.s., foreign countries or both;
•   general economic conditions and trends;
•   major catastrophic events;
•   sales of large blocks of our common stock; or
•   departures of key personnel.
in addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence, the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition, results of operations and
38
prospects. the market price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. in the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. if the market price of our common stock is volatile, we may become the target of securities litigation. securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management's attention and resources from our business and prospects. this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets, or the perception that such sales might occur, could reduce the market price that our common stock might otherwise attain and may dilute your voting power and your ownership interest in us.
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and may make it more difficult for you to sell your common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate.
based on shares outstanding as of december 31, 2015, holders of up to approximately 21,270,434 shares, or 31.2%, of our common stock have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering the sale of their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. in addition, we have registered the offer and sale of all shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans. if holders, by exercising their registration rights, sell large numbers of shares, it could adversely affect our market price.
we may also issue shares of common stock or securities convertible into our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investments or otherwise. any such issuances would result in dilution to our existing stockholders and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.
insiders have substantial control over us, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including a change of control.
our directors, executive officers and each of our stockholders who own greater than 5% of our outstanding common stock together with their affiliates, in the aggregate, beneficially own approximately 43.8% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, based on shares outstanding as of december 31, 2015. as a result, these stockholders, if acting together, could exercise a significant level of influence over matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, acquisitions or other extraordinary transactions. they may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. this concentration of ownership may also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our common stock due to the limited voting power of such stock or otherwise may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock.
we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.
we have never declared nor paid any dividends on our common stock. we intend to retain any earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and prospects, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the future. as a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases.
if securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research reports about our business or prospects, the market price of our common stock and trading volume could decline.
the trading market for our common stock, to some extent, depends on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business or prospects. we do not have any control over these analysts. if one or more of the analysts who cover us should downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares, the market price of our common stock would likely decline. if one or more of these analysts should cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause the market price of our common stock or trading volume to decline.
our charter documents and delaware law could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment.
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. these provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors that are not nominated by the current members of our board of directors or take other corporate actions, including effecting changes in our management. these provisions include:
•   a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which could delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;
•   the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;
39
•   the exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;
•   a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;
•   the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of our board of directors, our president, our secretary or a majority vote of our board of directors, which could delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;
•   the requirement for the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the voting stock, voting together as a single class, to amend the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to the issuance of preferred stock and management of our business or our amended and restated bylaws, which may inhibit the ability of an acquirer to effect such amendments to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt;
•   the ability of our board of directors, by majority vote, to amend the bylaws, which may allow our board of directors to take additional actions to prevent an unsolicited takeover and inhibit the ability of an acquirer to amend the bylaws to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt; and
•   advance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders' meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer's own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.
in addition, as a delaware corporation, we are subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law. these provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time.
the issuance of additional stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our stock incentive plans or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders.
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock and up to 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may be determined by our board of directors. subject to compliance with applicable rules and regulations, we may issue our shares of common stock or securities convertible into our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investment, our stock incentive plans or otherwise. we may from time to time issue additional shares of common stock at a discount from the then market price of our common stock. any issuance of stock could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the market price of our common stock to decline.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k. this discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current plans, expectations and beliefs that involve risks and uncertainties. our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under "risk factors" and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k.
overview we are a leading supplier of cloud networking solutions that use software innovations to address the needs of large-scale internet companies, cloud service providers and next-generation data centers for enterprise support. our cloud networking solutions consist of our extensible operating system, or eos, a set of network applications and our ethernet switches. our cloud networking solutions deliver industry-leading performance, scalability, availability, programmability, automation and visibility. at the core of our cloud networking platform is eos, which was purpose-built to be fully programmable and highly modular. the programmability of eos has allowed us to create a set of software applications that address the requirements of cloud networking, including workflow automation, network visibility and analytics, and has also allowed us to rapidly integrate with a wide range of third-party applications for virtualization, management, automation, orchestration and network services.
we were founded in 2004 to address the limitations of legacy networking products and to create a cloud networking platform that is open and programmable. from 2004 to 2008, our activities were focused on the development of our software, which resulted in the commercial release of our first product, the 7100 series switches based on our eos software, in 2008. since then, we have continued to introduce new products utilizing eos, including our 7500 series switch and our 7050 series switch in 2010, the second generation of our 7500 series switch, called the 7500e modular switch, in may 2013, our 7300 series switch in november 2013, our 7280e in july 2014. in december 2014, we introduced our eos+ software platform for networking programmability and automation, and in june 2015 we introduced cloudvision, a network-wide approach for workload orchestration and workflow automation. in september 2015, we introduced our macro segmentation services ("mss") to provide automated insertion of security and other in-line layer 4-7 services within any software driven cloud networking infrastructure. mss has been endorsed by many of our technology alliance ecosystem partners with whom we are currently partnering with to deliver mss platform support. we also introduced our first 10/25/40/50/100g switches with our 7060, 7260 and 7320 series switches.
as of december 31, 2015, we have shipped more than five million switch ports. we have experienced rapid revenue growth over the last several years, increasing our revenue at a compound annual growth rate of 56.4% from 2011 to 2015. as we have grown the functionality of our eos software, expanded the range of our switching portfolio and increased the size of our sales force, our revenue has continued to grow rapidly. to support our customers and revenue growth, we have expanded our international presence to include 20 foreign subsidiaries as of december 31, 2015 including for example australia, canada, france, germany, india, ireland, japan, south korea and the united kingdom. our revenue for the year ended december 31, 2015 was $837.6 million an increase of 43.4%, compared to the same period in 2014. we have been profitable and cash flow positive for each year since 2010.
we believe that our cloud networking platform addresses the large and growing cloud networking segment of data center switching, which remains in the early stage of adoption. we expect to continue rapidly growing our organization to meet the needs of new and existing customers as they increasingly realize the performance and cost benefits of our cloud networking solutions and as they expand their cloud networks. we intend to continue to invest in our research and development organization to enhance the functionality of our existing cloud networking platform, introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership. we believe one of our greatest strengths lies in our rapid development of new features and applications. we intend to continue expanding our sales and marketing teams and programs and carrying out associated marketing activities in key geographies. in order to support our strong growth, we have and may continue to accelerate our investment in infrastructure, such as enterprise resource planning software and other technologies to improve the efficiency of our operations. as a result, our levels of operating profit as a percentage of revenue could decline in the short to medium term. for a description of factors that may impact our future performance, see the disclosure in the section titled "factors affecting our performance" below.
45
our business model we derive revenue from sales of products and services. we generate revenue primarily from sales of our switching products which incorporate our eos software. we generate the majority of our services revenue from post contract support, or pcs, which end customers typically purchase in conjunction with our products.
since shipping our first products in 2008, our cumulative end-customer base has grown rapidly. between december 31, 2011 and december 31, 2015, our cumulative end-customer base grew from approximately 1,100 to over 3,700. our end customers span a range of industries and include large internet companies, service providers, financial services organizations, government agencies, media and entertainment companies and others.
to continue to grow our revenue, it is important that we both obtain new customers and sell additional products to existing customers. our development model is focused on the development of new products based on our eos software and enhancements to eos. we engineer our products to be agnostic to the underlying merchant silicon architecture. today, we combine our eos software with merchant silicon into a family of switching products. this enables us to focus our research and development resources on our software core competencies and to leverage the investments made by merchant silicon vendors to achieve cost-effective solutions. we currently procure certain merchant silicon components from multiple vendors, and we continue to expand our relationships with these and other vendors. we work closely with third party contract manufacturers to manufacture our products. our contract manufacturers deliver our products to our third party direct fulfillment facilities where our eos software is installed on our products.  we and our fulfillment partners then perform labeling, final configuration, quality assurance testing and shipment to our customers.
we market and sell our products through both our direct sales force and our channel partners, including distributors, value-added resellers, system integrators, original equipment manufacturer, or "oem", partners and in conjunction with various technology partners. to facilitate channel coordination and increase productivity, we have created a partner program, the arista partner program, to engage partners who provide value-added services and extend our reach into the marketplace. authorized training partners provide technical training to our channel partners. our partners commonly receive an order from an end customer prior to placing an order with us, and we confirm the identification of the end customer prior to accepting such orders. our partners generally do not stock inventory received from us. our sales organization is supported by systems engineers with deep technical expertise and responsibility for pre-sales technical support and engineering for our end customers. each sales team is responsible for a geographic territory, has responsibility for a number of major direct end-customer accounts or has assigned accounts in a specific vertical market. during the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, 77.3%, 79.7%, and 82.9% of our revenue was generated from the americas, substantially all from the u.s., 15.3%, 12.8%, and 11.2% from europe, the middle east and africa and 7.4%, 7.5%, and 5.9% from the asia-pacific region, respectively.
factors affecting our performance we believe that our future success will depend on many factors, including our ability to expand sales to our existing customers as well as to add new end customers. while these areas present significant opportunity, they also present risks that we must manage to ensure successful results. see the section titled "risk factors." additionally, we face intense competition especially from larger, well-established companies, and we must continue to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform to succeed in our market. we are also currently engaged in lawsuits with cisco, our largest competitor whereby they claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights.  we intend to vigorously defend against these cisco lawsuits as summarized in the legal proceedings section below. however, we cannot be certain that any claims by cisco would be resolved in our favor.  if we are unable to address these challenges, our business could be adversely affected.
increasing adoption of cloud networks. networks are subject to increasing performance requirements due to growing numbers of connected devices as well as new enterprise and consumer applications. computing architectures are evolving to meet the need for constant connectivity and access to data and applications. we believe that cloud networks will continue to replace legacy network technologies. our business and results of operations will be significantly affected by the speed with which organizations implement cloud networks.
expanding sales to existing customer base. we expect that a substantial portion of our future sales will be follow-on sales to existing end customers. as noted above, one of our sales strategies is to target specific projects at our current end customers because they are familiar with the operational and economic benefits of our cloud networking solutions, thereby reducing the sales cycle into these customers. we believe this opportunity with current end customers to be significant given their existing and expected infrastructure spend. we expect our business and results of operations will depend on our ability to sell additional products to our growing base of customers.
adding new end customers. we believe that the cloud networking market is still in the early stages of adoption. we intend to target new end customers by continuing to invest in our field sales force and extending our relationships with channel, technology and system-level partners. to date, we have primarily targeted end customers with the largest cloud data centers. a typical initial order involves the education of prospective customers about the technical merits and capabilities and potential cost savings of our products as compared to our competitors' products. our results of operations will depend on our ability to continue to add new customers. we believe that
46
customer references have been, and will continue to be, an important factor in winning new business with special emphasis on four key verticals: the cloud titans, financial services, service and internet hosting providers and high tech enterprises.
selling more complex and higher-performance configurations. our results of operations have been, and we believe will continue to be, affected by our ability to sell more complex and higher-performance configurations of our products. our ability to sustain our revenue growth will depend, in part, upon our continued sales of these more robust configurations, and quarterly results of operations can be significantly impacted by the mix of products and product configurations sold during the period.
leveraging channel partners. we expect to continue to derive a growing portion of our sales through our channel partners as they develop new end customers and expand sales to our existing end customers. we plan to continue to invest in our network of channel partners to enable them to reach new end customers more effectively, increase sales to existing customers and provide services and support effectively. we believe that increasing channel leverage will extend and improve our engagement with a broad set of customers.
investing in research and development for growth. we believe that the market for cloud networking is still in the early stages of adoption and we intend to continue investing for long-term growth. we expect to continue to invest heavily in software development in order to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform, introduce new products including new releases and upgrades to our eos software and new applications building upon our technology leadership. we believe one of our greatest strengths lies in the speed of our product development efforts. by investing in research and development, we believe we will be well positioned to continue our rapid growth and take advantage of our large market opportunity. we expect that our results of operations will be impacted by the timing and size of these product development investments.
customer concentration and timing of large orders. historically, large purchases by a relatively limited number of end customers have accounted for significant portion of our revenue. during the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, our largest end customer accounted for 12.0%, 14.9%, and 21.9% of our revenue, respectively. we have also experienced and continue to experience customer concentration on a quarterly basis. in addition, we have experienced increases in the size of our orders, including orders from existing customers, which could result in future increased customer concentration, depending on the timing of the fulfillment of those orders. we have also experienced unpredictability in the timing of large orders, especially with respect to our large end customers, due to the complexity of orders, the time it takes end customers to evaluate, test, qualify and accept our products and factors specific to our end customers. due to these factors, we expect continued variability in our customer concentration and timing of sales on a quarterly and annual basis. in addition, we have provided, and may in the future provide, pricing discounts to large end customers, which may result in lower margins for the period in which such sales occur. our gross margins may also fluctuate as a result of the timing of such sales to large end customers.
47
basis of presentation revenue we generate revenue primarily from sales of our switching products which incorporate our eos software. we also derive a portion of our revenue from sales of post contract support, or pcs, and to a lesser extent professional services. we generate pcs revenue from sales of technical support services contracts that are typically purchased in conjunction with our products and subsequent renewals of those contracts. we offer pcs services under renewable, fee-based contracts, which include 24-hour technical support, hardware repair and replacement parts, bug fixes, patches and unspecified upgrades on a when-and-if available basis. we expect our revenue may vary from period to period based on, among other things, the timing and size of orders, the delivery and acceptance of products, the impact of significant transactions with unique terms and conditions that may require deferral of revenue and cyclicality of orders being placed by our customers. additionally, we expect pcs revenue to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our installed base. our ability to expand our installed base and increase our revenue is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. see the section titled "risk factors." we report revenue net of sales taxes.
cost of revenue cost of revenue primarily consists of amounts paid for inventory to our third-party contract manufacturers and merchant silicon vendors, overhead costs in our manufacturing operations department, and other manufacturing-related costs associated with manufacturing our products and managing our inventory. we expect our cost of product revenue to increase as our product revenue increases. cost of providing pcs and other services consists primarily of personnel costs for our global customer support organization. we expect our cost of service revenue to increase as our pcs revenue increases.
gross margin gross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including sales to large end customers who generally receive lower pricing, the average sales price of our offerings, manufacturing costs, merchant silicon costs and the mix of products sold. we expect our gross margins to fluctuate over time, depending on the factors described above and others. see the section titled "risk factors."
operating expenses our operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. the largest component of our operating expenses is personnel costs. personnel costs consist of wages, benefits, bonuses and, with respect to sales and marketing expenses, sales commissions. personnel costs also include stock-based compensation and travel expenses. we expect operating expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars in the near term as we continue to invest in the growth of our business.
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, with the remainder being prototype expenses, third-party engineering and contractor support costs, and an allocated portion of facility and it costs and depreciation. our research and development efforts are focused on maintaining and developing additional functionality for our existing products and on new product development, including new releases and upgrades to our eos software and applications. we expense research and development costs as incurred. we expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest heavily in software development in order to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform, introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership.
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and also include costs related to marketing and promotional activities, with the remainder being an allocated portion of facility and it costs and depreciation. we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our sales and marketing efforts worldwide and expand our relationships with current and future channel partners and end customers.
48
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, legal and professional fees, and an allocated portion of facility and it costs and depreciation. general and administrative personnel costs include those for our executive, finance, it, human resources and legal functions. our professional fees consist primarily of accounting, external legal and it and other consulting costs. refer to the discussion under "legal proceedings" subheading in note 5. commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for information related to pending litigation.
other income (expense), net interest expense interest expense consists of interest expense on our subordinated convertible promissory notes, including our related party subordinated convertible promissory notes which were converted during fiscal 2014 and interest expense from our lease financing obligation.
other income (expense)
other income (expense) consists of gains on investments, write-offs of debt discount on notes payable which were repaid and converted during fiscal 2014, and foreign currency exchange gains and losses. our foreign currency exchange gains and losses relate to transactions and asset and liability balances denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. we expect our foreign currency gains and losses to continue to fluctuate in the future due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
provision for income taxes we operate in a number of tax jurisdictions and are subject to taxes in each country or jurisdiction in which we conduct business. earnings from our non-u.s. activities are subject to local country income tax and may be subject to u.s. income tax. generally, our u.s. tax obligations are reduced by a credit for foreign income taxes paid on these earnings which avoids double taxation. our tax expense to date consists of federal, state and foreign current and deferred income taxes. as we expand internationally, our marginal tax rate may decrease; however, there can be no certainty that our marginal tax rate will decrease, and we may experience changes in tax rates that are not reflective of actual changes in our business or operations.
we account for income taxes under the liability approach for deferred income taxes, which requires recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements but have not been reflected in our taxable income. estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred income tax assets, which arise from temporary differences and carryforwards. we measure deferred income tax assets and liabilities using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be realized based on the positive and negative evidence available. we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize.
we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, although we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. the provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that we believe are appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.

revenue. product revenue increased 40.1% in the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to 2014. we increased shipments to our existing customers during the year as they continued to grow their businesses and increase their demand for our switch products and related accessories. in addition, we continued to add new customers as we expanded our market presence and geographic footprint. service revenue increased 76.4% in the year ended december 31, 2015 with growth in initial and renewal support contracts as our customer installed base continued to expand. we also continued to experience fluctuations in product and service pricing due to competitive market pressures. however, these were more than offset by the increased demand drivers outlined above.
cost of revenue and gross margin. gross margin decreased from 67.1% to 64.9% for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. this decrease in 2015 was primarily due to increased inventory-related obsolescence charges associated with upcoming product transitions and higher warranty costs, in addition to a greater mix of revenue from larger customers who typically receive higher discounts.

research and development. research and development expenses increased $60.5 million, or 40.7%, for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of $33.3 million, resulting from increases in headcount, stock based compensation as well as additional bonus expense under our corporate bonus plan. prototype spend and third-party engineering and consulting costs increased by $14.2 million, and facilities and it infrastructure costs increased $8.6 million due to new product introductions and the continued expansion and support of our research and development activities.
sales and marketing. sales and marketing expenses increased $23.7 million, or 27.8%, for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of $17.0 million, resulting from increased headcount and additional sales commissions. the increase also related to additional product field demonstration costs of $6.0 million.
general and administrative. general and administrative expenses increased $43.4 million, or 134.2%, for the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. the increase was due to an increase in legal fees of $39.8 million primarily related to the cisco and optumsoft legal matters outlined in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. in addition, personnel costs increased by $4.1 million reflecting additional bonus cost under our corporate bonus program and increased stock-based compensation charges during 2015.

interest expense. the reduction in interest expense during the year ended december 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 is primarily related to repayment and conversion of our notes payable upon closing of our initial public offering during the second quarter of 2014.
other income (expense), net. the unfavorable change in other income (expense), net during the year ended december 31, 2015, compared to the same period in 2014 was primarily due to a one-time gain on our notes receivable of $4.0 million in 2014, partially offset by a $0.7 million write-off related to the debt discount on notes payable during the second quarter of 2014, and a reduction in transactional exchange rate losses during 2015.

provision for income taxes was approximately $24.9 million and $34.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the change in our provision was the result of an increase in profit before income taxes, offset by a decrease due to foreign mix earnings taxed at a lower rate than the us tax rate, release of reserves due to expiration of the statute of limitations in certain domestic jurisdictions, and reinstatement of the federal research and development ("r&d") credit.
the r&d credit, which was made permanent under protecting americans from tax hikes (path) act, signed into law on december 18, 2015. the impact of the 2015 federal r&d tax credit benefit was recorded in the fourth quarter of the year ended december 31, 2015.

revenue. revenue increased $222.9 million, or 61.7%, for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to 2013. the increase in revenue was predominately driven by increased product shipments to existing customers due to increased demand for our switch products and related accessories. in addition, our cumulative number of customers grew approximately 33% from december 31, 2013 to december 31, 2014 as we continued to broaden our market penetration.
cost of revenue and gross margin. gross margin increased from 66.0% for the year ended december 31, 2013 to 67.1% for 2014. the increase in gross margin was primarily the result of specific warranty and excess and obsolete inventory-related charges of $10.3 million recorded in 2013 that did not recur in 2014. to a lesser extent, gross margin in 2014 was negatively impacted by a decrease in product margins due to a higher revenue mix from larger customers who typically receive higher volume discounts.

research and development. research and development expenses increased $50.3 million, or 51.0%, for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to 2013. the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of $39.0 million, resulting from an increase of 156 employees (a 34.1% increase) from december 31, 2013 to december 31, 2014, and additional bonus expenses under our corporate bonus plan. the increase was also due to an increase of $6.6 million in research and development related facilities and it infrastructure costs, and increases in third-party engineering costs of $5.9 million and depreciation expense of $2.0 million, as we continued to expand and support our research and development activities. these expenses were partially offset by a $4.3 million reduction in prototype spending related to project timing.
sales and marketing. sales and marketing expenses increased $30.2 million, or 54.8%, for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to 2013. the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of $23.4 million, resulting from an increase of 45 employees (a 23.0% increase) from december 31, 2013 to december 31, 2014, as well as an increase in sales commissions resulting from higher sales volume. the increase was also due to an increase of $3.7 million in product demonstrations, expenses incurred to expand our sales engineering labs to support our growing customer base, consulting expenses.
general and administrative. general and administrative expenses increased $13.6 million, or 73.0%, for the year ended december 31, 2014 compared to 2013. the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of $5.7 million, resulting from an increase of 17 employees (a 29.8% increase) from december 31, 2013 to december 31, 2014, and additional expenses under our corporate bonus plan. we also incurred higher professional service fees of $3.7 million related to outside legal, accounting and consulting services to support increased business activity, litigation and public-company activities. the increase was also attributable to higher insurance expense and franchise taxes of $1.5 million associated with being a public company, and a $1.0 million charitable donation through a fund established by the company in 2014.

the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2014 included the impact of the reinstatement of the 2014 r&d credit. the impact of the 2014 federal r&d tax credit benefit was recorded in the fourth quarter of the year ended december 31, 2014. the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2013 included the impact of the reinstatement of the 2013 and 2012 federal r&d tax credits.
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. as of december 31, 2015, cash and cash equivalents were $687.3 million, of which approximately $41.6 million was held outside the u.s. in our foreign subsidiaries. we have not repatriated nor do we currently have plans to repatriate these funds, but if we were to repatriate cash held outside of the u.s. for domestic cash operations, we would be required to accrue and pay u.s. income taxes to repatriate these funds less any previously paid foreign income taxes. we consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31, 2015 to be indefinitely reinvested, and, accordingly, no u.s. income taxes have been provided thereon.
our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. we plan to continue to invest for long-term growth. we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents together with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and our growth strategies for the foreseeable future. our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of our spending to support research and development activities, the timing and cost of establishing additional sales and marketing capabilities, the introduction of new and enhanced product and service offerings, our costs and access to outsourcing our manufacturing, our costs related to investing in or acquiring complementary or strategic businesses and technologies, the continued market acceptance of our products, and costs incurred related to outstanding litigation claims. if we require or elect to seek additional capital through debt or equity financing in the future, we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. if we are required and unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.

cash flows from operating activities our primary source of cash from operating activities has been from cash collections from our customers. we expect cash inflows from operating activities to be affected by increased sales and timing of collections. our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel costs, inventory purchases from our contract manufacturer, investment in research and development, and litigation expenses.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, cash provided by operating activities was $200.5 million, primarily from net income of $121.1 million, net non-cash charges of ($1.2) million, and a net increase in cash from changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $80.6 million. the net increase in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in deferred revenue of $90.3 million, largely related to short and long-term services contracts and product revenue deferrals related to contracts with acceptance terms. in addition, we experienced an increase in cash of $32.0 million from income taxes payable and an increase in our accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $29.4 million due to the timing of payments. these operating liability increases were offset by an increase in our accounts receivable of $47.3 million resulting from an increase in sales during the period. in addition, inventory increased $14.1 million during the period due to higher shipment volume, and prepaid expenses and current assets increased $7.8 million in the period.
during the year ended december 31, 2014, cash provided by operating activities was $131.9 million primarily from net income of $86.9 million, net non-cash charges of $11.0 million, and an increase of $33.2 million due to changes in our operating assets and
55
liabilities. the increase in cash from operating assets and liabilities was primarily due an increase in deferred revenue of $47.6 million resulting from the increase in sales, an increase in accrued liabilities of $18.9 million largely related to our payroll and corporate bonus plan and an increase in accounts payable of $14.0 million due to the timing of our payments, partially offset by a reduction in cash from an increase in accounts receivable of $19.0 million from higher products shipments, an increase in inventories of $13.4 million to meet our customer demand, an increase of $15.3 million in cash paid for income taxes, and supplier rebates receivable resulting from our increased inventory purchases.
during the year ended december 31, 2013, cash provided by operating activities was $34.6 million, primarily from net income of $42.5 million and non-cash charges of $6.6 million, partially offset by a decrease of $14.6 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities. the decrease in cash from operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $49.2 million increase in inventory for anticipated growth in our business, a $28.1 million increase in accounts receivable due to an increase in sales partially offset by an increase in cash from a $3.0 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by an increase in cash from a $3.9 million increase in accounts payable primarily attributable to the timing of payments, a $12.0 million increase in accrued liabilities attributable to higher warranty liabilities and higher accrued personnel costs due to growth in headcount, a $34.1 million increase in deferred revenue due to increased sales and a $6.0 million increase in interest payable attributable to our outstanding convertible promissory notes, including our related party convertible promissory notes.
cash flows from investing activities our investing activities have consisted primarily of capital expenditures and net investment purchases of available for sale marketable securities. we expect to continue investing in these activities to support the continued growth of our business.
during the year ended december 31, 2015, cash provided by investing activities was $184.2 million, consisting of proceeds from the maturity of available-for-sale securities of $208.2 million, offset by purchases of property, equipment and other assets of $19.2 million and increase in restricted cash of $4.0 million related to a security deposit required for a facility lease.
during the year ended december 31, 2014, cash used in investing activities was $249.4 million, consisting primarily of purchases of marketable securities of $210.0 million, purchases of property and equipment of $13.1 million and other investing activities of $38.2 million largely due to a $33.6 million equity investments in privately held companies, partially offset by the proceeds of the repayments of our notes receivable of $8.0 million and the release of our restricted cash into cash and cash equivalents of $4.0 million.
during the year ended december 31, 2013, cash used in investing activities was $19.5 million, of which $20.3 million relates to the purchase of property and equipment offset by notes receivable repayments of $1.0 million.
cash flows from financing activities during the year ended december 31, 2015, cash provided by financing activities was $63.1 million, consisting primarily of the excess tax benefit associated with equity incentive plans of $37.3 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options, net of repurchases of $17.8 million and the proceeds from the issuance of common stock from our espp of $9.4 million.
during the year ended december 31, 2014, cash provided by financing activities was $244.0 million, consisting primarily of net proceeds raised from our initial public offering of $239.3 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options, net of repurchases of $8.0 million and excess tax benefits from our equity incentive plans amounting to $17.4 million. these proceeds were partially offset by the repayment of our notes payable of $20.0 million.

off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2015, we did not have any relationships with any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
contractual obligations and commitments our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. our contractual obligations represent material expected or contractually committed future obligations with terms in excess of one year. we believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and from our existing cash balances.

critical accounting policies and estimates we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap and include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries. the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the applicable periods. we base our estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, which, in turn, could change the results from those reported. we evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis. the critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are the following:
revenue recognition we generate revenue from sales of switching products which incorporate our eos software and accessories such as cables and optics to direct customers and channel partners together with post contract customer support ("pcs"). we typically sell products and pcs in a single transaction. we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery or performance has occurred; the sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.
we define each of the four criteria above as follows:
•   persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. evidence of an arrangement consists of stand-alone purchase orders or purchase orders issued pursuant to the terms and conditions of a master sales agreement. it is our practice to identify an end customer prior to shipment to a reseller or distributor.
•   delivery or performance has occurred. we use shipping documents or written evidence of customer acceptance, when applicable, to verify delivery or performance. we recognize product revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss, which primarily is upon shipment to customers. we generally do not have significant obligations for future performance, rights of return, or pricing credits associated with our product sales. in instances where substantive acceptance provisions are specified in the customer arrangement, revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met.
•   the sales price is fixed or determinable. we assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment.
•   collectability is reasonably assured. we assess probability of collectability on a customer-by-customer basis. our customers and channel partners are subjected to a credit review process that evaluates their financial condition and ability to pay for products and services.
pcs is offered under renewable, fee-based contracts, which includes technical support, hardware repair and replacement parts beyond standard warranty, bug fixes, patches and unspecified upgrades on a when-and-if-available basis. we initially defer pcs revenue and recognize it ratably over the life of the pcs contract, with the related expenses recognized as incurred. pcs contracts usually have a term of one to three years. we include billed but unearned pcs revenue in deferred revenue.
we report revenue net of sales taxes. we include shipping charges billed to customers in revenue and the related shipping costs are included in cost of goods sold.
multiple-element arrangements most of our arrangements, other than renewals of pcs, are multiple element arrangements with a combination of products and pcs. products and pcs generally qualify as separate units of accounting. our hardware deliverables include eos software, which together deliver the essential functionality of our products. for multiple element arrangements, we allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price. the relative selling price for each element is based upon the following hierarchy: vendor-specific
57
objective evidence ("vsoe"), if available; third-party evidence ("tpe"), if vsoe is not available; and best estimate of selling price ("besp"), if neither vsoe nor tpe is available. as we have not been able to establish vsoe or tpe for our products and most of our services, we generally utilize besp for the purposes of allocating revenue to each unit of accounting.
•   vsoe-we determine vsoe based on our historical pricing and discounting practices for the specific products and services when sold separately. in determining vsoe, we require that a substantial majority of the stand-alone selling prices fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range.
•   tpe-when vsoe cannot be established for deliverables in multiple-element arrangements, we apply judgment with respect to whether we can establish a selling price based on tpe. tpe is determined based on competitor prices for interchangeable products or services when sold separately to similarly situated customers. however, as our products contain a significant element of proprietary technology and offer substantially different features and functionality, the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality typically cannot be obtained. additionally, as we are unable to reliably determine what competitors products' selling prices are on a stand-alone basis, we are not able to obtain reliable evidence of tpe of selling price.
•   besp-when we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe, we use besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration. the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service was sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. besp is based on considering multiple factors including, but not limited to the sales channel (reseller, distributor or end customer), the geographies in which our products and services were sold (domestic or international) and size of the end customer.
we limit the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services, future performance obligations, or subject to customer-specific return, acceptance or refund privileges.
we account for multiple agreements with a single partner as 1 arrangement if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single arrangement.
we may occasionally accept returns to address customer satisfaction issues even though there is no contractual provision for such returns. we estimate returns for sales to customers based on historical returns rates applied against current-period gross revenues. specific customer returns and allowances are considered when determining our sales return reserve estimate.
inventory valuation and contract manufacturer/supplier liabilities inventories primarily consist of finished goods purchased from third party contract manufacturers and are stated at the lower of cost (computed using the first-in, first-out method) or market value. manufacturing overhead costs and inbound shipping costs are included in the cost of inventory.  in addition, we purchase strategic component inventory from certain suppliers under purchase commitments that in some cases are non-cancelable, including integrated circuits, which are held by our contract manufacturers.  we record a provision when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand, or obsolete, to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value.  we also record a liability for non-cancelable, non-returnable purchase commitments with our component inventory suppliers for quantities in excess of our demand forecasts or that are considered obsolete.
our contract manufacturers procure components and assemble products on our behalf based on our forecasts.  we generally incur a liability when the contract manufacturer has converted the component inventory to a finished product.  historically, we have reimbursed our contract manufacturer for component inventory that has been rendered excess or obsolete due to manufacturing and engineering change orders resulting from design changes, or in cases where inventory levels greatly exceed our forecasts.
we use significant judgment in establishing our forecasts of future demand and obsolete material exposures. these estimates depend on our assessment of current and expected orders from our customers, product development plans and current sales levels. if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, which may be caused by factors within and outside of our control, we may be required to increase our inventory write-downs and liabilities to our contract manufacturers and suppliers, which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability. we regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs and adequacy of our contract manufacturer liabilities.
warranty we offer a one-year warranty on all of our hardware products and a 90-day warranty against defects in the software embedded in the products. we use judgment and estimates when determining warranty costs based on historical costs to replace product returns within the warranty period at the time we recognize revenue. we accrue for potential warranty claims at the time of shipment as a component of cost of revenues based on historical experience and other relevant information. we reserve for specifically identified products if and when we determine we have a systemic product failure. although we engage in extensive product quality programs, if actual product failure rates or use of materials differ from estimates, additional warranty costs may be incurred, which could reduce our gross margin. the accrued warranty liability is recorded in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
stock-based compensation compensation expense related to stock-based transactions, including stock options, restricted stock units ("rsus"), restricted
58
stock awards ("rsas"), and stock purchase rights under our employee stock purchase program is measured and recognized in the financial statements based on the estimated fair value of the equity granted. stock-based compensation expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service periods of the awards, which typically ranges from two to five years. the assumptions used in our option-pricing model represent management's best estimates. these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. if factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. these assumptions and estimates are as follows:
fair value of common stock the fair value of each stock-based award and option is estimated on the grant date using the black-scholes-merton option-pricing model. this model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the option, the expected volatility of the price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. rsus are measured based on the fair market values of the underlying stock on the dates of grant. prior to our initial public offering, we estimated the fair value of common stock, based on numerous subjective and objective factors at each grant date.
expected term the expected term represents the period that our equity grants are expected to be outstanding. for option grants that are considered to be "simple," we used the simplified method to determine the expected term which calculates the expected term as the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options. for option grants that are not considered "simple," the expected term is based on historical option exercise behavior and post-vesting cancellations of options by employees. for espp grants, the expected term is based on the length of the offering period, which is typically 24 months.
expected volatility the volatility is derived from the average historical stock volatilities of a peer group of public companies within our industry that we consider to be comparable to our business over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock-based grants. we intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar public companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own common stock share price becomes available, or unless circumstances change such that the identified companies are no longer similar to us, in which case, more suitable companies whose share prices are publicly available would be utilized in the calculation.
risk-free interest rate the risk-free interest rate is based on the u.s. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for zero-coupon u.s. treasury notes with maturities approximately equal or equivalent to the option's remaining expected term.
dividend yield the expected dividend assumption is based on our current expectations about our anticipated dividend policy. we have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. consequently, we used an expected dividend yield of zero.
in addition to the assumptions used above, we must also estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate the stock-based compensation expense for our awards. our forfeiture rate is based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures. we continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee turnover and other factors. changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant impact on our stock-based compensation expense as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. we will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our stock-based compensation on a prospective basis. as we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may refine our estimates, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.
income taxes income tax expense is an estimate of current income taxes payable in the current fiscal year based on reported income before income taxes. deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences and carryforwards that we recognize for financial reporting and income tax purposes.
we account for income taxes under the liability approach for deferred income taxes, which requires recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements, but have not been reflected in our taxable income. estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred income tax assets, which arise from temporary differences and carryforwards. deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be realized based on the positive and negative evidence available. we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize.
59
we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, although we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. the provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that we believe are appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.
we regularly review our tax positions and benefits to be realized. we recognize tax liabilities based upon our estimate of whether, and to the extent to which, additional taxes will be due when such estimates are more likely than not to be sustained. an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as income tax expense.
loss contingencies in the ordinary course of business, we are a party to claims and legal proceedings including matters relating to commercial, employee relations, business practices and intellectual property. in assessing loss contingencies, we use significant judgment and assumptions to estimate the likelihood of loss, impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss. we record a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. we will record a charge equal to the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met: (i) information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (ii) the range of loss can be reasonably estimated. we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required.

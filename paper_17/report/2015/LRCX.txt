item 1a.   risk factors in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10-k ("2015 form 10-k"), the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business because such factors may significantly impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. as a result of these risk factors, as well as other risks discussed in our other sec filings, our actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. no priority or significance is intended, nor should be attached, to the order in which the risk factors appear.
the semiconductor capital equipment industry is subject to variability and, as a result, we face risks related to our strategic resource allocation decisions despite the recent reduction in cyclicality, the semiconductor capital equipment industry has historically been characterized by rapid changes in demand. the industry environment has moved toward an environment more characterized by variability across segments and customers accentuated by consolidation within the industry. variability in our customers' business plans may lead to changes in demand for our equipment and services which could negatively impact our results. the variability in our customers' investments during any particular period is dependent on several factors including but not limited to electronics demand, economic conditions (both general and in the semiconductor and electronics industries), industry supply and demand, prices for semiconductors, and our customers' ability to develop and manufacture increasingly complex and costly semiconductor devices. the changes in demand may require our management to adjust spending and other resources allocated to operating activities.
during periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services, we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems, procedures for training and managing our work force, and in appropriately sizing our supply chain infrastructure,
13
work force, and other components of our business on a timely basis. if we do not adequately meet these challenges during periods of demand decline, our gross margins and earnings may be negatively impacted.
we continuously reassess our strategic resource allocation choices in response to the changing business environment. if we do not adequately adapt to the changing business environment, we may lack the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during a period of growth, or we may expand our capacity too rapidly and/or beyond what is appropriate for the actual demand environment.
especially during transitional periods, resource allocation decisions can have a significant impact on our future performance, particularly if we have not accurately anticipated industry changes. our success will depend, to a significant extent, on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively.
future declines in the semiconductor industry, and the overall world economic conditions on which it is significantly dependent, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers, which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for ics. with the consolidation of customers within the industry the semiconductor capital equipment market may experience rapid changes in demand driven both by changes in the market generally and the plans and requirements of particular customers. global economic and business conditions, which are often unpredictable, have historically impacted customer demand for our products and normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers, and creditors. additionally, in times of economic uncertainty our customers' budgets for our products, or their ability to access credit to purchase them, could be adversely affected. this would limit their ability to purchase our products and services. as a result, economic downturns can cause material adverse changes to our results of operations and financial condition including, but not limited to:
   a decline in demand for our products or services;
   an increase in reserves on accounts receivable due to our customers' inability to pay us;
   an increase in reserves on inventory balances due to excess or obsolete inventory as a result of our inability to sell such inventory;
   valuation allowances on deferred tax assets;
   restructuring charges;
   asset impairments including the potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets;
   a decline in the value of our investments;
   exposure to claims from our suppliers for payment on inventory that is ordered in anticipation of customer purchases that do not come to fruition;
   a decline in the value of certain facilities we lease to less than our residual value guarantee with the lessor; and
   challenges maintaining reliable and uninterrupted sources of supply.
fluctuating levels of investment by semiconductor manufacturers may materially affect our aggregate shipments, revenues, operating results, and earnings. where appropriate, we will attempt to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams, which sometimes result in restructuring charges. even during periods of reduced revenues, we must continue to invest in r&d and maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive, which may temporarily harm our profitability and other financial results.
14
our quarterly revenues and operating results are variable our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, not all of which are in our control. we manage our expense levels based in part on our expectations of future revenues. because our operating expenses are based in part on anticipated future revenues, and a certain amount of those expenses are relatively fixed, a change in the timing of recognition of revenue and/or the level of gross profit from a small number of transactions can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter. factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include, but are not limited to:
   economic conditions in the electronics and semiconductor industries in general and specifically the semiconductor equipment industry;
   the size and timing of orders from customers;
   consolidation of the customer base may result in the investment decisions of one customer or market to having a significant effect on demand for our products or services;
   procurement shortages;
   the failure of our suppliers or outsource providers to perform their obligations in a manner consistent with our expectations;
   manufacturing difficulties;
   customer cancellations or delays in shipments, installations, and/or customer acceptances;
   the extent that customers continue to purchase and use our products and services in their business;
   our customers' reuse of existing and installed products, to the extent that such reuse decreases their need to purchase new products or services;
   changes in average selling prices, customer mix, and product mix;
   our ability in a timely manner to develop, introduce and market new, enhanced, and competitive products;
   our competitors' introduction of new products;
   legal or technical challenges to our products and technology;
   transportation, communication, demand, information technology or supply disruptions based on factors outside our control such as strikes, acts of god, wars, terrorist activities, and natural or man-made disasters;
   legal, tax, accounting, or regulatory changes (including but not limited to change in import/export regulations) or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing requirements;
   changes in our estimated effective tax rate;
   foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and
   convertibility and the dilutive impact of our convertible notes and related warrants on our earnings per share.
we may incur impairments to goodwill or long-lived assets we review our long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets, for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. negative industry or economic trends, including reduced market prices of our common stock, reduced estimates of future cash flows, disruptions to our business, slower growth rates, or lack of growth in our relevant business units, could lead to impairment charges against our long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets. if, in any period, our stock price decreases to the point where our fair value, as determined by our market capitalization, is less than the book value of our assets, this could also indicate a potential impairment, and we may be required to record an impairment charge in that period, which could adversely affect our result of operations. during the 2015 fiscal year, our goodwill and long-lived asset impairment assessments resulted in an impairment charge of $79.4 million associated with the single-wafer clean reporting unit and $9.8 million related to an intangible asset.
15
our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance. we operate in a highly competitive environment and projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results. additionally, if our analysis indicates potential impairment to goodwill in one or more of our business units, we may be required to record additional charges to earnings in our financial statements, which could negatively affect our results of operations.
our leverage and debt service obligations and potential note conversion or related hedging activities may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and earnings per share as a result of the issuance of our 2020 and 2025 senior notes, our 2016 and 2018 convertible notes, and the assumption of the 2041 convertible notes in connection with our acquisition of novellus systems, inc. (collectively the "notes"), we have a greater amount of debt than we have maintained in the past. furthermore, in march 2014, we entered into an unsecured credit agreement providing us with the ability to borrow up to $300 million (and, under certain circumstances, to increase such availability to $500 million). we may, in the future, decide to borrow amounts under this facility, or to enter into additional debt arrangements.
in addition, we have entered, and in the future may enter, into derivative instrument arrangements to hedge against the variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate of fixed rate debt. we could be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our derivative instruments.
our maintenance of higher levels of indebtedness could have adverse consequences including:
   increased risk associated with any inability to satisfy our obligations;
   increasing the portion of our cash flows that may have to be dedicated to interest and principal payments and may not be available for operations, working capital, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes; and
   impairing our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.
our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory, and other factors. furthermore, our operations may not generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to meet our expenses and service our debt. as a result, we may need to enter into new financing arrangements to obtain the necessary funds. if we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason, we may not be able to obtain such funding or, if funding is available, obtain it on acceptable terms. if we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt, and this default could cause us to be in default on our other outstanding indebtedness.
conversion of our convertible notes and resulting exercise of the related warrants may cause dilution to our stockholders and to our earnings per share. the number of shares of our common stock into which the convertible notes are convertible for and the related warrants are exercisable for may be adjusted from time to time, including increases in such rates as a result of dividends that we pay to our stockholders. upon conversion of any convertible notes, we will deliver cash in the amount of the principal amount of the convertible notes and, with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the convertible notes, shares of our common stock, which would result in dilution to our stockholders. this dilution may be mitigated to some extent by the hedging transactions we entered into in connection with the sale of the 2016 and 2018 notes or through share repurchases. prior to the maturity of the convertible notes, if the price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price, u.s. generally accepted accounting principles require that we report an increase in diluted share count, which would result in lower reported earnings per share. the price of our common stock could also be affected by sales of our common stock by investors who view the convertible notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in our company and also by hedging activity that may develop involving our common stock by holders of the convertible notes.
16
our credit agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business.
we may be unable to respond to changes in business and economic conditions, engage in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us, or obtain additional financing, because our debt agreements contain, and any of our other future similar agreements may contain, covenant restrictions that limit our ability to, among other things:
   incur additional debt, assume obligations in connection with letters of credit, or issue guarantees;
   create liens;
   enter into transactions with our affiliates;
   sell certain assets; and
   merge or consolidate with any person.
our ability to comply with these covenants is dependent on our future performance, which will be subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including prevailing economic conditions. in addition, our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the senior notes, the convertible notes or our other debt, which could permit the holders to accelerate such debt. if any of our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt, which could materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operation.
we have a limited number of key customers sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue, shipments, cash flows, collections, and profitability. for the years ended june 29, 2015, june 28, 2014 and june 30, 2013, three customers accounted for 51%, 52%, and 45% of total revenue, respectively. as a result, the actions of even one customer may subject us to variability in those areas that are difficult to predict. in addition, large customers may be able to negotiate requirements that result in decreased pricing; increased costs and/or lower margins for us; compliance to specific environmental, social and corporate governance standards; and limitations on our ability to share jointly developed technology with others. similarly, significant portions of our credit risk may, at any given time, be concentrated among a limited number of customers, so that the failure of even one of these key customers to pay its obligations to us could significantly impact our financial results.
we depend on creating new products and processes and enhancing existing products and processes for our success. consequently, we are subject to risks associated with rapid technological change rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances that enable those processes. we believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products. if new products or existing products have reliability, quality, design, or safety problems, our performance may be impacted by reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance of and payment for new products, and additional service and warranty expenses. we may be unable to develop and manufacture products successfully, or products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace. for over 25 years the primary driver of technology advancement in the semiconductor industry has been to shrink the lithography that prints the circuit design on semiconductor chips. that driver could be approaching its technological limit, leading semiconductor manufacturers to investigate more complex changes in multiple technologies in an effort to continue technology development. in the face of uncertainty on which technology solutions will become successful, we will need to focus our efforts on developing the technology changes that are ultimately successful in supporting our customer requirements. our failure to develop and offer the correct technology solutions in a timely manner with productive and cost-effective products could adversely affect our business in a material way. our failure to commercialize new products in a timely manner could result in loss of market share, unanticipated costs, and inventory obsolescence, which would adversely affect our financial results.
17
in order to develop new products and processes and enhance existing products and processes, we expect to continue to make significant investments in r&d and to pursue joint development relationships with customers, suppliers, or other members of the industry. we must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully, as the introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products and certain jointly developed technologies may be subject to restrictions on our ability to share that technology with other customers, which could limit our market for products incorporating those technologies. future technologies, processes or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete, leaving us with non-competitive products, or obsolete inventory, or both. moreover, customers may adopt new technologies or processes to address the complex challenges associated with next generation devices. this shift may result in a reduction in the size of our addressable markets or could increase the relative size of markets in which we either do not compete or have relatively low market share.
we are subject to risks relating to product concentration and lack of product revenue diversification we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products. system sales constitute a significant portion of our total revenue. our systems are priced up to approximately $9 million per system, and our revenues in any given quarter are dependent upon customer acceptance of a limited number of systems. as a result, the inability to recognize revenue on even a few systems can cause a significantly adverse impact on our revenues for a given quarter, and, in the longer term, the continued market acceptance of these products is critical to our future success. our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by:
   a decline in demand for even a limited number of our products;
   a failure to achieve continued market acceptance of our key products;
   export restrictions or other regulatory or legislative actions that could limit our ability to sell those products to key customers or customers within certain markets;
   an improved version of products being offered by a competitor in the markets in which we participate;
   increased pressure from competitors that offer broader product lines;
   technological changes that we are unable to address with our products; or
   a failure to release new or enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis.
in addition, the fact that we offer limited product lines creates the risk that our customers may view us as less important to their business than our competitors that offer additional products. this may impact our ability to maintain or expand our business with certain customers. such product concentration may also subject us to additional risks associated with technology changes. our business is affected by our customers' use of our products in certain steps in their wafer fabrication processes. should technologies change so that the manufacture of semiconductors requires fewer steps using our products, this could have a larger impact on our business than it would on the business of our less concentrated competitors.
strategic alliances and customer consolidation may have negative effects on our business increasingly, semiconductor manufacturing companies are entering into strategic alliances or consolidating with one another to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies and/or achieve economies of scale. the outcomes of such an alliance can be the definition of a particular tool set for a certain function and/or the standardization of a series of process steps that use a specific set of manufacturing equipment; while the outcomes of consolidation can lead to an overall reduction in the market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment as customers' operations achieve economies of scale and/or increased purchasing power based on their higher volumes. in certain instances, this could work to our disadvantage if a competitor's tools or equipment become the standard equipment for such functions or processes. additional outcomes of such consolidation may include our customers re-evaluating their future supplier relationships to consider other competitors' products and/or gaining additional influence over the pricing of products and the control of intellectual property.
18
similarly, our customers may partner with, or follow the lead of, educational or research institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps. if those institutions utilize a competitor's equipment when they establish those processes, it is likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing lines. even if they select our equipment, the institutions and the customers that follow their lead could impose conditions on acceptance of that equipment, such as adherence to standards and requirements or limitations on how we license our proprietary rights that increase our costs or require us to take on greater risk. these actions could adversely impact our market share and financial results.
we depend on a limited number of key suppliers and outsource providers, and we run the risk that they might not perform as we expect outsource providers and component suppliers have played and will continue to play a key role in our manufacturing operations and in many of our transactional and administrative functions, such as information technology, facilities management, and certain elements of our finance organization. these providers and suppliers might suffer financial setbacks, be acquired by third parties, become subject to exclusivity arrangements that preclude further business with us or be unable to meet our requirements or expectation due to their independent business decisions, or force majeure events that could interrupt or impair their continued ability to perform as we expect.
although we attempt to select reputable providers and suppliers, and we attempt to secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts, it is possible that one or more of these providers or suppliers could fail to perform as we expect, or fail to secure or protect intellectual property rights, and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business. in some cases, the requirements of our business mandate that we obtain certain components and sub-assemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. where practical, we endeavor to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any single provider or supplier will adversely affect our business, but this is not feasible in all circumstances. there is therefore a risk that a prolonged inability to obtain certain components or secure key services could impair our ability to manage operations, ship products and generate revenues, which could adversely affect our operating results and damage our customer relationships.
we face risks related to the disruption of our primary manufacturing facilities our manufacturing facilities are concentrated in just a few locations. these locations are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons such as natural or man-made disasters, terrorist activities, disruptions of our information technology resources, and utility interruptions. such disruptions may cause delays in shipping our products which could result in the loss of business or customer trust, adversely affecting our business and operating results.
once a semiconductor manufacturer commits to purchase a competitor's semiconductor manufacturing equipment, the manufacturer typically continues to purchase that competitor's equipment, making it more difficult for us to sell our equipment to that customer semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line. we believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier's processing equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time, especially if customers are more focused on tool re-use than in the past. accordingly, we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitor's equipment for the same product line application.
we face a challenging and complex competitive environment we face significant competition from multiple competitors and with increased consolidation efforts in our industry we may face increasing competitive pressures. other companies continue to develop systems and products that are competitive to ours and may introduce new products, which may affect our ability to sell our existing products.
19
we face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop, as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers.
we believe that to remain competitive we must devote significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to invest in product and process r&d. certain of our competitors, including those that are created and financially backed by foreign governments, have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to offer customers a more comprehensive array of products and to therefore achieve additional relative success in the semiconductor equipment industry. these competitors may deeply discount or give away products similar to those that we sell, challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar accommodations and threatening our ability to sell those products. we also face competition from our own customers, who in some instances have established affiliated entities that manufacture equipment similar to ours. for these reasons, we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide.
in addition, our competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. in particular, while we continue to develop product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements, we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully, or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive. accordingly, competition may intensify, and we may be unable to continue to compete successfully in our markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.
our future success depends heavily on international sales and the management of global operations non-u.s. sales accounted for approximately 83%, 86%, and 80% of total revenue in fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. we expect that international sales will continue to account for a substantial majority of our total revenue in future years.
we are subject to various challenges related to international sales and the management of global operations including, but not limited to:
   trade balance issues;
   tariffs and other barriers;
   global or national economic and political conditions;
   changes in currency controls;
   differences in the enforcement of intellectual property and contract rights in varying jurisdictions;
   our ability to respond to customer and foreign government demands for locally sourced systems, spare parts and services and develop the necessary relationships with local suppliers;
   compliance with u.s. and international laws and regulations affecting foreign operations; including u.s. and international trade restrictions and sanctions, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, environmental, and labor laws;
   fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates;
   our ability to repatriate cash in a tax-efficient manner;
   the need for technical support resources in different locations; and
   our ability to secure and retain qualified people, and effectively manage people, in all necessary locations for the successful operation of our business.
certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses from the u.s. government. our failure or inability to obtain such licenses would substantially limit our markets and severely restrict our revenues. many of
20
the challenges noted above are applicable in china, which is a fast developing market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore an area of potential significant growth for our business. as the business volume between china and the rest of the world grows, there is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships among china, taiwan, japan, south korea, and the united states, that political and diplomatic influences might lead to trade disruptions. this would adversely affect our business with china, taiwan, japan, and/or south korea and perhaps the entire asia pacific region. a significant trade disruption in these areas could have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits. in addition, there are risks that the chinese government may, among other things: insist on the use of local suppliers; compel companies that do business in china to partner with local companies to design and supply equipment on a local basis, requiring the transfer of intellectual property rights and/or local manufacturing; and provide special incentives to government-backed local customers to buy from local competitors, even if their products are inferior to ours; all of which could adversely impact our revenues and margins.
we are exposed to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in u.s. dollars. however, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to revenues denominated in japanese yen and expenses denominated in euro and korean won. currently, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short-term impact of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities; primarily third party accounts receivables, accounts payables and intercompany receivables and payables. in addition, we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows, primarily anticipated revenues denominated in japanese yen and euro-denominated and korean won-denominated expenses. we believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation. we expect to continue to enter into hedging transactions, for the purposes outlined, for the foreseeable future. however, these hedging transactions may not achieve their desired effect because differences between the actual timing of the underlying exposures and our forecasts of those exposures may leave us either over-or under-hedged on any given transaction. moreover, by hedging these foreign currency denominated revenues, expenses, monetary assets and liabilities with foreign currency forward contracts, we may miss favorable currency trends that would have been advantageous to us but for the hedges. additionally, we are exposed to short-term foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on non-u.s. dollar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities (other than those currency exposures previously discussed) and currently we do not enter into foreign currency hedge contracts against these exposures. therefore, we are subject to both favorable and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that we transact business (including intercompany transactions) for these currencies.
the magnitude of our overseas business also affects where our cash is generated. certain uses of cash, such as share repurchases, payment of dividends or the repayment of our notes, can usually only be made with on-shore cash balances. since the majority of our cash is generated outside of the united states, this may impact certain business decisions and adversely affect business outcomes.
our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key employees is critical to our success our ability to compete successfully depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key employees. this is an ongoing challenge due to intense competition for top talent, as well as fluctuations in industry economic conditions that may require cycles of hiring activity and workforce reductions. our success in hiring depends on a variety of factors, including the attractiveness of our compensation and benefit programs and our ability to offer a challenging and rewarding work environment. we periodically evaluate our overall compensation programs and make adjustments, as appropriate, to maintain or enhance their competitiveness. if we are not able to successfully attract, retain, and motivate key employees, we may be unable to capitalize on market opportunities and our operating results may be materially and adversely affected.
we rely upon certain critical information systems for the operation of our business we maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business. these information systems include telecommunications, the internet, our corporate intranet, various computer hardware and software applications, network communications, and e-mail. these information systems may be owned and
21
maintained by us, our outsourced providers or third parties such as vendors and contractors. many of these information systems and outsourced service providers, including certain hosted software applications that we use for confidential data storage, employ "cloud computing" technology for such storage (which refers to an information technology hosting and delivery system in which data is not stored within the user's physical infrastructure but instead is delivered to and consumed by the user as an internet-based service). all of these information systems are subject to attacks, failures, and access denials from a number of potential sources including viruses, destructive or inadequate code, power failures, and physical damage to computers, hard drives, communication lines, and networking equipment. confidential and/or sensitive information stored on these information systems or transmitted to or from cloud storage could be intentionally or unintentionally compromised, lost and/or stolen. while we have implemented security procedures, such as virus protection software and emergency recovery processes, to mitigate the outlined risks with respect to information systems that are under our control, they cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe and our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time, or unauthorized releases of proprietary or confidential information, could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business.
our financial results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities as a global company, our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions, and significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities. our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates, in the valuation of deferred tax assets, in tax laws, by material audit assessments, or changes in or expirations of agreements with tax authorities. these factors could affect our profitability. in particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the united states, is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states. in addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability.
a failure to comply with environmental regulations may adversely affect our operating results we are subject to a variety of domestic and international governmental regulations related to the handling, discharge, and disposal of toxic, volatile, or otherwise hazardous chemicals. failure to comply with present or future environmental regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, require us to suspend production, or cease operations, or cause our customers to not accept our products. these regulations could require us to alter our current operations, acquire significant additional equipment, incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations, or take other actions. any failure to comply with regulations governing the use, handling, sale, transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities that may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and ability to operate our business.
if we choose to acquire or dispose of businesses, product lines and technologies, we may encounter unforeseen costs and difficulties that could impair our financial performance an important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products, augment our market coverage and distribution ability, or enhance our technological capabilities. as a result, we may make acquisitions of complementary companies, products or technologies, or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies that no longer fit our long-term strategies. managing an acquired business, disposing of product technologies or reducing personnel entail numerous operational and financial risks, including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups, diversion of management's attention away from other business concerns, amortization of acquired intangible assets, adverse customer reaction to our decision to cease support for a product, and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations. there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions, disposition of
22
product lines or technologies, or reduction in personnel or that our management, personnel, or systems will be adequate to support continued operations. any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows.
in addition, any acquisition could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, the amortization of related intangible assets, and goodwill impairment charges, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and/or the price of our common stock.
the market for our common stock is volatile, which may affect our ability to raise capital, make acquisitions, or subject our business to additional costs the market price for our common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years. the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors, many of which are not within our control or influence. these factors include but are not limited to the following:
   general market, semiconductor, or semiconductor equipment industry conditions;
   economic or political events and trends occurring globally or in any of our key sales regions;
   variations in our quarterly operating results and financial condition, including our liquidity;
   variations in our revenues, earnings or other business and financial metrics from forecasts by us or securities analysts, or from those experienced by other companies in our industry;
   announcements of restructurings, reductions in force, departure of key employees, and/or consolidations of operations;
   government regulations;
   developments in, or claims relating to, patent or other proprietary rights;
   technological innovations and the introduction of new products by us or our competitors;
   commercial success or failure of our new and existing products;
   disruptions of relationships with key customers or suppliers; or
   convertibility and dilutive impacts of our convertible notes and related warrants.
in addition, the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations. historically, we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our common stock due in part to the price of and markets for semiconductors. these and other factors have and may again adversely affect the price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. in the past, following volatile periods in the price of their stock, many companies became the object of securities class action litigation. if we are sued in a securities class action, we could incur substantial costs, and it could divert management's attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on our financial performance and the price for our common stock.
intellectual property, indemnity, and other claims against us can be costly and we could lose significant rights that are necessary to our continued business and profitability third parties may assert infringement, unfair competition, product liability, breach of contract, or other claims against us. from time to time, other persons send us notices alleging that our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights. in addition, law enforcement authorities may seek criminal charges relating to intellectual property or other issues. we also face risks of claims arising from commercial and other relationships. in addition, our bylaws and other indemnity obligations provide that we will indemnify officers and directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to us. from time to time, in the normal course of business, we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships, including customers and suppliers, with respect to certain matters. we have agreed, under certain conditions, to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses, such as those arising from a breach of representations or
23
covenants, other third party claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such other third parties, or other claims made against certain parties. in such cases, it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms. however, we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially adversely affect our business and financial results, and we may be subject to substantial damage awards and penalties. moreover, although we have insurance to protect us from certain claims and cover certain losses to our property, such insurance may not cover us for the full amount of any losses, or at all, and may be subject to substantial exclusions and deductibles.
we may fail to protect our critical proprietary technology rights, which could affect our business our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and our ability to protect key components of that technology through patents, copyrights and trade secret protection. protecting our key proprietary technology helps us to achieve our goals of developing technological expertise and new products and systems that give us a competitive advantage; increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base; and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers. as part of our strategy to protect our technology we currently hold a number of u.s. and foreign patents and pending patent applications, and we keep certain information, processes and techniques as trade secrets. however, other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the united states or foreign governments issue to us, these governments may fail to issue patents for pending applications, or we may lose trade secret protection over valuable information due to the intentional or unintentional actions or omissions of third parties, of ours or even our own employees. additionally, intellectual property litigation can be expensive and time-consuming and even when patents are issued or trade secret processes are followed, the legal systems in certain of the countries in which we do business do not enforce patents and other intellectual property rights as rigorously as the united states. the rights granted or anticipated under any of our patents, pending patent applications or trade secrets may be narrower than we expect or, in fact, provide no competitive advantages. moreover, because we determine the jurisdictions in which to file patents at the time of filing, we may not have adequate protection in the future based on such previous decisions. any of these circumstances could have a material adverse impact on our business.
we are exposed to various risks from our regulatory environment we are subject to various risks related to (i) new, different, inconsistent or even conflicting laws, rules and regulations that may be enacted by legislative bodies and/or regulatory agencies in the countries that we operate; (ii) disagreements or disputes between national or regional regulatory agencies related to international trade; and (iii) the interpretation and application of laws, rules and regulations. as a public company with global operations, we are subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, including those related to financial and other disclosures, corporate governance, privacy, anti-corruption, such as the foreign corrupt practices act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, conflict minerals or other social responsibility legislation, and antitrust regulations, among others. each of these laws, rules and regulations imposes costs on our business, including financial costs and potential diversion of our management's attention associated with compliance, and may present risks to our business, including potential fines, restrictions on our actions, and reputational damage if we are unable to fully comply.
to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with all evolving standards. changes in or ambiguous interpretations of laws, regulations and standards may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters. efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management's time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities. if we are found by a court or regulatory agency not to be in compliance with the laws and regulations, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase our shares at all or in any particular amounts.
our board of directors has declared quarterly dividends since april 2014. our intent to continue to pay quarterly dividends and to repurchase our shares is subject to capital availability and, in the case of dividends, periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends by us. future dividends and share repurchases may also be affected by, among other factors: our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our research and development; legal risks; stock repurchase programs; changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws; contractual restrictions, such as financial or operating covenants in our debt arrangements; and changes to our business model. our dividend payments and share repurchases may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or repurchase shares at all or in any particular amounts. a reduction or suspension in our dividend payments or share repurchase activity could have a negative effect on our stock price.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect. our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in "risk factors" and elsewhere in this 2015 form 10-k and other documents we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission. (see "cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements" in part i of this 2015 form 10-k).
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") provides a description of our results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in this 2015 form 10-k. md&a consists of the following sections:
executive summary provides a summary of the key highlights of our results of operations and our management's assessment of material trends and uncertainties relevant to our business.
results of operations provides an analysis of operating results.
critical accounting policies and estimates discusses accounting policies that reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

executive summary lam research has been an innovative supplier of wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry for more than 35 years. our customers include semiconductor manufacturers that make memory, microprocessors, and other logic integrated circuits for a wide range of electronics; including cell phones, computers, tablets, storage devices, and networking equipment.
our market-leading products are designed to help our customers build the smaller, faster, and more powerful devices that are necessary to power the capabilities required by end users. the process of integrated circuits fabrication consists of a complex series of process and preparation steps, and our product offerings in deposition, etch, and clean address a number of the most critical steps in the fabrication process. we leverage our expertise in semiconductor processing to develop technology and/or productivity solutions that typically benefit our customers through lower defect rates, enhanced yields, faster processing time, and reduced cost as well as by facilitating their ability to meet more stringent performance and design standards.
the semiconductor capital equipment industry has been highly competitive and characterized by rapid changes in demand. this cyclicality has been mitigated in recent years by market demands and consolidation among our customers. with a reduced number of customers, variability in their business plans may lead to changes in demand for lam's equipment and services. the variability in our customers' investments during any particular period is dependent on several factors including but not limited to electronics demand, economic conditions (both general and in the semiconductor and electronics industries), industry supply and demand, prices for semiconductors, and our customers' ability to develop and manufacture increasingly complex and costly semiconductor devices.
demand for our products was strong throughout the fiscal year as semiconductor device manufacturers made capacity and technology investments. we expect growth in the overall wafer fabrication equipment market in calendar year 2015 compared to calendar year 2014 related to leading edge investments by our customers. technology inflections in our industry, including finfet transistors, 3d nand, multiple patterning, and advanced packaging have led to an increase in the deposition and etch market sizes. we believe that, over the longer term, demand for our products should increase as the proportion of customers' capital expenditures rises in these technology inflection areas, and we continue to gain market share.

fiscal year 2015 revenues increased 14% compared to fiscal year 2014, reflecting the steady increase in technology inflections' spending, as well as incremental market share gains. the small decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was due primarily to less favorable product mix partially offset by improved factory utilization due to higher production volumes.
operating expenses in fiscal year 2015 increased as compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily related to continued investments in the next-generation research and development. in fiscal year 2015, we also recorded a goodwill impairment of approximately $79 million related to our single-wafer clean reporting unit.
our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and investments balances totaled approximately $4.2 billion as of june 28, 2015 compared to $3.2 billion as of june 29, 2014. this increase was primarily the result of $992 million net proceeds from march 2015 senior notes issuance. cash flows provided from operating activities was $786 million for fiscal year 2015 compared to $717 million for fiscal year 2014. cash flows provided from operating activities in fiscal 2015 was primarily used for $573 million in treasury stock purchases, $116 million in dividends paid to our stockholders, and $198 million of capital expenditures, and are partially offset by $66 million of treasury stock reissuance and common stock issuance resulting from our employee equity-based compensation programs.
results of operations shipments and backlog shipments for fiscal year 2015 were approximately $5.5 billion and increased by 20% compared to fiscal year 2014. shipments for fiscal year 2014 were approximately $4.6 billion and increased by 23% compared to fiscal year 2013. the increase in shipments during fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014, as well as the
32
increase in shipments during fiscal year 2014 as compared to fiscal year 2013 related to continued strengthening of customer demand for semiconductor equipment.

the decrease in sg&a expense during fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was due primarily to an $11 million decrease in integration costs, a $9 million decrease in costs associated with rationalization of product configurations, and an $8 million decrease related to impairment of long lived assets. this decrease is offset by an $8 million increase in compensation and benefits expense.
the increase in sg&a expense during fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was due primarily to a net increase of $11 million in salaries, benefits and incentive compensation, $20 million increase in marketing expenses and outside services, $7 million in costs associated with rationalization of certain product configurations, $8 million of impairment of long lived assets, and a $5 million cost related to the renewal of our fremont and livermore buildings' operating leases. this increase was offset by a $34 million reduction in integration costs and a $10 million reduction in amortization of intangible assets related to the novellus integration.
goodwill impairment our annual goodwill impairment analysis for fiscal year 2015 resulted in a non-cash impairment charge upon our single-wafer clean reporting unit of $79 million, extinguishing the goodwill ascribed to the reporting unit. uncertainty surrounding future revenue growth in certain products resulted in the estimated discounted cash flow falling below the carrying value of the goodwill balance.

the increase in interest expense during fiscal year 2015 as compared with fiscal years 2014 and 2013 was primarily due to the $1 billion senior note issuance in the march 2015 quarter.
foreign exchange gains in fiscal year 2015 and 2014 and losses in fiscal years 2013 were related to un-hedged portions of the balance sheet exposures.

income tax expense (benefit)   $85,273                  $91,074                  $(47,221        )

the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to geographic mix of income between higher and lower tax jurisdictions, and an increased federal tax benefit in fiscal year 2015 due to a retroactive reinstatement of the second half of fiscal year 2014 federal research and development tax credit in fiscal year 2015. the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2014 as compared to fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to the change in the level of income and geographic mix of income between higher and lower tax jurisdictions, u.s. income and applicable foreign withholding taxes on undistributed foreign earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries for 2014, reduced tax benefit in fiscal year 2014 due to the expiration of the federal research and development tax credit as of december 31, 2013, and tax benefits in fiscal year 2013 related to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to the lapse of the statute of limitations and successful resolution of certain tax matters.
international revenues account for a significant portion of our total revenues, such that a material portion of our pre-tax income is earned and taxed outside the united states at rates that are generally lower than in the united states. please refer to note 7 of our consolidated financial statements.
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. our gross deferred tax assets, composed primarily of reserves and accruals that are not currently deductible and tax credit carryforwards, were $311 million and $343 million at the end of fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively. these gross deferred tax assets were offset by deferred tax liabilities of $318 million and $294 million at the end of fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively, and a valuation allowance of $86 million and $74 million at the end of fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively. the change in the gross deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities between fiscal year 2015 and 2014 is primarily due to the reclassification of deferred tax assets as a result of the adoption of accounting standards update 2013-11, an accrual for future tax liabilities due to the expected repatriation of foreign earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries for 2015, and convertible debt accretion, offset by a decrease in deferred tax liabilities related to amortization of intangible assets.
our fiscal years 2015 and 2014 valuation allowance of $86 million and $74 million primarily relate to california and certain foreign deferred tax assets.
as of our fiscal year end of june 28, 2015, we continue to record a valuation allowance to offset the entire california deferred tax asset balance due to the single sales factor apportionment election resulting in lower taxable income in california. we also continue to record valuation allowances on certain foreign entities' net operating losses.
we evaluate if the deferred tax assets are realizable on a quarterly basis and will continue to assess the need for changes in valuation allowances, if any.
36
uncertain tax positions we re-evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. this evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, and effectively settled issues under audit. such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") requires management to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. we based our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believed to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions. actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.
the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in note 2 of our consolidated financial statements. some of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies. a critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, complex, and/or subjective judgments, often regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.
we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition: we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, collection of the receivable is reasonably assured, and we have received customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations. if terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period, we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance, whichever occurs first. if the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision, we recognize revenue when it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreed-to customer specifications. in situations with multiple deliverables, we recognize revenue upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations. we allocate revenue from multiple-element arrangements among the separate elements using their relative selling prices, based on our best estimate of selling price. our sales arrangements do not include a general right of return. the maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items. we generally recognize revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits upon shipment. we generally recognize revenue related to services upon completion of the services requested by a customer order. we recognize revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. when goods or services have been delivered to the customer, but all conditions for revenue recognition have not been met, deferred revenue and deferred costs are recorded in deferred profit on our consolidated balance sheet.
inventory valuation: inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard costs that approximate actual costs on a first-in, first-out basis. finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer. unless specified in the terms of sale, title generally transfers at the physical transfer of the products to the freight carriers. transfer of title for shipments to japanese customers occurs at the time of customer acceptance.
management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly. our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods, and spare parts in each reporting period. obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management's estimated
37
usage requirement is written down to its estimated market value if less than cost. estimates of market value include, but are not limited to, management's forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and/or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, and possible alternative uses. if future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period in which we make the revision.
warranty: typically, the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and service warranties to customers as part of the overall price of the system. we provide standard warranties for our systems. we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system when we recognize revenue. we do not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific systems. all actual or estimated parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves on a system-by-system basis.
while we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. in addition to the provision of standard warranties, we offer customer-paid extended warranty services. revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. related costs are recorded as incurred.
equity-based compensation  employee stock purchase plan ("espp") and employee stock plans: we recognize the fair value of equity-based compensation expense. we determine the fair value of our restricted stock units ("rsus"), excluding market-based performance rsus, based upon the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant, discounted for dividends. we estimate the fair value of our market-based performance rsus using a monte carlo simulation model at the date of the grant. we estimate the fair value of our stock options and espp awards using a black-scholes option valuation model. this model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award. we amortize the fair value of equity-based awards over the vesting periods of the award and we have elected to use the straight-line method of amortization.
we make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our tax credit pool related to equity-based compensation to determine if there are any deficiencies that we are required to recognize in our consolidated statements of operations. we will only recognize a benefit from equity-based compensation in paid-in-capital if we realize an incremental tax benefit after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized. in addition, we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of equity-based compensation on the research tax credit through the income statement rather than through paid-in-capital. we have also elected to net deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for the accumulated stock award tax benefits for income tax footnote disclosure purposes. we will track these stock award attributes separately and will only recognize these attributes through paid-in-capital.
income taxes: deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more-likely-than-not to be realized. realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. we believe it is more-likely-than-not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at the time. in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. likewise, if we later determine that it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed.
we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.
38
goodwill and intangible assets: the valuation of intangible assets acquired in a business combination requires the use of management estimates including but not limited to estimating future expected cash flows from assets acquired and determining discount rates. management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available.
goodwill represents the amount by which the purchase price in each business combination exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. each component of the company for which discrete financial information is available and for which management regularly reviews the results of operations is considered a reporting unit. all goodwill acquired in a business combination is assigned to one or more reporting units as of the acquisition date. goodwill is assigned to our reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. the goodwill assigned to a reporting unit is the difference between the acquisition consideration assigned to the reporting unit on a relative fair value basis and the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities that can be specifically attributed to the reporting unit. we test goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually. we amortize intangible assets with estimable useful lives over their respective estimated useful lives, and we review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.
we review goodwill at least annually for impairment. if certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests, we will perform an impairment test at that date. in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, we: (1) allocate goodwill to the reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates; (2) estimate the fair value of our reporting units; and (3) determine the carrying value (book value) of those reporting units. prior to this allocation of the assets to the reporting units, we assess long-lived assets for impairment. furthermore, if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we must estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of that reporting unit, in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business. this can require independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as in-process r&d and developed technology. only after this process is completed can the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, be determined. in our goodwill impairment process we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative analysis. we do not calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis, which was performed as of the first day of our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, march 30, 2015, resulted in the recognition of a $79.4 million goodwill impairment charge on our single-wafer clean systems reporting unit. we did not record any goodwill impairment in fiscal years 2014 or 2013.
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis. we determine the fair value of our reporting units by using an income approach. under the income approach, we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn.
in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit, we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of our reporting units, including estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment. although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates it is using to manage the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit. in addition, we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units. changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge.
as a result, several factors could result in an impairment of a material amount of our goodwill balance in future periods, including, but not limited to: (1) weakening of the global economy, weakness in the semiconductor
39
equipment industry, or our failure to reach internal forecasts, which could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted levels of cash flows and reduce the estimated discounted cash flow value of our reporting units; and (2) a decline in our common stock price and resulting market capitalization, and to the extent we determine that the decline is sustained and indicates a reduction in the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. further, the value assigned to intangible assets, other than goodwill, is based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations such as the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates, we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value.
recent accounting pronouncements in july 2013, the fasb released accounting standards update 2013-11 "presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists." the new standard requires that an unrecognized tax benefit should be presented as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward or other tax credit carryforward when settlement in this manner is available under the tax law. we adopted this standard during the fiscal year without significant impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
in april 2014, the fasb released accounting standards update 2014-8 "presentation of financial statements and property, plant and equipment: reporting discontinued operations and disclosure of disposals of components of an entity." the new standard re-defines discontinued operations and requires only those disposals of components of an entity, including classifications as held for sale, that represent a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results to be reported as discontinued operations. in addition, the new standard expands the disclosure requirements of discontinued operations. we adopted this standard during the fiscal year without significant impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
in may 2014, the fasb released accounting standards update 2014-9 "revenue from contracts with customers" to supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under gaap. the core principle of the standard is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. the new standard defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than required under existing gaap including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. we are required to adopt this standard starting in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 using either of two methods: (i) retrospective to each prior reporting period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients as defined within the standard; or (ii) retrospective with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures as defined per the standard. we have not yet selected a transition method, and are in the process of determining the impact that the new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.
in april 2015, the fasb released accounting standards update 2015-3 "interest  imputation of interest." the amendment requires that debt issuance costs related to recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. we are required to adopt this standard starting in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, we do not anticipate that adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
liquidity and capital resources total gross cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and investments balances were $4.2 billion at the end of fiscal year 2015 compared to $3.2 billion at the end of fiscal year 2014. this increase was primarily the result of $992 million net proceeds from the march 2015 debt issuances. approximately $2.2 billion of
40
our total cash and investments as of both june 28, 2015 and june 29, 2014, was held outside the united states in our foreign subsidiaries, the majority of which is held in u.s. dollars and, of which substantially all would be subject to tax at u.s. rates if it were to be repatriated. refer to note 7 of our consolidated financial statements, included in item 8 of this report, for information concerning the potential tax impact of repatriating earnings for certain non-u.s. subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested outside the united states.
cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities of $785.5 million during fiscal year 2015 consisted of (in millions):
net income                                                $655.6
non-cash charges:
depreciation and amortization                              277.9

$785.5
significant changes in operating asset and liability accounts, net of foreign exchange impact, included the following uses of cash: increases in accounts receivable of $294.2 million, inventories of $207.5 million, and prepaid expenses and other assets of $52.5 million, combined with a decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $29.5 million, partially offset by the following sources of cash: increases in accounts payable of $76.6 million and deferred profit of $86.1 million.
cash flows from investing activities net cash used for investing activities during fiscal year 2015 was $1,106.1 million, which was primarily due to net purchases of available-for-sale securities of $949.7 million, and capital expenditures of $198.3 million, partially offset by cash proceeds on the sale of business of $41.2 million.
cash flows from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year 2015 was $378.5 million, which was primarily due to $992.2 million in proceeds from issuance of long-term debt, partially offset by $573.2 million in treasury stock repurchases and $116.1 million of dividends paid to stockholders.
liquidity given the historical cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry, we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in r&d and capital infrastructure. based upon our current business outlook, we expect that our levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at june 28, 2015 will be sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations, investments, debt service requirements, and capital expenditures, through at least the next 12 months.
in the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products and services. while we have substantial cash balances in
41
the united states and offshore, we may require additional funding and need or choose to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. we believe that, if necessary, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. however, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us.
off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we have certain obligations to make future payments under various contracts, some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some of which are not. obligations that are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with gaap include our long-term debt which is outlined in the following table. our off-balance sheet arrangements are presented as operating leases and purchase obligations in the table. our contractual obligations and commitments as of june 28, 2015, relating to these agreements and our guarantees are included in the following table based on their contractual maturity date. the amounts in the table below exclude $203 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax benefits as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or time of settlement. see note 7 of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

long-term debt in may 2011, we issued and sold $450 million in aggregate principal amount of 0.50% convertible senior notes due may 2016 (the "2016 notes") at par. at the same time, we issued and sold $450 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.25% convertible senior notes due may 2018 (the "2018 notes") at par. we pay cash interest at an annual rate of 0.5% and 1.25%, respectively, on the 2016 notes and the 2018 notes, on a semi-annual basis. the 2016 notes and 2018 notes may be converted into our common stock, under certain circumstances, based on a conversion rate of 16.0806 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which is equal to a conversion price of approximately $62.19 per share of our common stock. the conversion price will be subject to adjustment for certain corporate events, including dividends on our common stock. concurrently with the issuance of the notes, we purchased convertible note hedges and sold warrants, which were structured to reduce the potential future economic dilution associated with the conversion of the 2016 notes and 2018 the notes.
in june 2012, with the acquisition of novellus, we assumed $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.625% convertible senior notes due may 2041 (the "2041 notes," and collectively with the 2016 notes and the 2018 notes, the "convertible notes"). we pay cash interest at an annual rate of 2.625%, on a semi-annual basis. the 2041 notes may be converted, under certain circumstances, into our common stock based on a conversion rate of 28.8585 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which represents a conversion price of approximately $34.65 per share of common stock. the conversion price will be subject to adjustment for certain events, including dividends on our common stock.
during the quarter-ended june 28, 2015, the market value of our common stock was greater than or equal to 130% of the convertible notes conversion prices for 20 or more trading days of the 30 consecutive trading days preceding the quarter end. as a result, the convertible notes are convertible at the option of the holder and are classified as current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets for fiscal year 2015.
on march 12, 2015, we completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due march 15, 2020 (the "2020 notes") and $500 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due march 15, 2025 (the "2025 notes," together with the 2020 notes, the "senior notes", and collectively with the convertible notes, the "notes"). we will pay interest at an annual rate of 2.75% and 3.80%, respectively, on the 2020 notes and 2025 notes, on a semi-annual basis on march 15 and september 15 of each year, beginning september 15, 2015.
we may redeem the senior notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such series ("par"), plus a "make whole" premium as described in the indenture in respect to the senior notes and accrued and unpaid interest before february 15, 2020, for the 2020 notes and before december 15, 2024, for the 2025 notes. we may redeem the senior notes at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest at any time on or after february 15, 2020 for the 2020 notes and on or after december 24, 2024 for the 2025 notes. in addition, upon the occurrence of certain events, as described in the indenture, we will be required to make an offer to repurchase the senior notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the senior notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
during fiscal year 2015, 2014, and 2013, we made $1.5 million, $1.7 million, and $2.2 million, respectively, in principal payments on long-term debt and capital leases, respectively.
revolving credit arrangements on march 12, 2014, we entered into a $300 million revolving unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of lenders that matures on march 12, 2019. the facility includes an option for us to, subject to certain requirements, request an increase in the facility of up to an additional $200 million, for a potential total commitment of $500 million.

proceeds from the credit facility can be used for general corporate purposes. interest on amounts borrowed under the credit facility is, at our option, based on (i) a base rate, defined as the greatest of (a) prime rate, (b) federal funds rate plus 0.5%, or (c) one-month libor plus 1.0%, plus a spread of 0.0% to 0.5% or (ii) libor plus a spread of 0.9% to 1.5%, in each case the applicable spread is determined based on the rating of our non-credit enhanced, senior unsecured long-term debt. principal, and any accrued and unpaid interest, is due and payable upon maturity. additionally, we will pay the lenders a quarterly commitment fee that varies based on our rating described above. the credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants including maintaining a consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio of no more than 0.5 to 1.0 and maintaining unrestricted or unencumbered cash and investments, of no less than $1.0 billion. as of june 28, 2015, we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and were in compliance with all financial covenants.
other guarantees we have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors for taxes and general liability under some of our agreements. we have entered into certain insurance contracts that may limit our exposure to such indemnifications. as of june 28, 2015, we had not recorded any liability on our consolidated financial statements in connection with these indemnifications, as we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that we will pay any amounts under these guarantees.
generally, we indemnify, under pre-determined conditions and limitations, our customers for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by our products or services. we seek to limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products or services subject to our indemnification obligations. we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that we will pay any material amounts under these guarantees.
we provide guarantees and standby letters of credit to certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated during the ordinary course of business. as of june 28, 2015, the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these arrangements and letters of credit was $15.5 million. we do not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid.

item 1a. risk factors we are providing the following cautionary statements which identify all known material risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical and expected results.
we operate in the capital, commodities and commercial markets. the capital markets include asset managers, investment banks, commercial banks, insurance companies, exchanges, and issuers; the commodities markets include producers, traders and intermediaries within energy, metals, petrochemicals and agriculture; and the commercial markets include professionals and corporate executives within automotive, financial services, insurance and marketing / research information services. certain risk factors are applicable to certain of our individual segments while other risk factors are applicable company-wide.
exposure to litigation and government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
•   in the normal course of business, both in the united states and abroad, we and our subsidiaries are defendants in numerous legal proceedings and are often the subject of government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries, as discussed under item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, in this annual report on form 10-k and in note 12 - commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements under item 8, consolidated financial statements and supplementary data, in this annual report on form 10-k, and we face the risk that additional proceedings, investigations and inquiries will arise in the future.
•   many of these proceedings, investigations and inquiries relate to the ratings activity of s&amp;p ratings brought by issuers and alleged purchasers of rated securities. in addition, various government and self-regulatory agencies frequently make inquiries and conduct investigations into our compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including those related to ratings activities and antitrust matters.
•   any of these proceedings, investigations or inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments, damages, fines, penalties or activity restrictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
•   in view of the uncertainty inherent in litigation and government and regulatory enforcement matters, we cannot predict the eventual outcome of the matters we are currently facing or the timing of their resolution, or in most cases reasonably estimate what the eventual judgments, damages, fines, penalties or impact of activity restrictions may be. as a result, we cannot provide assurance that the outcome of the matters we are currently facing or that we may face in the future will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
•   as litigation or the process to resolve pending matters progresses, as the case may be, we continuously review the latest information available and assess our ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business and competitive position, which may require that we record liabilities in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.
10
•   legal proceedings impose additional expenses on the company and require the attention of senior management to an extent that may significantly reduce their ability to devote time addressing other business issues.
•   risks relating to legal proceedings may be heightened in foreign jurisdictions that lack the legal protections or liability standards comparable to those that exist in the united states. in addition, new laws and regulations have been and may continue to be enacted that establish lower liability standards, shift the burden of proof or relax pleading requirements, thereby increasing the risk of successful litigations against the company in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions. these litigation risks are often difficult to assess or quantify and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
•   we may not have adequate insurance or reserves to cover these risks, and the existence and magnitude of these risks often remains unknown for substantial periods of time and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
our acquisitions and other strategic transactions may not produce anticipated results.
•   we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions or enter into other strategic transactions to strengthen our business and grow our company.
•   such transactions, including our recent acquisition of snl financial lc, present significant challenges and risks.
•   the market for acquisition targets and other strategic transactions is highly competitive, especially in light of industry consolidation, which may affect our ability to complete such transactions.
•   if we are unsuccessful in completing such transactions or if such opportunities for expansion do not arise, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
•   if such transactions are completed, the anticipated growth and other strategic objectives of such transactions may not be fully realized, and a variety of factors may adversely affect any anticipated benefits from such transactions. for instance, the process of integration may require more resources than anticipated, we may assume unintended liabilities, there may be unexpected regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures, we may fail to retain key personnel of the acquired business and such transactions may divert management's focus from other business operations.
•   the anticipated benefits from an acquisition or other strategic transaction may not be realized fully, or may take longer to realize than expected. for instance, although we have identified approximately $100 million in synergies expected to be realized by 2019 largely from operational efficiencies and our ability to accelerate snl financial's international growth through its global footprint, there is no guarantee that we will be able to achieve any or all of these synergies. as a result, the failure of acquisitions and other strategic transactions to perform as expected could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
changes in the volume of securities issued and traded in domestic and/or global capital markets and changes in interest rates and volatility in the financial markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
•   our business is impacted by general economic conditions and volatility in the united states and world financial markets. therefore, since a significant component of our credit-rating based revenue is transaction-based, and is essentially dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets, unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers' willingness or ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuances for which s&amp;p ratings provides credit ratings.
•   increases in interest rates or credit spreads, volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment, significant political or economic events, defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance, the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers, the level of derivatives trading and/or the types of credit-sensitive products being offered, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
•   any weakness in the macroeconomic environment could constrain customer budgets across the markets we serve, potentially leading to a reduction in their employee headcount and a decrease in demand for our subscription-based
11
products.
increasing regulation of our s&p ratings business in the united states, europe and elsewhere can increase our costs of doing business and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
•   the financial services industry is highly regulated, rapidly evolving and subject to the potential for increasing regulation in the united states, europe and elsewhere. the businesses conducted by s&amp;p ratings are in certain cases regulated under the credit rating agency reform act of 2006 (the "reform act"), the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act (the "dodd-frank act"), the u.s. securities exchange act of 1934 (the "exchange act"), and/or the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which they conduct business.
•   in the past several years, the u.s. congress, the international organization of securities commissions ("iosco"), the sec and the european commission, including through the european securities market authority ("esma"), as well as regulators in other countries in which s&amp;p ratings operates, have been reviewing the role of rating agencies and their processes and the need for greater oversight or regulations concerning the issuance of credit ratings or the activities of credit rating agencies. other laws, regulations and rules relating to credit rating agencies are being considered by local, national and multinational bodies and are likely to continue to be considered in the future, including provisions seeking to reduce regulatory and investor reliance on credit ratings, rotation of credit rating agencies and liability standards applicable to credit rating agencies.
•   these laws and regulations, and any future rulemaking, could result in reduced demand for credit ratings and increased costs, which we may be unable to pass through to customers. in addition, there may be uncertainty over the scope, interpretation and administration of such laws and regulations. we may be required to incur significant expenses in order to comply with such laws and regulations and to mitigate the risk of fines, penalties or other sanctions. legal proceedings could become increasingly lengthy and there may be uncertainty over and exposure to liability. it is difficult to accurately assess the future impact of legislative and regulatory requirements on our business and our customers' businesses, and they may affect s&amp;p ratings' communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process, alter the manner in which s&amp;p ratings' ratings are developed, affect the manner in which s&amp;p ratings or its customers or users of credit ratings operate, impact the demand for ratings and alter the economics of the credit ratings business. each of these developments increase the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and may have a material adverse effect on our operations, profitability and competitiveness, the demand for credit ratings and the manner in which such ratings are utilized.
•   additional information regarding rating agencies is provided under item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, in this annual report on form 10-k.
our s&p dj indices and c&c businesses are subject to the potential for increasing regulatory review in the united states, europe and elsewhere, which can increase our costs of doing business and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
•   in addition to the extensive and evolving u.s. laws and regulations, foreign jurisdictions, principally in europe, have taken measures to increase regulation of the financial services and commodities industries.
•   in october of 2012, iosco issued its principles for oil price reporting agencies ("pra principles"), which iosco states are intended to enhance the reliability of oil price assessments that are referenced in derivative contracts subject to regulation by iosco members. platts has taken steps to align its operations with the pra principles and, as recommended by iosco in its final report on the pra principles, has aligned to the pra principles for other commodities for which it publishes benchmarks.
•   in july of 2013, iosco issued its principles for financial benchmarks ("financial benchmark principles"), which are intended to promote the reliability of benchmark determinations, and address governance, benchmark quality and accountability mechanisms, including with regard to the indices published by s&amp;p dj indices. s&amp;p dj indices has taken steps to align its governance regime and operations with the financial benchmark principles and engaged an independent auditor to perform a reasonable assurance review of such alignment.
•   the financial benchmarks industry is subject to the new pending benchmark regulation in the european union (the "e.u. benchmark regulation") as well as potential increased regulation in other jurisdictions. the proposed e.u. benchmark regulation has been released for final approval and is expected to be published later this year. the e.u. benchmark
12
regulation will likely require s&p dj indices and platts in due course to obtain registration or authorization in connection with its benchmark activities in europe. this legislation will likely cause additional operating obligations but they are not expected to be material at this time and until the regulation is finalized the exact impact is not certain.
•   the european union has recently finalized a package of legislative measures known as mifid ii ("mifid ii"), which revise and update the existing e.u. markets in financial instruments directive framework. mifid ii will apply in full in all e.u. member states from january 3, 2017. mifid ii includes provisions that, among other things: (i) impose new conditions and requirements on the licensing of benchmarks and provide for non-discriminatory access to exchanges and clearing houses; (ii) modify the categorization and treatment of certain classes of derivatives; (iii) expand the categories of trading venue that are subject to regulation; and (iv) provide for the mandatory trading of certain derivatives on exchanges (complementing the mandatory derivative clearing requirements in the e.u. market infrastructure regulation of 2011). although the mifid ii package is "framework" legislation (meaning that much of the detail of the rules will be set out in subordinate measures to be agreed upon in the period before 2017), it is possible that the introduction of these laws and rules could affect s&amp;p dj indices' and platts' abilities both to administer and license their indices and price assessments, respectively.
changes to regulations in the united states, europe and elsewhere may impact our s&p capital iq and snl business by increasing the costs of doing business globally, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
•   s&amp;p capital iq and snl operates regulated investment advisory businesses in the united states, the european union and certain other countries. these and other s&amp;p capital iq and snl businesses may increasingly become subject to new or more stringent regulations that will increase the cost of doing business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
•   mifid ii and the market abuse regulation ("mar") may impose additional regulatory burdens on s&amp;p capital iq and snl's activities in the european union, although the exact severity and cost are not yet known.
we may become subject to liability based on the use of our products by our clients.
•   some of our products support the investment processes of our clients, which, in the aggregate, manage trillions of dollars of assets. use of our products as part of the investment process creates the risk that clients, or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients, may pursue claims against us for very significant dollar amounts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
•   any such claim, even if the outcome were to be ultimately favorable to us, would involve a significant commitment of our management, personnel, financial and other resources and could have a negative impact on our reputation. in addition, such claims and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
increased competition could result in a loss of market share or revenue.
•   the markets for credit ratings, financial research, investment and advisory services, index-based products, and commodities price assessments and related news and information about the commodities markets are intensely competitive. s&amp;p ratings, s&amp;p capital iq and snl, s&amp;p dj indices and c&amp;c compete domestically and internationally on the basis of a number of factors, including the quality of its ratings, research and advisory services, client service, reputation, price, geographic scope, range of products and technological innovation.
•   while our businesses face competition from traditional content and analytics providers, we also face competition from non-traditional providers such as exchanges, asset managers, investment banks and technology-led companies that are adding content and analytics capabilities to their core businesses.
•   in addition, in some of the countries in which s&amp;p ratings competes, governments may provide financial or other support to locally-based rating agencies and may from time to time establish official credit rating agencies, credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers.
•   sustained downward pressure on oil and other commodities prices and trading activity in those markets could have a material adverse effect on the rate of growth of platts' revenue, including subscription and licensing fees.
13
introduction of new products, services or technologies could impact our profitability.
•   we operate in highly competitive markets that continue to change to adapt to customer needs. in order to maintain a competitive position, we must continue to invest in new offerings and new ways to deliver our products and services. these investments may not be profitable or may be less profitable than what we have experienced historically.
•   we could experience threats to our existing businesses from the rise of new competitors due to the rapidly changing environment in which we operate.
•   we rely on our information technology environment and certain critical databases, systems and applications to support key product and service offerings. we believe we have appropriate policies, processes and internal controls to ensure the stability of our information technology, provide security from unauthorized access to our systems and maintain business continuity, but our business could be subject to significant disruption and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by unanticipated system failures, data corruption or unauthorized access to our systems.
a significant increase in operating costs and expenses could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.
•   our major expenditures include employee compensation and capital investments.
•   we offer competitive salary and benefit packages in order to attract and retain the quality employees required to grow and expand our businesses. compensation costs are influenced by general economic factors, including those affecting the cost of health insurance and postretirement benefits, and any trends specific to the employee skill sets we require.
•   we make significant investments in information technology data centers and other technology initiatives and we cannot provide assurances that such investments will result in increased revenues.
•   although we believe we are prudent in our investment strategies and execution of our implementation plans, there is no assurance as to the ultimate recoverability of these investments.
consolidation of customers as well as staffing levels across our customer base could impact our available markets and revenue growth.
•   our businesses have a customer base which is largely comprised of members from the financial services and commodities industries. the current challenging business environment and the consolidation of customers resulting from mergers and acquisitions in the financial services and commodities industries can result in reductions in the number of firms and workforce which can impact the size of our customer base.
•   customers within the financial services and commodities industries that strive to reduce their operating costs may seek to reduce their spending on our products and services. if a large number of smaller customers or a critical number of larger customers reduce their spending with us, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
•   alternatively, customers may use other strategies to reduce their overall spending on financial and commodity market products and services by consolidating their spending with fewer vendors, including by selecting other vendors with lower-cost offerings, or by self-sourcing their need for financial and commodity market products and services. if customers elect to consolidate their spending on financial and commodity market products and services with other vendors and not us, if we lose business to lower priced competitors, or if customers elect to self-source their product and service needs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
•   a material portion of our revenues in our s&amp;p dj indices business is concentrated in some of our largest customers, who have significant assets under management in index funds and exchange-traded funds. a loss of a substantial portion of revenue from our largest customers could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
14
if we lose key outside suppliers of data and products or if the data or products of these suppliers have errors or are delayed, we may not be able to provide our clients with the information and products they desire.
•   our ability to produce our products and develop new products is dependent upon the products of other suppliers, including certain data, software and service suppliers. some of our products are dependent upon (and of little value without) updates from our data suppliers and most of our information and data products are dependent upon (and of little value without) continuing access to historical and current data.
•   we utilize certain data provided by third-party data sources in a variety of ways, including large volumes of data from certain stock exchanges around the world.
•   if the data from our suppliers has errors, is delayed, has design defects, is unavailable on acceptable terms or is not available at all, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
•   some of our agreements with data suppliers allow them to cancel on short notice. termination of one or more of our significant data agreements or exclusion from, or restricted use of, or litigation in connection with, a data provider's information could decrease the available information for us to use (and offer our clients) and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
changes in the legislative, regulatory, and commercial environments in which we operate may materially and adversely impact our ability to collect, compile, use, and publish data and may impact our financial results.
•   certain types of information we collect, compile, use, and publish, including offerings in our c&amp;c business, are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate. in addition, there is increasing concern among certain privacy advocates and government regulators regarding marketing and privacy matters, particularly as they relate to individual privacy interests.
•   these concerns may result in new or amended laws and regulations. future laws and regulations with respect to the collection, compilation, use, and publication of information and consumer privacy could result in limitations on our operations, increased compliance or litigation expense, adverse publicity, or loss of revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. it is also possible that we could be prohibited from collecting or disseminating certain types of data, which could affect our ability to meet our customers' needs.
our ability to protect our intellectual property rights could impact our competitive position.
•   our products contain intellectual property delivered through a variety of digital and other media. our ability to achieve anticipated results depends in part on our ability to defend our intellectual property against infringement. our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by inadequate or changing legal and technological protections for intellectual property and proprietary rights in some jurisdictions and markets.
we are exposed to multiple risks associated with the global nature of our operations.
•   the geographic breadth of our activities subjects us to significant legal, economic, operational, market, compliance and reputational risks. these include, among others, risks relating to:
•   economic and political conditions in foreign countries,
•   inflation,
•   fluctuation in interest rates and currency exchange rates,
•   limitations that foreign governments may impose on the conversion of currency or the payment of dividends or other remittances to us from our non-u.s. subsidiaries,
•   differing accounting principles and standards,
•   unexpected increases in taxes or changes in u.s. or foreign tax laws,
•   the costs of repatriating cash held by entities outside the united states, including withholding or other taxes that
15
foreign governments may impose on the payment of dividends or other remittances to us from our non-u.s. subsidiaries,
•   potential costs and difficulties in complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations (including tax systems) administered by foreign government agencies, some of which may conflict with u.s. or other sources of law,
•   changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements,
•   the possibility of nationalization, expropriation, price controls and other restrictive governmental actions,
•   competition with local rating agencies that have greater familiarity, longer operating histories and/or support from local governments or other institutions,
•   civil unrest, terrorism, unstable governments and legal systems, and other factors.
adverse developments in any of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
•   additionally, we are subject to complex u.s., european and other local laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations abroad, including trade sanctions laws, anti-corruption laws such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and the u.k. bribery act 2010, anti-bribery laws, anti-money laundering laws, and other financial crimes laws. although we have implemented internal controls, policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs to deter prohibited practices, such measures may not be effective in preventing employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies and violating applicable laws and regulations. any determination that we have violated trade sanctions, anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
•   compliance with international and u.s. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. violations of such laws and regulations may result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, administrative remedies, restrictions on business conduct and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business, financial condition or results of operations.
our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability.
•   should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood, terrorist attack, pandemic, security breach, cyber attack, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made disaster, our ability to continue to operate will depend, in part, on the availability of our personnel, our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations. in such an event, we could experience operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations, such as key executive officers or personnel, that could have a material adverse effect on our business.
•   we regularly assess and take steps to improve our existing business continuity plans and key management succession. however, a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions, or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem, could materially interrupt our business operations and result in material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships or legal liability.
outsourcing certain aspects of our business could result in disruption and increased costs.
•   we have outsourced certain support functions to third-party service providers to leverage leading specialized capabilities and achieve cost efficiencies. if the service providers to which we have outsourced these functions to do not perform effectively, we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings and, depending on the function involved, we may experience business disruption, processing inefficiencies, or harm employee morale.
16
we rely heavily on network systems and the internet and any failures or disruptions may adversely affect our ability to serve our customers.
•   many of our products and services are delivered electronically, and our customers rely on our ability to process transactions rapidly and deliver substantial quantities of data on computer-based networks. our customers also depend on the continued capacity, reliability and security of our electronic delivery systems, our websites and the internet.
•   our ability to deliver our products and services electronically may be impaired due to infrastructure or network failures, malicious or defective software, human error, natural disasters, service outages at third-party internet providers or increased government regulation.
•   delays in our ability to deliver our products and services electronically may harm our reputation and result in the loss of customers. in addition, a number of our customers entrust us with storing and securing their data and information on our servers.
•   although we have disaster recovery plans that include backup facilities for our primary data centers, our systems are not always fully redundant, and our disaster planning may not always be sufficient or effective. as such, these disruptions may affect our ability to store, handle and secure such data and information.
our operations and infrastructure may malfunction or fail, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
•   our ability to conduct business may be materially and adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which we are located, including new york city, the location of our headquarters, and major cities worldwide in which we have offices.
•   this may include a disruption involving physical or technological infrastructure used by us or third parties with or through whom we conduct business, whether due to human error, natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, acts of terrorism, political unrest, war or otherwise. our efforts to secure and plan for potential disruptions of our major operating systems may not be successful.
•   we rely on third-party providers to provide certain essential services. while we believe that such providers are reliable, we have limited control over the performance of such providers. to the extent any of our third-party providers ceases to provide these services in an efficient, cost-effective manner or fail to adequately expand its services to meet our needs and the needs of our customers, we could experience lower revenues and higher costs.
•   we also do not have fully redundant systems for most of our smaller office locations and low-risk systems, and our disaster recovery plan does not include restoration of non-essential services. if a disruption occurs in one of our locations or systems and our personnel in those locations or those who rely on such systems are unable to utilize other systems or communicate with or travel to other locations, such persons' ability to service and interact with our clients and customers may suffer.
•   we cannot predict with certainty all of the adverse effects that could result from our failure, or the failure of a third party, to efficiently address and resolve these delays and interruptions. a disruption to our operations or infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
we are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity and protection of confidential information.
•   our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential, sensitive and other types of information in our computer systems and networks and those of our third party vendors.
•   the cyber risks we face range from cyber-attacks common to most industries, to more advanced threats that target us because of our prominence in the global marketplace, or due to our ratings of sovereign debt. breaches of our or our vendors' technology and systems, whether from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service attacks or other cyber-attacks, hacking, computer viruses or malware, employee error, malfeasance, physical breaches or other actions, may cause material interruptions or malfunctions in our or such vendors' web sites, applications or data processing, or may compromise the confidentiality and integrity of material information regarding us or our business or customers.
17
•   measures that we take to avoid or mitigate material incidents can be expensive, and may be insufficient, circumvented, or may become obsolete. any material incidents could cause us to experience reputational harm, loss of customers, regulatory actions, sanctions or other statutory penalties, litigation or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us.
•   any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management discussion and analysis ("md&a") provides a narrative of the results of operations and financial condition of mcgraw hill financial, inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the "company," "we," "us" or "our") for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the md&a should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2015, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. ("u.s. gaap").
the md&a includes the following sections:
•   overview
•   results of operations
•   liquidity and capital resources
•   reconciliation of non-gaap financial information
•   critical accounting estimates
•   recently issued or adopted accounting standards certain of the statements below are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. in addition, any projections of future results of operations and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. see forward-looking statements on page 4 of this report.
overview we are a leading benchmarks and ratings, analytics, data and research provider serving the global capital, commodities and commercial markets. the capital markets include asset managers, investment banks, commercial banks, insurance companies, exchanges, and issuers; the commodities markets include producers, traders and intermediaries within energy, metals, petrochemicals and agriculture; and the commercial markets include professionals and corporate executives within automotive, financial services, insurance and marketing / research information services.
our operations consist of four reportable segments: standard & poor's ratings services ("s&p ratings"), s&p capital iq and snl, s&p dow jones indices ("s&p dj indices") and commodities & commercial ("c&c").
•   s&amp;p ratings is an independent provider of credit ratings, research and analytics, offering investors and market participants information, ratings and benchmarks.
•   s&amp;p capital iq and snl is a global provider of multi-asset-class data, research and analytical capabilities, which integrate cross-asset analytics and desktop services.

•   c&amp;c consists of business-to-business companies specializing in commercial and commodities markets that deliver their customers access to high-value information, data, analytic services and pricing and quality benchmarks. as of august 1, 2013, we completed the sale of aviation week and the results have been included in c&amp;c's results through that date.
in the fourth quarter of 2015, we began exploring strategic alternatives for j.d. power, included in our c&c segment. we committed to and initiated an active program to sell j.d. power in its current state that we believe is probable in the next year. as a result, we have classified the assets and liabilities of j.d. power as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2015. the anticipated disposal does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on operations and financial results, therefore, it is not classified as a discontinued operation.
on november 3, 2014, we completed the sale of mcgraw hill construction, which has historically been part of our c&c segment, to symphony technology group for $320 million in cash. we recorded an after-tax gain on the sale of $160 million, which is included in discontinued operations, net in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31, 2014. we used the after-tax proceeds from the sale to make selective acquisitions, investments, share repurchases and for general corporate purposes.
on march 22, 2013, we completed the sale of mcgraw-hill education ("mhe") to investment funds affiliated with apollo global management, llc for a purchase price of $2.4 billion in cash. we recorded an after-tax gain on the sale of $589 million, which
26
is included in discontinued operations, net in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31, 2013. we used the after-tax proceeds from the sale to pay down short-term debt for the special dividend paid in 2012, to make selective acquisitions, investments, share repurchases and for general corporate purposes.
in 2015, we continued to focus on investments in targeted financial assets, divesting selected non-core assets, reducing in our real estate portfolio and increasing shareholder return.
investments in targeted financial assets / divest selected non-core assets during 2015, we continued to create a portfolio focused on scalable, industry leading, interrelated businesses in the capital and commodity markets.

◦   we acquired national automobile dealers association's used car guide, a leading provider of u.s. retail, trade-in and auction used-vehicle valuation products, services and information.
in 2015, we further reduced our real estate footprint by completing the consolidation of our corporate headquarters with our operations in new york city.
during 2014, we continued to execute our strategy of investing for growth in markets that have size and scale while exiting non-core assets.
•   commodities &amp; commercial - we acquired eclipse energy group as which complements our north american natural gas capabilities, which we obtained from our bentek energy llc acquisition in 2011;
•   s&amp;p ratings - we acquired brc investor services s.a., a colombia-based ratings firm providing risk classifications of banks, financial services providers, insurance companies, corporate bonds and structured issues that will expand our presence in the latin american credit markets.
in 2014, in addition to the divestiture of mcgraw hill construction discussed above, we streamlined our infrastructure by reducing our real estate footprint through selling our data facility, initiating the consolidation of our corporate headquarters with our operations in new york city, as well as disposing of our corporate aircraft.
during 2013, we acquired an incremental 11 million equity shares representing 15.07% of crisil's total outstanding equity shares for $214 million, concurrently increasing our ownership percentage in crisil to 67.84% from 52.77%.
in 2013, we also completed certain dispositions of our non-core assets that allow us to apply greater focus on our high-growth, high-margin benchmark businesses.
•   commodities &amp; commercial - we completed the sale of aviation week to penton, a privately held business information company;
•   s&amp;p capital iq and snl - we completed the sale of financial communications as well as the closure of several non-core businesses.
increased shareholder return during the three years ended december 31, 2015, we have returned $3.3 billion to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and our quarterly dividends: we completed share repurchases of $2.3 billion and distributed regular quarterly dividends totaling approximately $997 million. also, on january 27, 2016, the board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly common stock dividend from $0.33 per share to $0.36 per share.

2   2015 includes legal settlements, partially offset by a benefit related to insurance recoveries of $54 million. 2014 includes legal and regulatory settlements of $1.6 billion and 2013 include legal settlements of $77 million.
2015
revenue increased 5% driven by increases at s&p capital iq and snl, c&c and s&p dj indices, partially offset by a decrease at s&p ratings. revenue growth at s&p capital iq and snl was due to the acquisition of snl in september of 2015 and growth of the legacy s&p capital iq products driven by increases in average contract values for each product. the revenue increase at c&c was primarily driven by continued demand for platts' proprietary content as annualized contract values increased. increases at j.d power primarily due to an increase in auto consulting engagements in the u.s. and the acquisition of national automobile dealers association's used car guide ("ucg") in july of 2015 driving the data and analytics revenue growth at c&c. revenue growth at s&p dj indices was due to higher average levels of assets under management for etfs and mutual funds and higher volumes for exchange-traded derivatives. the revenue decrease at s&p ratings was driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by 2 percentage points which was offset by the favorable impact from acquisitions of 2 percentage points.
the increase in operating profit was primarily due to the impact of $1.6 billion in legal and regulatory settlements in 2014 compared to net legal settlement expenses of $54 million in 2015. in addition, 2015 includes costs related to identified operating efficiencies primarily related to restructuring of $56 million in 2015 compared to $86 million in 2014. 2015 also includes acquisition-related costs related to the acquisition of snl of $37 million and an $11 million gain on the sale of our interest in a legacy mcgraw hill construction investment. 2014 includes $4 million of professional fees largely related to corporate development activities. excluding these items, operating profit increased 13%. this increase was driven by revenue growth at s&p capital iq and snl, c&c, and s&p dj indices and cost containment efforts at s&p ratings during 2015.
2014
revenue increased 7% driven by increases at all of our segments. the increase at s&p ratings was primarily driven by growth in both corporate and financial services bond ratings revenue, increases in bank loan ratings and higher annual fees. revenue growth at s&p capital iq and snl was driven by increases in average contract values for each product driven by new customer relationships and increases in existing accounts. revenue growth at s&p dj indices was due to higher levels of assets under management for etfs and mutual funds and higher volumes for exchange-traded derivatives. the revenue increase at c&c was primarily driven by continued demand for platts' proprietary content as annualized contract values increased and increases at j.d. power driven by strong demand for auto consulting engagements in the u.s. and singapore. the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by less than 1 percentage point.
operating profit decreased 92% driven by the unfavorable impact of $1.6 billion of legal and regulatory settlement charges in 2014 compared to legal settlement charges of $77 million in 2013 and higher costs recorded in 2014 related to identified operating efficiencies primarily related to restructuring, partially offset by revenue growth at all of our segments. excluding the unfavorable impact of legal and regulatory settlement charges of 111 percentage points, higher costs recorded in 2014 related to identified operating efficiencies primarily related to restructuring of 3 percentage points, partially offset by the favorable impact of costs necessary to enable the separation of mhe and reduce our cost structure recorded in 2013 of 5 percentage points and a net loss related to the sale of a data center, an equity investment at crisil, aviation week and financial communications in 2013 of 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 17%.

outlook our vision is to be the leading provider of transparent and independent benchmarks and ratings, analytics, data and research in the global capital, commodities and corporate markets. our mission is to promote sustainable growth in these markets by providing customers with essential intelligence and superior service. we seek to accomplish our mission and vision within the framework of our core values of fairness, integrity and transparency. we intend to deliver our products and services through customer-centric distribution channels that enable mission-critical decisions in our core customer sets of investment management, investment banking, commercial banking, insurance, specialty financial institutions and corporates.
we are aligning our efforts against two key strategic priorities: creating growth and driving performance.
creating growth
•   we will strive to drive global growth by focusing on executing our strategic initiatives, strengthening core capabilities and collaborating across businesses.
driving performance
•   we will strive to deliver operational excellence, manage and mitigate risk and enhance leadership and accountability.
there can be no assurance that we will achieve success in implementing any one or more of these strategies as a variety of factors could unfavorably impact operating results, including prolonged difficulties in the global credit markets and a change in the regulatory environment affecting our businesses. see item 1a, risk factors, in this annual report on form 10-k.
further projections and discussion on our 2016 outlook for our segments can be found within " - results of operations".

2015
revenue increased 5% as compared to 2014. subscription / non-transaction revenue increased primarily due to growth at s&p capital iq and snl due to an increase in the average contract values as well as continued demand for platts' proprietary content. non-subscription / transaction revenue increased primarily due to growth at s&p dj indices due to higher assets under management for etfs and mutual funds and higher volumes for exchange-traded derivatives, partially offset by a decrease at s&p ratings which includes the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. see " - segment review" below for further information.
the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by 2 percentage points. this impact refers to constant currency comparisons estimated by recalculating current year results of foreign operations using the average exchange rate from the prior year. the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue primarily related to s&p ratings and was driven by the weakening of the euro to the u.s. dollar.
2014
revenue increased 7% as compared to 2013. subscription / non-transaction revenue increased primarily due to growth at s&p capital iq and snl due to an increase in the average contract values, growth in non-issuance related revenue for corporate ratings primarily related to higher annual fees, and continued demand for platts' proprietary content. non-subscription / transaction revenue increased primarily due to strong growth in corporate bond ratings revenue, an increase in bank loan ratings and higher assets under management for etfs and mutual funds at s&p dj indices, partially offset by lower structured finance revenues. see " - segment review" below for further information.
the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by less than 1 percentage point.

operating profit we consider operating profit to be an important measure for evaluating our operating performance and we evaluate operating profit for each of the reportable business segments in which we operate.
we internally manage our operations by reference to "segment operating profit" with economic resources allocated primarily based on segment operating profit. segment operating profit is defined as operating profit before unallocated expense. segment operating profit is one of the key metrics we use to evaluate operating performance. segment operating profit is not, however, a measure of financial performance under u.s. gaap, and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner.
the table below reconciles segment operating profit to total operating profit:

2015
segment operating profit - increased $1.8 billion, or 629% as compared to 2014. 2015 includes legal settlement charges partially offset by a benefit related to insurance recoveries of $54 million compared to legal and regulatory settlement charges of $1.6 billion in 2014. excluding the favorable net impact of lower legal and regulatory settlement charges and insurance recoveries of 621 percentage points, higher costs recorded in 2014 related to identified operating efficiencies primarily related to restructuring of 9 percentage points and the impact of professional fees largely related to corporate development activities recorded in 2014 of 2 percentage points, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of acquisition-related costs related to the acquisition of snl of 15 percentage points, segment operating profit increased 11%. revenue growth at s&p capital iq and snl, c&c and s&p dj indices, and cost containment efforts at s&p ratings during 2015 were the primary drivers for the increase. see " - segment review" below for further information.
unallocated expense - decreased by $31 million or 18% as compared to 2014. these expenses, included in selling and general expenses, mainly include costs for corporate center functions, select initiatives, unoccupied office space and corporate overhead costs allocable to discontinued operations. excluding the favorable impact of the sale of our interest in a legacy mcgraw hill construction investment of 6 percentage points and higher costs recorded in 2014 related to identified operating efficiencies primarily related to restructuring of 4 percentage points, unallocated expense decreased by 9 percentage points as compared to 2014. this decrease was primarily driven by the impact of a $9 million loss recorded in the second quarter of 2014 related to the sale of the company's aircraft and the sale of our data center.
foreign currency exchange rates had a negligible impact on operating profit. the foreign exchange rate impact refers to constant currency comparisons and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities. constant currency impacts are estimated by recalculating current year results of foreign operations using the average exchange rate from the prior year. remeasurement impacts are based on the variance between current-year and prior-year foreign exchange rate fluctuations on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the individual business' functional currency.
2014
segment operating profit - decreased $1.3 billion, or 83% as compared to 2013. excluding the unfavorable impact of legal and regulatory settlement charges of 94 percentage points, higher restructuring charges recorded in 2014 of 3 percentage points, and a net gain related to the sale of an equity investment at crisil, aviation week and financial communications in 2013 of 2 percentage points, operating profit increased 16%. this increase was primarily due to strong revenue growth at s&p ratings, s&p capital iq and snl, s&p dj indices and c&c. see " - segment review" below for further information.
unallocated expense - decreased by $90 million or 35% as compared to 2013. excluding the favorable impact of costs necessary to enable the separation of mhe and reduce our cost structure recorded in 2013 of 27 percentage points, a loss related to the sale of a data center in 2013 of 15 percentage points, and charges related to a reduction in our real estate portfolio in 2013 of 5 percentage points, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of higher restructuring charges recorded in 2014 of 5 percentage points, unallocated expense increased 7%. this increase was primarily driven by the impact of a $9 million loss recorded in the second quarter of 2014 related to the sale of the company's aircraft and the sale of our data center, and an increase in unoccupied office space.
34
foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact on operating profit of 2 percentage points. the favorable impact on 2014 was driven by the devaluation of the argentinian peso as well as early strength of the british pound.
interest expense, net net interest expense for 2015 increased 73% as compared to 2014, primarily as a result of higher interest expense related to the $700 million of senior notes issued in the second quarter of 2015 and the $2.0 billion of senior notes issued in the third quarter of 2015. net interest expense for 2014 remained relatively flat as compared to 2013, decreasing 1%.
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate from continuing operations was 30.1%, 453.7% and 32.7% for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the decrease in the 2015 effective tax rate was primarily due to the reduction in charges for legal settlements, improved profitability in several lower tax jurisdictions outside of the united states, and continuing resolution of prior year tax audits. the increase in the 2014 effective tax rate from the prior year period was primarily due to the expected tax treatment of charges for legal settlements in 2014.
discontinued operations, net income from discontinued operations was $178 million in 2014 as compared to $592 million in 2013, primarily as a result of the after-tax gains of $160 million and $589 million recorded on the sale of mcgraw hill construction in 2014 and the sale of mhe in 2013, respectively.
segment review standard & poor's ratings services credit ratings are one of several tools that investors can use when making decisions about purchasing bonds and other fixed income investments. they are opinions about credit risk and our ratings express our opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer, such as a corporation or state or city government, to meet its financial obligations in full and on time. our credit ratings can also relate to the credit quality of an individual debt issue, such as a corporate or municipal bond, and the relative likelihood that the issuer may default.
s&p ratings differentiates its revenue between transaction and non-transaction. transaction revenue primarily includes fees associated with:
•   ratings related to new issuance of corporate and government debt instruments, and structured finance debt instruments;
•   bank loan ratings; and
•   corporate credit estimates, which are intended, based on an abbreviated analysis, to provide an indication of our opinion regarding creditworthiness of a company which does not currently have an s&amp;p ratings credit rating.
non-transaction revenue primarily includes fees for surveillance of a credit rating, annual fees for customer relationship-based pricing programs, fees for entity credit ratings and global research and analytics. non-transaction revenue also includes an intersegment royalty charged to s&p capital iq and snl for the rights to use and distribute content and data developed by s&p ratings. royalty revenue for 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $83 million, $77 million and $72 million, respectively.

1   2015 includes legal settlements, partially offset by a benefit related to insurance recoveries of $54 million and restructuring charges of approximately $13 million. 2014 includes $1.6 billion of legal and regulatory settlements and restructuring charges of approximately $45 million. 2013 includes $77 million of legal settlements, restructuring charges of approximately $10 million, and a $16 million gain on the sale of an equity investment held by crisil.
2015
revenue decreased 1%, which includes the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates that reduced revenue by 4 percentage points. excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, transaction revenue increased primarily due to an increase in u.s. public finance issuance, partially offset by a decline in structured finance revenue driven by reduced global market issuance. excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, non-transaction revenue also increased due to growth in surveillance revenues and additional ratings evaluation service activity, partially offset by lower revenue associated with new client relationships.
operating profit increased 285%. excluding the favorable net impact of legal and regulatory settlement charges and insurance recoveries of 273 percentage points and net higher restructuring costs recorded in 2014 of 6 percentage points, operating profit increased 7%. foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point on the operating profit growth of 7%. this increase was driven by decreased compensation costs primarily driven by lower incentive costs and cost containment resulting from 2014 restructuring actions and reduced legal fees following the resolution of a number of significant legal matters, partially offset by increased costs related to the implementation of the dodd-frank wall street reform of the consumer protection act and the decrease in revenue discussed above.
2014
revenue increased 8% driven by growth in both transaction and non-transaction revenue. transaction revenue increased in 2014 primarily driven by growth in both corporate and financial services bond ratings revenue with strong growth in all regions and an increase in bank loan ratings revenue, partially offset by a decline in structured finance revenues. non-transaction revenue increased primarily due to an increase in annual fees, increases in global research and analytics services and increased res activity.
operating profit decreased 166%. excluding the unfavorable impact of legal and regulatory settlements of 173 percentage points, the unfavorable impact of higher restructuring charges recorded in 2014 of 4 percentage points, and the unfavorable impact of the gain on sale of an equity investment held at crisil in 2013 of 2 percentage points, operating profit increased 13%. this increase was driven by the increase in revenue and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates of 2 percentage points, partially offset by higher legal defense costs primarily driven by increased litigation activity including the department of justice case.

issuance volumes we monitor issuance volumes as an indicator of trends in transaction revenue streams within s&p ratings. issuance volumes noted within the discussion that follows are based on the domicile of the issuer. issuance volumes can be reported in two ways: by "domicile", which is based on where an issuer is located or where the assets associated with an issue are located, or based on "marketplace", which is where the bonds are sold. the following tables depict changes in issuance levels as compared to the prior year, based on thomson financial, harrison scott publications, dealogic and s&p rating's internal estimates.

•   although the number of issuances were down, par value of corporate issuance in the u.s. was up in 2015 driven by an increase in investment-grade debt issuance reflecting high par value deals, as the number of deals was lower in the first nine months of the year. strong m&amp;a activity was a major driver of large financing transactions that resulted in increased issuance in the first nine months of the year. investment-grade debt issuance was negatively impacted in the fourth quarter of 2015 as market volatility increased. the increase in u.s. investment-grade debt issuance was partially offset by weakness in u.s. high-yield debt issuance.
•   corporate issuance in europe for both investment-grade and high-yield decreased in 2015 as a result of economic and political uncertainty in the european markets.

•   abs issuance in the u.s. was down, primarily driven by a decline in credit cards as banks continued to use deposit funding rather than securitization for alternative funding. abs issuance in europe was also down, driven by declines across several sub-asset classes.
•   issuance was down in the u.s. and european structured credit markets driven by lower availability of leveraged loans and overall market volatility.
•   cmbs issuance in the u.s. was up reflecting favorable market conditions and investor demand during the first half of the year, partially offset by a decline in the second half of the year with the mix reflecting a lower proportion of single borrower transactions. european cmbs issuance was also up, although from a low 2014 base.
•   rmbs volume in the u.s. was up driven by a mix of deal types, including servicing advance transactions. the increase in european rmbs volume was predominantly driven by an increase in the average issuance size.
•   covered bond issuance (which are debt securities backed by mortgages or other high-quality assets that remain on the issuer's balance sheet) in europe was up due to historically low yields. the european central bank's purchase program is also adding to the demand side, with banks and financial institutions taking advantage of attractive lower rates.

industry highlights and outlook revenue declined in 2015 primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates of 4 percentage points and reduced market issuance internationally primarily impacting corporate bond ratings revenue and structured finance revenues. these decreases were partially offset by an increase in u.s. public finance issuance in the first nine months of the year as issuers took advantage of the low interest rate environment. however, issuance slowed in the fourth quarter of 2015 due to market volatility. corporate bond ratings revenue in the u.s. was favorably impacted by the low interest rate environment and m&a activity throughout the first nine months of the year. however, issuance declined in the fourth quarter of 2015 as market volatility increased and m&a activity slowed. debt issuance is expected to continue to be volatile in 2016. m&a activity is expected to continue across the ratings spectrum. international economic and political uncertainties are likely to continue to cause market volatility in 2016.
legal and regulatory environment legal and regulatory environment general s&p ratings and many of the securities that it rates are subject to extensive regulation in both the u.s. and in other countries, and therefore existing and proposed laws and regulations can impact the company's operations and the markets in which it operates. additional laws and regulations have been adopted but not yet implemented or have been proposed or are being considered. in addition, in certain countries, governments may provide financial or other support to locally-based rating agencies. for example, governments may from time to time establish official rating agencies or credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers. we have reviewed the new laws, regulations and rules which have been adopted and we have implemented, or are planning to implement, changes as required. we do not believe that such new laws, regulations or rules will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. other laws, regulations and rules relating to credit rating agencies are being considered by local, national, foreign and multinational bodies and are likely to continue to be considered in the future, including provisions seeking to reduce regulatory and investor reliance on credit ratings, rotation of credit rating agencies and liability standards applicable to credit rating agencies. the impact on us of the adoption of any such laws, regulations or rules remains uncertain, but could increase the costs and legal risks relating to s&p ratings' rating activities, or adversely affect our ability to compete, or result in changes in the demand for credit ratings.
in the normal course of business both in the u.s. and abroad, s&p ratings (or the legal entities comprising s&p ratings) are defendants in numerous legal proceedings and are often the subject of government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries. many of these proceedings, investigations and inquiries relate to the ratings activity of s&p ratings brought by purchasers of rated securities. in addition, various government and self-regulatory agencies frequently make inquiries and conduct investigations into s&p ratings' compliance with applicable laws and regulations. any of these proceedings, investigations or inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments, damages, fines, penalties or activity restrictions, which could adversely impact our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business or competitive position.
u.s.
the businesses conducted by our s&p ratings segment are, in certain cases, regulated under the credit rating agency reform act of 2006 (the "reform act"), the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act (the "dodd frank act"), the securities exchange act of 1934 (the "exchange act") and/or the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which they conduct business. the financial services industry is subject to the potential for increased regulation in the u.s.
s&p ratings is a credit rating agency that is registered with the sec as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization ("nrsro"). the sec first began informally designating nrsros in 1975 for use of their credit ratings in the determination of capital charges for registered brokers and dealers under the sec's net capital rule. the reform act created a new sec registration system for rating agencies that choose to register as nrsros. under the reform act, the sec is given authority and oversight of nrsros and can censure nrsros, revoke their registration or limit or suspend their registration in certain cases. the rules implemented by the sec pursuant to the reform act, the dodd frank act and the exchange act address, among other things, prevention or misuse of material non-public information, conflicts of interest, documentation and assessment of internal controls, and improving transparency of ratings performance and methodologies. the public portions of the current version of s&p ratings' form nrsro are available on s&p ratings' web site.

european union in the european union, the credit rating industry is registered and supervised through a pan-european regulatory framework which is a compilation of three sets of legislative actions. in 2009, the european parliament passed a regulation ("cra1") that established an oversight regime for the credit rating industry in the european union, which became effective in 2010. cra1 requires the registration, formal regulation and periodic inspection of credit rating agencies operating in the european union. s&p ratings was granted registration in october of 2011. in january of 2011, the european union established the european securities and markets authority ("esma"), which, among other things, has direct supervisory responsibility for the registered credit rating industry throughout the european union.
additional rules augmenting the supervisory framework for credit rating agencies went into effect in 2013. commonly referred to as cra3, these rules, among other things:
•   impose various additional procedural requirements with respect to ratings of sovereign issuers;
•   require member states to adopt laws imposing liability on credit rating agencies for an intentional or grossly negligent failure to abide by the applicable regulations;
•   impose mandatory rotation requirements on credit rating agencies hired by issuers of securities for ratings of resecuritizations, which may limit the number of years a credit rating agency can issue ratings for such securities of a particular issuer;
•   impose restrictions on credit rating agencies or their shareholders if certain ownership thresholds are crossed; and
•   impose additional procedural and substantive requirements on the pricing of services.
the financial services industry is subject to the potential for increased regulation in the european union.
other jurisdictions outside of the u.s. and the european union, regulators and government officials have also been implementing formal oversight of credit rating agencies. s&p ratings is subject to regulations in several foreign jurisdictions in which it operates and continues to work closely with regulators globally to promote the global consistency of regulatory requirements. s&p ratings expects regulators in additional countries to introduce new regulations in the future.

1   2015 includes acquisition costs of $37 million related to the acquisition of snl and costs of $32 million related to identified operating efficiencies primarily related to restructuring. 2014 includes restructuring charges of $9 million. 2013 includes restructuring charges of approximately $9 million and a loss related to the sale of financial communications of $3 million.
2015
revenue increased 14% primarily due to 7 percentage points of growth in the s&p capital iq desktop, ratingsxpress® and ratingsdirect® and 7 percentage points from the acquisition of snl. revenue growth of the legacy s&p capital iq products was primarily driven by increases in average contract values for each product from new customer relationships and increases from existing accounts. these increases were partially offset by declines in the equity research business, the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates which reduced revenue by 1 percentage point and the unfavorable impact related to the closure of a non-core business. the number of users on the s&p capital iq desktop and the number of customers at ratingsxpress® continued to grow in 2015. ratingsxpress® continued to benefit from increased compliance requirements which have created a greater need for alternative risk tools. international revenue grew 10% over 2014, primarily driven by sales growth of the s&p capital iq desktop and ratingsxpress® in europe and asia.
operating profit remained flat. excluding the unfavorable impact of acquisition-related costs related to the acquisition of snl of 16 percentage points and higher costs recorded in 2015 related to identified operating efficiencies primarily related to restructuring of 10 percentage points, operating profit increased 25%. this increase is due to revenue growth and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates of 7 percentage points, partially offset by higher technology costs, increased compensation costs and higher intangible asset amortization in 2015 related to the acquisition of snl.
2014
revenue increased 6% primarily due to growth from the s&p capital iq desktop, ratingsxpress® and ratingsdirect®, driven by increases in average contract values for each product from new customer relationships and increases from existing accounts. this was partially offset by an unfavorable impact related to the closure of several non-core businesses. the number of users on the s&p capital iq desktop and the number of customers at ratingsxpress® increased in 2014 as compared to 2013. increases for existing accounts were driven by bundled solution offerings integrated within the s&p capital iq desktop, new datasets and expanded coverage of existing datasets combined with improved functionality of the s&p capital iq desktop. ratingsxpress® benefited from improvements made to the speed and timeliness through delivery on the xpressfeed platform. additionally, ratingsxpress® benefited from increased compliance requirements which have created a greater need for alternative risk tools. ratingsdirect® also had revenue growth in 2014 as increased contract values were driven by the sale of bundled packages including the s&p capital iq desktop. additionally, s&p capital iq desktop, ratingsxpress® and ratingsdirect® benefited in 2014 from a higher customer retention rate compared to 2013. international revenue grew 6% over 2013, primarily driven by sales growth of the s&p capital iq desktop in europe, asia and canada.
40
operating profit increased 21%. excluding the favorable impact of a loss related to the sale of financial communications of 3 percentage points, operating profit increased 18%. this increase is due to revenue growth, expense savings from the closure of several non-core businesses and a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates of 4 percentage points. partially offsetting the increases to operating profit were increased compensation costs, primarily due to improved sales performance and additional headcount in developing regions, and higher technology costs.
industry highlights and outlook in 2015, s&p capital iq and snl added scale to data, technology and commercial capabilities and created synergies with the existing legacy s&p capital iq portfolio through the acquisition of snl.
in 2016, s&p capital iq and snl will continue to focus on meeting or exceeding targeted revenue and costs synergies as a result of the acquisition of snl. the segment will seek to develop new products, further penetrate core customer segments and geographies, as well as enhance core capabilities in data, technology and market approach.

1   2014 includes $4 million of professional fees largely related to corporate development activities.
2015
revenue at s&p dj indices increased 8%, primarily driven by higher average levels of assets under management ("aum") for etfs and mutual funds. volumes for exchange-traded derivatives continued to increase for certain products which also contributed to revenue growth. additionally, the year-over-year revenue increase was slightly unfavorably impacted by the refinement of our process for estimating revenue for certain products that favorably impacted 2014 which caused a one-time revenue increase in the prior-year period. ending aum for etfs decreased 2% to $815 billion in 2015 from $832 billion in 2014, primarily due to the flow of investment funds to the developed international equity markets and the impact of lower equity prices. the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by 1 percentage point.
operating profit grew 13%. excluding the favorable impact of professional fees largely related to corporate development activities recorded in 2014 of 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 12%. this increase was primarily due to revenue growth as expenses remained relatively flat as a result of cost containment measures.
2014
revenue at s&p dj indices increased 12%, primarily driven by higher average levels of aum for etfs and mutual funds. higher volumes for exchange-traded derivatives also contributed to revenue growth. these increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of lower over-the-counter derivative trading volumes in 2014 driven by the expiration of a licensing arrangement for commodities indices in june of 2014. aum for etfs rose 25% to $832 billion in 2014 from $668 billion in 2013. the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by less than 1 percentage point.
42
operating profit grew 30%. excluding the impact of professional fees largely related to corporate development activities recorded in 2014 of 2 percentage points, operating profit increased 32%. this increase was primarily due revenue growth and the favorable impact of a $26 million non-cash impairment charge recorded in 2013 associated with an intangible asset acquired with the formation of the s&p dow jones indices llc joint venture and a reduction of royalty expenses. the reduction of royalty expenses was the result of purchases of intellectual property rights to certain commodities indices developed by goldman sachs, and broad market indices ("bmi") from citigroup global markets inc. as well as the expiration of a licensing arrangement for commodities indices in june of 2014. these expense reductions were partially offset by an increase in compensation costs related to additional headcount and higher incentive costs. the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates reduced operating profit by 1 percentage point.
industry highlights and outlook s&p dj indices continues to be the leading index provider for the etf market space. in 2015, higher average levels of aum for etfs contributed to revenue growth, however, ending aum for etfs decreased 2% to $815 billion in 2015 from $832 billion in 2014. s&p dj indices will also seek to diversify their portfolio of index offerings through asset class expansion, new geographies, and investment strategies. this group will seek to expand its fixed income offering and grow its local presence in emerging markets.
legal and regulatory environment the financial benchmarks industry is subject to the new pending benchmark regulation in the european union (the "e.u. benchmark regulation") as well as potential increased regulation in other jurisdictions.
the proposed e.u. benchmark regulation has been released for final approval and is expected to be published later this year. the e.u. benchmark regulation will likely require s&p dj indices in due course to obtain registration or authorization in connection with its benchmark activities in europe. this legislation will likely cause additional operating obligations but they are not expected to be material at this time and until the regulation is finalized the exact impact is not certain.
in addition, the european union has recently finalized a package of legislative measures known as mifid ii, which revise and update the existing e.u. markets in financial instruments directive framework. mifid ii will apply in full in all e.u. member states from january 3, 2017. mifid ii includes provisions that, among other things: (i) impose new conditions and requirements on the licensing of benchmarks and provide for non-discriminatory access to exchanges and clearing houses; (ii) modify the categorization and treatment of certain classes of derivatives; (iii) expand the categories of trading venue that are subject to regulation; and (iv) provide for the mandatory trading of certain derivatives on exchanges (complementing the mandatory derivative clearing requirements in the e.u. market infrastructure regulation of 2011). although the mifid ii package is "framework" legislation (meaning that much of the detail of the rules will be set out in subordinate measures to be agreed upon in the period before 2017), it is possible that the introduction of these laws and rules could affect s&p dj indices' ability both to administer and license its indices.
in july of 2013, the international organization of securities commissions ("iosco") issued financial benchmark principles, which are intended to promote the reliability of benchmark determinations, and address governance, benchmark quality and accountability mechanisms, including with regard to the indices published by s&p dj indices. even though the financial benchmark principles are not binding law, s&p dj indices has taken steps to align its governance regime and operations with the financial benchmark principles and engaged an independent auditor to perform a reasonable assurance review of such alignment.
the markets for index providers are very competitive. s&p dj indices competes domestically and internationally on the basis of a number of factors, including the quality of its benchmark indices, client service, reputation, price, range of products and services (including geographic coverage) and technological innovation. for a further discussion of competitive and other risks inherent in our s&p dj indices business, see item 1a, risk factors, in this annual report on form 10-k.
commodities & commercial c&c consists of business-to-business companies specializing in the commodities and commercial markets that deliver their customers access to high-value information, data, analytic services and pricing and quality benchmarks. c&c includes the following brands:
•   platts - provides essential price data, analytics, and industry insight that enable commodities markets to perform with greater transparency and efficiency; and
43
•   j.d. power - provides essential consumer intelligence to help businesses measure, understand, and improve the key performance metrics that drive growth and profitability.
in the fourth quarter of 2015, we began exploring strategic alternatives for j.d. power, included in our c&c segment. we committed to and initiated an active program to sell j.d. power in its current state that we believe is probable in the next year. as a result, we have classified the assets and liabilities of j.d. power as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2015. the anticipated disposal does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on operations and financial results, therefore, it is not classified as a discontinued operation.
on november 3, 2014, we completed the sale of mcgraw hill construction, which has historically been part of our c&c segment, to symphony technology group for $320 million in cash. accordingly, the results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2014 and all prior periods presented have been reclassified to reflect the business as a discontinued operation. see note 2 - acquisitions and divestitures for further discussion.
the c&c business is driven by the need for high-value information and transparency in a variety of industries. c&c seeks to deliver premier content that is deeply embedded in customer workflows and decision making processes.
c&c's revenue is generated primarily through the following sources:
•   subscription revenue - subscriptions to our real-time news, market data and price assessments, along with other information products, primarily serving the energy and automotive industry; and
•   non-subscription revenue - primarily from licensing of our proprietary market price data and price assessments to commodity exchanges, syndicated and proprietary research studies, commercial-oriented data and analytics, conference sponsorship, consulting engagements, and events.
as of august 1, 2013, we completed the sale of aviation week and results have been included in c&c's results through that date. see note 2 - acquisitions and divestitures to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

2015
revenue grew 9% driven by strength in platts' proprietary content as platts' revenue grew across all regions. this growth was mainly due to continued demand for platts' market data and price assessment products across all commodity sectors, led by petroleum. while petroleum is still the biggest driver, the revenue mix continues to become more diversified as other sectors showed positive annualized contract value growth including natural gas, petrochemicals, metals and agriculture. additionally, growth has been driven by the continued licensing of our proprietary market price data and price assessments to various commodity exchanges. platts' revenue for 2015 was also favorably impacted by the acquisitions of eclipse energy group as and its operating subsidiaries ("eclipse") in july of 2014 and petromedia ltd and its operating subsidiaries ("petromedia") in july of 2015. j.d. power also contributed to the revenue increase driven by an increase in auto consulting engagements in the u.s., growth in the u.s. power information network® ("pin") business and the acquisition of national automobile dealers association's used car guide ("ucg") in july of 2015. the acquisitions of eclipse, petromedia and ucg had a favorable impact on revenue of 3 percentage points. see note 2 - acquisitions and divestitures for further discussion. the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by 1 percentage point.
operating profit increased 23%. excluding the favorable impact of higher restructuring charges recorded in 2014 of 6 percentage points, operating profit increased 17%. this increase is due to the increase in revenue and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates of 4 percentage points, partially offset by higher incentive costs and outside consulting fees at platts and higher compensation costs related to additional headcount at j.d. power due to the acquisition of ucg.
2014
revenue increased 6% due to continued demand for platts' proprietary content as platts' revenue grew across all regions. this growth was mainly driven by strength in platts' market data and price assessment products across all commodity sectors, led by petroleum. while petroleum is still the biggest driver, the revenue mix continues to become more diversified as other sectors continued to show positive annualized contract value growth including petrochemicals, natural gas, coal, metals and agriculture. platts' revenue in 2014 was also favorably impacted by the acquisition of eclipse in july of 2014. the acquisition of eclipse had a favorable impact on revenue of less than 1 percentage point. see note 2 - acquisitions and divestitures for further discussion. additionally, growth at j.d. power also contributed to the revenue increase driven by strong demand for auto consulting engagements in the u.s. and singapore and growth in the u.s. pin business. the increases in revenue were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of 3 percentage points related to the sale of aviation week on august 1, 2013 as the results have been included in c&c's results through that date.
operating profit increased 3%. excluding the unfavorable impact of the pre-tax gain on the sale of aviation week recorded in 2013 of 4 percentage points and higher restructuring charges recorded in 2014 as compared to 2013 of 3 percentage points, operating profit increased 10%. this increase is due to the increase in revenue, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates of 1 percentage point, increased costs at platts and j.d. power related to additional headcount, merit increases, and other operating costs to support business growth.
industry highlights and outlook c&c expects to continue to invest in digital capabilities that will enable our brands to become more integrated in our customers' workflows, compete more effectively in the marketplace, and create a foundation for the development of new products and revenue streams. the segment expects to further expand its presence in selected markets and geographies to help drive growth.
high growth in supply and an uncertain pace of demand growth causes volatility in energy prices, which will drive market participant demand for platts' proprietary content, including news, price assessments and analytics. however, if commodity prices remain at levels that are lower than in recent years, this is likely to have an adverse impact on the rate of growth for subscription and conference revenue in some of platts' customer segments. the international energy agency ("iea"), in its first monthly forecast of 2016, predicted that world oil consumption will rise to 95.7 million barrels per day in 2016, a gain of 1.2 million barrels per day compared to 2015. the iea expected non-opec total liquids supply to contract by nearly 600,000 barrels per day in 2016, following growth of 1.4 million barrels per day in 2015. in 2016, platts will continue to invest in technology and customer engagement activities to seek to drive additional revenue growth across all commodity sectors. they will also seek to continue to leverage the capabilities and content from recent acquisitions and expand into adjacent markets. similar to 2015, they expect to continue to introduce a number of new products and price assessments within all commodity sectors. platts completed its first annual assurance review confirming adherence to the iosco principles for oil price reporting agencies (pras) for its oil benchmarks in 2013 and, as of december 2015, had completed its fourth assurance review confirming its alignment with the pra principles for both its oil and non-oil commodity benchmarks. on september 17, 2015, iosco announced that the pras have made the iosco pra principles an "integral part" of their price assessment practices and that iosco saw no need to continue its annual review of the principles' implementation. platts remains committed to ensuring its price assessment processes continue
45
to fully align with the pra principles across all commodities and will continue to retain an independent accountancy firm to conduct voluntary reasonable assurance reviews of its alignment to the pra principles.
demand for our automotive studies is driven by the performance of the automotive industry. in 2015, global and u.s. light vehicle sales increased approximately 1% and 6%, respectively, compared to 2014, with growth across most primary markets partially offset by decreases from russia, brazil and japan. for 2016, j.d. power projects growth for global and u.s. light vehicles sales of 4% and 2%, respectively. in 2016, j.d. power will strive to grow the core business by strengthening their benchmark studies, leveraging new initiatives to drive operational efficiencies and enhance customer delivery and increasing the distribution of their syndicated studies. international growth will continue to be a key focus in 2016 as they will look to extend product offerings to increase penetration in the asia-pacific region and exploring growth opportunities in target growth markets (china, brazil and mexico).
legal and regulatory environment platts' commodities price assessment and information business is subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny in the u.s. and abroad. as discussed above under the heading "s&p dj indices-legal and regulatory environment", the financial benchmarks industry is subject to the new pending benchmark regulation in the european union (the "e.u. benchmark regulation") as well as potential increased regulation in other jurisdictions. as a result of these measures, as well as measures that could be taken in other jurisdictions outside of europe, platts will likely be required in due course to obtain registration or authorization in connection with its benchmark and price assessment activities in europe and potentially elsewhere.
also as discussed above under the heading "s&p dj indices-legal and regulatory environment", the european union has recently finalized a package of legislative measures known as mifid ii, which may also impact platts' business. although the mifid ii package is "framework" legislation, it is possible that the introduction of these laws and rules could affect platts' ability both to administer and license its price assessments.
in october of 2012, iosco issued its pra principles which set out principles, which are intended to enhance the reliability of oil price assessments referenced in derivative contracts subject to regulation by iosco members. platts has taken steps to align its operations with the pra principles and as recommended by iosco in its final report on the pra principles, has aligned to the pra principles for other commodities for which it publishes benchmarks.
the markets for commodities price assessments and information are very competitive. platts competes domestically and internationally on the basis of a number of factors, including the quality of its assessments and other information it provides to the commodities and related markets, client service, reputation, price, range of products and services (including geographic coverage) and technological innovation. furthermore, sustained downward pressure on oil and other commodities prices and trading activity in those markets could have a material adverse impact on the rate of growth of platts' revenue. for a further discussion of competitive and other risks inherent in our platts business, see item 1a, risk factors, in this annual report on form 10-k.
liquidity and capital resources we continue to maintain a strong financial position. our primary source of funds for operations is cash from our businesses and our core businesses have been strong cash generators. in 2016, cash on hand, cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facility are expected to be sufficient to meet any additional operating and recurring cash needs into the foreseeable future. we use our cash for a variety of needs, including among others: ongoing investments in our businesses, strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends, repayment of debt, capital expenditures and investment in our infrastructure.
cash flow overview cash and cash equivalents were $1.5 billion as of december 31, 2015, a decrease of $1.0 billion as compared to december 31, 2014, and consisted of approximately 10% of domestic cash and 90% of cash held abroad. typically, cash held outside the u.s. is anticipated to be utilized to fund international operations or to be reinvested outside of the u.s., as a significant portion of our opportunities for growth in the coming years is expected to be abroad. in the event funds from international operations are needed to fund operations in the u.s., we would be required to accrue for and pay taxes in the u.s. to repatriate these funds.

in 2015, free cash flow decreased to $(48.0) million compared to $1.0 billion in 2014. the decrease is primarily due to the decrease in cash provided from operating activities as discussed below. free cash flow is a non-gaap financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and dividends and other payments paid to noncontrolling interests. capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects. see "mda - reconciliation of non-gaap financial information" below for a reconciliation of cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable u.s. gaap financial measure, to free cash flow.
operating activities cash provided by operating activities decreased $1.0 billion to $195 million in 2015. the decrease is mainly due to the payment of legal and regulatory settlements in 2015 of $1.6 billion.
cash provided by operating activities increased $427 million to $1.2 billion in 2014. the increase is mainly due to a tax refund received in the first quarter of 2014 related to an overpayment in 2013 and the timing of our estimated tax payment which was made in the first quarter of 2013 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. additionally, improved collections in 2014 impacting accounts receivable also contributed to the increase. these increases were partially offset by higher incentive payments in 2014 compared to 2013.
investing activities our cash outflows from investing activities are primarily for acquisitions and capital expenditures, while cash inflows are primarily proceeds from dispositions.
cash used for investing activities increased to $2.5 billion for 2015 from $65 million in 2014, primarily due to the acquisition of snl in september of 2015.
cash used for investing activities decreased to $65 million for 2014 from $130 million in 2013. this was primarily due to higher proceeds from dispositions in 2014 related to the sale of our data center to qts and proceeds from the sale of the company's aircraft. additionally, lower capital expenditures in 2014 compared to 2013 contributed to the decrease. these decreases were partially offset by a higher amount of cash paid for acquisitions in 2014 compared to 2013.
refer to note 2 - acquisitions and divestitures to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
financing activities our cash outflows from financing activities consist primarily of share repurchases, dividends and repayment of debt, while cash inflows are primarily inflows from long-term and short-term debt borrowings and proceeds from the exercise of stock options.
cash provided by financing activities was $1.5 billion in 2015 compared to cash used for financing activities of $462 million in 2014, driven by proceeds from the issuance of senior notes in 2015, partially offset by an increase in cash used for the repurchase of treasury shares.
cash used for financing activities decreased $1.3 billion to $462 million in 2014. this decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in cash used for share repurchases and the repayment of short-term debt that occurred in the first quarter of 2013.
during 2015, we used cash to repurchase 9.8 million shares for $974 million at an average price paid per share of $98.98, excluding commissions. an additional 0.3 million shares were repurchased in the fourth quarter of 2015 for approximately $26 million, which settled in january of 2016. including these additional shares, we utilized cash to repurchase shares at an average price of $99.00, excluding commissions.
during 2014, we used cash to repurchase 4.6 million shares for $362 million at an average price paid per share of $79.02, excluding commissions. included in the repurchase were 0.5 million shares of the company's common stock from the personal holdings of harold w. mcgraw iii, then chairman of the company's board of directors and former president and ceo of the company ("mr.
47
mcgraw") the shares were purchased at a discount of 0.35% from the june 24, 2014 new york stock exchange closing price pursuant to a private transaction with mr. mcgraw. we repurchased these shares with cash for $41 million at an average price of $82.66 per share. this transaction was approved by the nominating and corporate governance committee of the company's board of directors after consultation with members of the financial policy committee.
during 2013, we used cash to repurchase 16.8 million shares for $978 million, including commissions. the average price per share, excluding commissions, was $58.36. an additional 0.1 million shares were repurchased in the fourth quarter of 2013 for approximately $10 million, which settled in january of 2014. including these additional shares, we utilized cash to repurchase shares at an average price of $58.52, excluding commissions.
on december 4, 2013, the board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to 50 million shares (the "2013 repurchase program"), which was approximately 18% of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time. the 2013 repurchase program has no expiration date and purchases under this program may be made from time to time on the open market and in private transactions, depending on market conditions. as of december 31, 2015, 35.5 million shares remained available under the 2013 repurchase program.
discontinued operations cash flows from discontinued operations reflects the classification of mcgraw hill construction and mhe as discontinued operations.
cash used for operating activities from discontinued operations of $129 million in 2015 relates to the tax payment on the gain on sale of mcgraw hill construction. cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations of $18 million in 2014 relates to mcgraw hill construction and cash used for operating activities of $231 million in 2013 relates both to mhe and mcgraw hill construction.
cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations decreased to $320 million in 2014 compared to $2.1 billion in 2013 due to lower proceeds received from the sale of mcgraw hill construction compared to the proceeds received from mhe.
cash used for financing activities decreased $25 million in 2014 as there was no impact related to mcgraw hill construction.
additional financing we have the ability to borrow a total of $1.2 billion through our commercial paper program, which is supported by our credit facility described below. commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of december 31, 2015 totaled $143 million with an average interest rate and term of 0.95% and 17 days. as of december 31, 2015, we can borrow approximately $1.1 billion in additional funds through the commercial paper program. there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding under our credit facility as of december 31, 2014.
on june 30, 2015, we entered into a revolving $1.2 billion five-year credit agreement (our "credit facility") that will terminate on june 30, 2020. this credit facility replaced our $1.0 billion four-year credit facility that was scheduled to terminate on june 19, 2017. the previous credit facility was canceled immediately after the new credit facility became effective. there were no outstanding borrowings under the previous credit facility when it was replaced.
we pay a commitment fee of 10 to 20 basis points for our credit facility, depending on our indebtedness to cash flow ratio, whether or not amounts have been borrowed and currently pay a commitment fee of 15 basis points. the interest rate on borrowings under our credit facility is, at our option, calculated using rates that are primarily based on either the prevailing london inter-bank offered rate, the prime rate determined by the administrative agent or the federal funds rate. for certain borrowings under this credit facility, there is also a spread based on our indebtedness to cash flow ratio added to the applicable rate.
our credit facility contains certain covenants. the only financial covenant requires that our indebtedness to cash flow ratio, as defined in our credit facility, is not greater than 4 to 1, and this covenant level has never been exceeded.
on july 24, 2015, in connection with the acquisition of snl, we entered into a commitment letter. upon receipt of the proceeds from the issuance of $2.0 billion of senior notes on august 18, 2015, we terminated this commitment letter. see note 5 - debt for further information.
on january 22, 2015, fitch ratings revised its ratings outlook from negative to stable and affirmed our bbb+ long-term debt rating and f2 short-term/commercial debt rating. on august 7, 2015, moody's investor service assigned a baa1 long-term debt rating and p-2 commercial paper rating.

dividends on january 27, 2016, the board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly common stock dividend from $0.33 per share to $0.36 per share.
contractual obligations we typically have various contractual obligations, which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, while other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts, are not recognized, but are disclosed herein. for example, we are contractually committed to contracts for information-technology outsourcing, certain enterprise-wide information-technology software licensing and maintenance and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements.
we believe that the amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash flow expected from operations and availability under our credit facility will be adequate for us to execute our business strategy and meet anticipated requirements for lease obligations, capital expenditures, working capital and debt service for 2016.
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31, 2015, over the next several years that relate to our continuing operations. additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, as referenced in the footnotes to the table:

3   other consists primarily of commitments for unconditional purchase obligations in contracts for information-technology outsourcing and certain enterprise-wide information-technology software licensing and maintenance.
as of december 31, 2015, we had $120 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. we have excluded the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits from our contractual obligations table because reasonable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities are not practicable.
as of december 31, 2015, we have recorded $920 million for our redeemable noncontrolling interest in our s&p dow jones indices llc partnership discussed in note 8 - equity to our consolidated financial statements.  specifically, this amount relates to the put option under the terms of the operating agreement of s&p dow jones indices llc, whereby, after december 31, 2017, cme group and cme group index services llc ("cgis") will have the right at any time to sell, and we are obligated to buy, at least 20% of their share in s&p dow jones indices llc. we have excluded this amount from our contractual obligations table because we are uncertain as to the timing and the ultimate amount of the potential payment we may be required to make.
we make contributions to our pension and postretirement plans in order to satisfy minimum funding requirements as well as additional contributions that we consider appropriate to improve the funded status of our plans. during 2015, we contributed $15 million and $8 million to our domestic and international retirement and postretirement plans, respectively. expected employer contributions in 2016 are $7 million and $9 million for our domestic and international retirement and postretirement plans, respectively. in 2016, we may elect to make additional non-required contributions depending on investment performance and the pension plan status. see note 6 - employee benefits to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
49
off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities, such as entities often referred to as specific purpose or variable interest entities where we are the primary beneficiary, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. as such we are not exposed to any financial liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.
reconciliation of non-gaap financial information free cash flow is a non-gaap financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and dividends and other payments paid to noncontrolling interests. capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects. our cash flow provided by operating activities is the most directly comparable u.s. gaap financial measure to free cash flow. additionally, we have considered certain items in evaluating free cash flow, which are included in the table below.
we believe the presentation of free cash flow and free cash flow excluding certain items allows our investors to evaluate the cash generated from our underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management. we use free cash flow to conduct and evaluate our business because we believe it typically presents a more conservative measure of cash flows since capital expenditures and dividends and other payments paid to noncontrolling interests are considered a necessary component of ongoing operations. free cash flow is useful for management and investors because it allows management and investors to evaluate the cash available to us to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, repurchase stock and fund ongoing operation and working capital needs.
the presentation of free cash flow and free cash flow excluding certain items are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with u.s. gaap. free cash flow, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. the following table presents a reconciliation of our cash flow provided by operating activities to free cash flow excluding the impact of the items below:

critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. unless otherwise indicated, all discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations relate to our continuing operations.
on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, pension plans, incentive compensation and stock-based compensation, income taxes, contingencies and redeemable noncontrolling interests. we base our estimates on historical experience, current developments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under these circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that cannot readily be determined from other sources. there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates.
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it required assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations.
50
management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to them in this md&a.
we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
revenue recognition revenue is recognized as it is earned when services are rendered. we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are performed, fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. revenue relating to products that provide for more than one deliverable is recognized based upon the relative fair value to the customer of each deliverable as each deliverable is provided. revenue relating to agreements that provide for more than one service is recognized based upon the relative fair value to the customer of each service component as each component is earned. if the fair value to the customer for each service is not objectively determinable, we make our best estimate of the services' stand alone selling price and recognize revenue as earned as the services are delivered. the allocation of consideration received from multiple element arrangements that involve initial assignment of ratings and the future surveillance of ratings is determined through an analysis that considers cash consideration that would be received for instances when the service components are sold separately. in such cases, we defer portions of rating fees that we estimate will be attributed to future surveillance and recognize the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated surveillance periods. advertising revenue is recognized when the page is run. subscription income is recognized over the related subscription period.
for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, no significant changes have been made to the underlying assumptions related to estimates of revenue or the methodologies applied. based on our current outlook these assumptions are not expected to significantly change in 2016.
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve methodology is based on historical analysis, a review of outstanding balances and current conditions. in determining these reserves, we consider, amongst other factors, the financial condition and risk profile of our customers, areas of specific or concentrated risk as well as applicable industry trends or market indicators. the impact on operating profit for a one percentage point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts is approximately $10 million.
for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we made no material changes in our assumptions regarding the determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts. based on our current outlook these assumptions are not expected to significantly change in 2016.
accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets (including other intangible assets)
we evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. upon such an occurrence, recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to current forecasts of undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. for long-lived assets held for sale, assets are written down to fair value, less cost to sell. fair value is determined based on market evidence, discounted cash flows, appraised values or management's estimates, depending upon the nature of the assets.
on july 31, 2014, we completed the sale of the company's aircraft to harold w. mcgraw iii, then chairman of the company's board of directors and former president and ceo of the company for a purchase price of $20 million. during the second quarter of 2014, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $6 million within other (income) loss in our consolidated statement of income as a result of the pending sale. see note 13 - related party transactions to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
on june 30, 2014, we completed the sale of our data center to quality technology services, llc ("qts") which owns, operates, and manages data centers. net proceeds from the sale of $58 million were received in july of 2014. the sale includes all of the facilities and equipment on the south campus of our east windsor, new jersey location, inclusive of the rights and obligations associated with an adjoining solar power field. the sale resulted in an expense of $3 million recorded within other (income) loss in our consolidated statement of income, which is in addition to the non-cash impairment charge of $36 million we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013 to adjust the value facilities and associated infrastructure classified as held for sale to their fair value.
during the fourth quarter of 2013, we also incurred a $26 million non-cash impairment charge associated with an intangible asset acquired through the formation of our s&p dow jones indices llc joint venture.
51
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets was $3.6 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of snl in september of 2015. see note 2 - acquisitions and divestitures to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.
goodwill as part of our annual impairment test of our four reporting units, we initially perform a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount. our qualitative assessment included, but was not limited to, consideration of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, cash flows, changes in key company personnel and our share price. if, based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount, no quantitative impairment test is performed. conversely, if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its respective carrying amount we perform a two-step quantitative impairment test. for 2015, based on our qualitative assessments, we determined that it is more likely than not that our reporting units' fair value was greater than their respective carrying amounts.
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a second step is performed which compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill. the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value, the difference is recognized as an impairment charge.
indefinite-lived intangible assets we evaluate the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets by first performing a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired. if, based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired, no quantitative impairment test is performed. conversely, if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired a quantitative impairment test is performed. if necessary, the impairment test is performed by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value. if the indefinite-lived intangible asset carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment analysis is performed using the income approach. the fair value of loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. significant judgments inherent in these analyses include estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates, royalty rates and long-term growth rate assumptions. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for this indefinite-lived intangible asset and could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our financial position and results of operations.
we performed our impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at our s&p ratings, s&p capital iq and snl, s&p dj indices and c&c operating segments and concluded that no impairment existed for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013.
retirement plans and postretirement healthcare and other benefits our employee pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances, including compensation increases, long-term return on pension plan assets, healthcare cost trends, discount rates and other factors. in determining such assumptions, we consult with outside actuaries and other advisors where deemed appropriate. in accordance with relevant accounting standards, if actual results differ from our assumptions, such differences are deferred and amortized over the estimated remaining lifetime of the plan participants. while we believe that the assumptions used in these calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could affect the expense and liabilities related to our pension and other postretirement benefits.
the following is a discussion of some significant assumptions that we make in determining costs and obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits:
•   discount rate assumptions are based on current yields on high-grade corporate long-term bonds.
•   healthcare cost trend assumptions are based on historical market data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends.
52
•   the expected return on assets assumption is calculated based on the plan's asset allocation strategy and projected market returns over the long-term.
our discount rate and return on asset assumptions used to determine the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost on our u.s. retirement plans are as follows:
retirement plans                         postretirement plans january 1                                       2016           2015           2014           2016           2015           2014
discount rate 1                            4.47    %      4.15    %      5.00    %      3.90    %      3.60    %      4.20    %
return on assets                           6.25    %      6.25    %     7.125    %
weighted-average healthcare cost rate                                                   7.00    %      7.00    %      7.00    %
1   at the end of 2015, we changed our approach used to measure service and interest costs on all of our retirement plans. for 2015 and prior periods presented, we measured service and interest costs utilizing the single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation. for 2016, we elected to measure service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans' liability cash flows. we believe this new approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans' liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. this change does not affect the measurement of our benefit obligation. we have accounted for this change as a change in accounting estimate that is inseparable from a change in accounting principle and, accordingly, have accounted for it on a prospective basis. we expect pension and postretirement medical costs to decrease by approximately $13 million in 2016 as a result of this change.
in addition to the assumptions in the above table, assumed mortality is also a key assumption in determining benefit obligations. effective december 31, 2014, the company updated the assumed mortality rates to reflect life expectancy improvements.
stock-based compensation stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period, which typically is the vesting period. stock-based compensation is classified as both operating-related expense and selling and general expense in our consolidated statements of income.
we use a lattice-based option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted. the following assumptions were used in valuing the options granted:
years ended december 31,
2015   2014                      2013
risk-free average interest rate                            0.2 - 1.9%                0.1 - 2.9%                  0.1 - 2.9%
dividend yield                                                   1.4%                1.4 - 1.8%                2.07 - 2.09%
volatility                                                   21 - 39%                  18 - 41%                    29 - 45%
expected life (years)                                             6.3               6.21 - 6.25                   6.1 - 6.2
weighted-average grant-date fair value per option              $27.57                    $23.41                      $14.46
because lattice-based option-pricing models incorporate ranges of assumptions, those ranges are disclosed. these assumptions are based on multiple factors, including historical exercise patterns, post-vesting termination rates, expected future exercise patterns and the expected volatility of our stock price. the risk-free interest rate is the imputed forward rate based on the u.s. treasury yield at the date of grant. we use the historical volatility of our stock price over the expected term of the options to estimate the expected volatility. the expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the lattice model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in interest expense and operating expense, respectively.

judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits. in determining the need for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial performance of the operation that is recording a net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information.
we file income tax returns in the u.s. federal jurisdiction, various states, and foreign jurisdictions, and we are routinely under audit by many different tax authorities. we believe that our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law. this assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events. it is possible that examinations will be settled prior to december 31, 2016. if any of these tax audit settlements do occur within that period we would make any necessary adjustments to the accrual for unrecognized tax benefits. until formal resolutions are reached between us and the tax authorities, the determination of a possible audit settlement range with respect to the impact on unrecognized tax benefits is not practicable. on the basis of present information, it is our opinion that any assessments resulting from the current audits will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
we have determined that the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested within those foreign operations. accordingly, we have not provided deferred income taxes on these indefinitely reinvested earnings. a future distribution by the foreign subsidiaries of these earnings could result in additional tax liability, which may be material to our future reported results, financial position and cash flows.
for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we made no material changes in our assumptions regarding the determination of the provision for income taxes. however, certain events could occur that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions regarding deferred taxes. changes in current tax laws and applicable enacted tax rates could affect the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, thereby impacting our income tax provision.
contingencies we are subject to a number of lawsuits and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. we recognize a liability for such contingencies when both (a) information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (b) the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. we continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on an analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. because many of these matters are resolved over long periods of time, our estimate of liabilities may change due to new developments, changes in assumptions or changes in our strategy related to the matter. when we accrue for loss contingencies and the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range, we record its best estimate within the range. we disclose an estimated possible loss or a range of loss when it is at least reasonably possible that a loss may have been incurred.
redeemable noncontrolling interest the fair value component of the redeemable noncontrolling interest in s&p dj indices business is based on a combination of an income and market valuation approach. our income and market valuation approaches may incorporate level 3 measures for instances when observable inputs are not available, including assumptions related to expected future net cash flows, long-term growth rates, the timing and nature of tax attributes, and the redemption features.
recent accounting standards see note 1 - accounting policies, to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of recent accounting standards. we do not expect these recent accounting standards to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity in future periods.

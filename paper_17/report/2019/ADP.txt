item 1a. risk factors our businesses routinely encounter and address risks, some of which may cause our future results to be different than we currently anticipate. the risk factors described below represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our businesses and are important to understanding our business. the following information should be read in conjunction with management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form 10-k. this discussion includes a number of forward-looking statements. you should refer to the description of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements in the first paragraph under management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report on form 10-k. the level of importance of each of the following risks may vary from time to time, and any of these risks may have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
failure to comply with, or changes in, laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations or financial condition, or have other adverse consequences our business is subject to a wide range of complex u.s. and foreign laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the laws and regulations described in the "industry regulation" section in part i, item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our operations or client solutions and services could result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations, the limitation, suspension or termination of services, and the imposition of consent orders or civil and criminal penalties, including fines, that could damage our reputation and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition.
in addition, changes in laws or regulations, or changes in the interpretation of laws or regulations by a regulatory authority, may decrease our revenues and earnings and may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business. for example, a change in regulations either decreasing the amount of taxes to be withheld or allowing less time to remit taxes to government authorities would adversely impact average client balances and, thereby adversely impact interest income from investing client funds before such funds are remitted to the applicable taxing authorities. changes in taxation regulations could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our net income. changes in laws that govern the co-employment arrangement between a professional employer organization and its worksite employees may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our peo business. health care reform under the affordable care act, related state laws, and the regulations thereunder, as well as the uncertainty surrounding the affordable care act, have the potential to further impact the health insurance market for our peo business and the demand for our health care compliance solutions. we are unable to determine the additional impact that any of this will have on our peo business, our ability to attract and retain peo clients or demand for our health care compliance solutions.
amendments to money transmitter statutes have required us to obtain licenses in some jurisdictions. the adoption of new money transmitter statutes in other jurisdictions, changes in regulators' interpretation of existing state and federal money transmitter or money services business statutes or regulations, or disagreement by a regulatory authority with our interpretation of such statutes or regulations, could require additional registration or licensing, limit certain of our business activities until they are appropriately licensed, and expose us to financial penalties. these occurrences could also require changes to the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our money movement business or client funds investment strategy, which could adversely impact interest income from investing client funds before such funds are remitted.
failure to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations, economic and trade sanctions, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, and similar laws could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations or financial condition, or have other adverse consequences regulators worldwide are exercising heightened scrutiny with respect to anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. such heightened scrutiny has resulted in more aggressive investigations and enforcement of such laws and more burdensome regulations, any of which could materially adversely impact our business. we operate our business around the world, including in numerous developing economies where companies and government officials are more likely to engage in business practices that are prohibited by domestic and foreign laws and regulations, including the united states foreign corrupt practices act and the u.k. bribery act. such laws generally prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign government officials and leaders of political parties, and in some cases, to other persons, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. we are also subject to economic and trade sanctions programs, including those administered by the u.s. treasury department's office of foreign assets control, which prohibit or restrict transactions or dealings with specified countries, their governments and, in certain circumstances, their nationals, and with individuals and entities that are specially designated, including narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations, among others. in addition, some of our businesses in the u.s. and a number of countries in which we operate are subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including, for example, the bank secrecy act of 1970, as amended by the usa patriot act of 2000 (the "bsa"). among other things, the bsa
13
requires certain financial institutions, including banks and money services businesses (such as money transmitters and providers of prepaid access), to develop and implement risk-based anti-money laundering programs, report large cash transactions and suspicious activity, and maintain transaction records. we have registered our payroll card business with the treasury department's financial crimes enforcement network ("fincen") as a provider of prepaid access pursuant to a fincen regulation.
we have implemented policies and procedures to monitor and address compliance with applicable anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions and anti-money laundering laws and regulations, and we are continuously in the process of reviewing, upgrading and enhancing certain of our policies and procedures. however, there can be no assurance that our employees, consultants or agents will not take actions in violation of our policies for which we may be ultimately responsible, or that our policies and procedures will be adequate or will be determined to be adequate by regulators. any violations of applicable anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions or anti-money laundering laws or regulations could limit certain of our business activities until they are satisfactorily remediated and could result in civil and criminal penalties, including fines, which could damage our reputation and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition. further, bank regulators are imposing additional and stricter requirements on banks to ensure they are meeting their bsa obligations, and banks are increasingly viewing money services businesses, as a class, to be higher risk customers for money laundering. as a result, our banking partners may limit the scope of services they provide to us or may impose additional requirements on us. these regulatory restrictions on banks and changes to banks' internal risk-based policies and procedures may result in a decrease in the number of banks that may do business with us, may require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business, may decrease our revenues and earnings and could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
failure to comply with privacy, data protection and cyber security laws and regulations could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations or financial condition, or have other adverse consequences the collection, storage, hosting, transfer, processing, disclosure, use, security and retention and destruction of personal information required to provide our services is subject to federal, state and foreign privacy, data protection and cyber security laws. these laws, which are not uniform, generally do one or more of the following: regulate the collection, storage, hosting, transfer (including in some cases, the transfer outside the country of collection), processing, disclosure, use, security and retention and destruction of personal information; require notice to individuals of privacy practices; give individuals certain access and correction rights with respect to their personal information; and regulate the use or disclosure of personal information for secondary purposes such as marketing. under certain circumstances, some of these laws require us to provide notification to affected individuals, clients, data protection authorities and/or other regulators in the event of a data breach. in many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information among the company and its subsidiaries. the european union (the "eu") general data protection regulation (the "gdpr"), which became effective in may 2018 and the california consumer protection act (the "ccpa"), which will become effective on january 1, 2020, are among the most comprehensive of these laws. as part of our overall data protection compliance program in connection with the gdpr, we implemented binding corporate rules ("bcrs") as both a data processor and data controller, which permits us to process and transfer personal data across borders in compliance with eu data protection laws. complying with these laws and requirements, including the enhanced obligations imposed by the gdpr, our bcrs and the ccpa, may result in significant costs to our business and require us to amend certain of our business practices. further, enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase. the future enactment of more restrictive laws, rules or regulations and/or future enforcement actions or investigations could have a materially adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on our businesses and noncompliance could result in significant regulatory penalties and legal liability and damage our reputation. in addition, data security events and concerns about privacy abuses by other companies are changing consumer and social expectations for enhanced privacy and data protection. as a result, even the perception of noncompliance, whether or not valid, may damage our reputation.
our businesses collect, host, store, transfer, process, disclose, use, secure and dispose of personal and business information, and collect, hold and transmit client funds, and a security or privacy breach may damage or disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation, increase our costs, cause losses and adversely affect our results of operations in connection with our business, we collect, host, store, transfer, process, disclose, use, secure and dispose of large amounts of personal and business information about our clients, employees of our clients, our vendors and our employees, contractors and temporary staff, including payroll information, health care information, personal and business financial data, social security numbers and their foreign equivalents, bank account numbers, tax information and other sensitive personal and business information. we also collect and transmit significant amounts of funds from the accounts of our clients to their employees, taxing authorities and others.
we are focused on ensuring that we safeguard and protect personal and business information and client funds, and we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update
14
our systems and processes. nonetheless, the global environment grows increasingly hostile as attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication, and we are regularly targeted by unauthorized parties using malicious tactics, code and viruses. certain of these malicious parties may be state-sponsored and supported by significant financial and technological resources. although this is a global problem, it may affect our businesses more than other businesses because malevolent parties (including our personnel) may focus on the amount and type of personal and business information that our businesses collect, host, store, transfer, process, disclose, use, secure and dispose of, and the client funds that we collect and transmit.
we have programs and processes in place to prevent, detect and respond to data or cyber security incidents. however, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, are increasingly more complex and sophisticated and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable or fail to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate or timely preventive or responsive measures. in addition, hardware, software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of data or our systems. unauthorized parties also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through fraud, trickery, or other methods of deceiving these third parties or our personnel, including phishing and other social engineering techniques whereby attackers use end-user behaviors to distribute computer viruses and malware into our systems. as these threats continue to evolve and increase, we may be required to invest significant additional resources to modify and enhance our information security and controls and to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities. in addition, while our operating environments are designed to safeguard and protect personal and business information, we do not have the ability to monitor the implementation or effectiveness of any safeguards by our clients, vendors or partners and, in any event, third parties may be able to circumvent those security measures. information obtained by malevolent parties resulting from successful attacks against our clients, vendors, partners or other third parties may, in turn, be used to attack our information technology systems.
any cyberattack, unauthorized intrusion, malicious software infiltration, network disruption, denial of service, corruption of data, theft of non-public or other sensitive information, or similar act by a malevolent party (including our personnel), or inadvertent acts or inactions by our vendors, partners or personnel, could result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential personal or business information or the theft of client funds, and could have a materially adverse effect on our business or results of operations or that of our clients, result in liability, litigation, regulatory investigations and sanctions or a loss of confidence in our ability to serve clients, or cause current or potential clients to choose another service provider. as the global environment grows increasingly hostile, the security of our operating environment is ever more important to our clients and potential clients. as a result, the breach or perceived breach of our security systems could result in a loss of confidence by our clients or potential clients and cause them to choose another service provider, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.
although we believe that we maintain a robust program of information security and controls and none of the data or cyber security incidents that we have encountered to date have materially impacted us, a data or cyber security incident could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation. while adp maintains insurance coverage that, subject to policy terms and conditions and a significant self-insured retention, is designed to address losses or claims that may arise in connection with certain aspects of data and cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of data and cyber risk.
our systems, applications, solutions and services may be subject to disruptions that could have a materially adverse effect on our business and reputation many of our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process, on a daily basis, a large number of complicated transactions. we rely heavily on our payroll, financial, accounting, and other data processing systems. we need to properly manage our systems, applications and solutions, and any upgrades, enhancements and expansions we may undertake from time to time, in order to ensure they properly support our businesses. if any of these systems, applications or solutions fails to operate properly or becomes disabled even for a brief period of time, whether due to malevolent acts, errors, defects or any other factor(s), we could suffer financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, loss of clients, regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition. we have disaster recovery, business continuity, and crisis management plans and procedures designed to protect our businesses against a multitude of events, including natural disasters, military or terrorist actions, power or communication failures, or similar events. despite our preparations, our plans and procedures may not be successful in preventing or mitigating the loss of client data, service interruptions, disruptions to our operations, or damage to our important facilities.
a disruption of our data centers could have a materially adverse effect on our business we host our applications and serve our clients from data centers that we operate and from data centers operated by third-party vendors. if any of our or our third-party vendors' data centers fails, becomes disabled or is disrupted, even for a limited period of time, our businesses could be disrupted
15
and we could suffer financial loss, liability to clients, loss of clients, regulatory intervention, or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition. in addition, our third-party vendors may cease providing data center facilities or services, elect to not renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, breach their agreements with us or fail to satisfy our expectations, which could disrupt our operations and require us to incur costs which could materially adversely affect our results of operation or financial condition.
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, it could materially adversely affect our business and our brand our ability to compete and our success depend, in part, upon our intellectual property. we rely on patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, customers, vendors, partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights. we may need to devote significant resources, including cybersecurity resources, to monitoring our intellectual property rights. in addition, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate or ineffective, or may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage. our intellectual property could be wrongfully acquired as a result of a cyber-attack or other wrongful conduct by third parties or our personnel. litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly and time-consuming. furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights, which may be successful.
we may be sued by third parties for infringement of their proprietary rights, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations there is considerable intellectual property development activity in our industry. third parties, including our competitors, may own or claim to own intellectual property relating to our products or services and may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights. we may be found to be infringing upon such rights, even if we are unaware of their intellectual property rights. any claims or litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses and, if successfully asserted against us or if we decide to settle, could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments, obtain licenses, modify applications, prevent us from offering our services, or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms. we may also be obligated to indemnify our customers, vendors or partners in connection with any such claim or litigation. even if we were to prevail in such a dispute, any litigation regarding our intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming.
if we fail to upgrade, enhance and expand our technology and services to meet client needs and preferences, the demand for our solutions and services may diminish our businesses operate in industries that are subject to rapid technological advances and changing client needs and preferences. in order to remain competitive and responsive to client demands, we continually upgrade, enhance, and expand our technology, solutions and services. if we fail to respond successfully to technology challenges and client needs and preferences, the demand for our solutions and services may diminish. in addition, investment in product development often involves a long return on investment cycle. we have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in product development. we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our development efforts before knowing to what extent our investments will result in products the market will accept. in addition, our business could be adversely affected in periods surrounding our new product introductions if customers delay purchasing decisions to evaluate the new product offerings. furthermore, we may not execute successfully on our product development strategy, including because of challenges with regard to product planning and timing and technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion.
we may not realize or sustain the expected benefits from our business transformation initiatives, and these efforts could have a materially adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, results of operations and competitive position we have been and will be undertaking certain transformation initiatives, which are designed to streamline our organization, extend our world-class distribution and strengthen our talent and culture, while supporting our revenue growth, margin improvement and productivity. if we do not successfully manage and execute these initiatives, or if they are inadequate or ineffective, we may fail to meet our financial goals and achieve anticipated benefits, improvements may be delayed, not sustained or not realized and our business, operations and competitive position could be adversely affected. these initiatives, or our failure to successfully manage them, could result in unintended consequences or unforeseen costs, including distraction of our management and employees, attrition, inability to attract or retain key personnel, and reduced employee productivity, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
political and economic factors may adversely affect our business and financial results trade, monetary and fiscal policies, and political and economic conditions may substantially change, and credit markets may experience periods of constriction and volatility. when there is a slowdown in the economy, employment levels and interest rates may decrease with a corresponding impact on our businesses. clients may react to worsening conditions by reducing their spending on hcm services or
16
renegotiating their contracts with us, which may adversely affect our business and financial results.
we invest our client funds in liquid, investment-grade marketable securities, money market securities, and other cash equivalents. nevertheless, our client fund assets are subject to general market, interest rate, credit, and liquidity risks. these risks may be exacerbated, individually or together, during periods of unusual financial market volatility. in addition, as part of our client funds investment strategy, we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for client funds and utilize short-term financing arrangements to satisfy our short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. in order to satisfy these short-term funding requirements, we maintain access to various sources of liquidity, including borrowings under our commercial paper program and our committed credit facilities, our ability to execute reverse repurchase transactions and corporate cash balances. a reduction in the availability of any such financing during periods of disruption in the financial markets or otherwise may require us to sell client fund assets to satisfy our short-term funding requirements, which may result in the recognition of losses and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.
we are dependent upon various large banks to execute electronic payments and wire transfers as part of our client payroll, tax and other money movement services. while we have contingency plans in place for bank failures, a systemic shutdown of the banking industry would impede our ability to process funds on behalf of our payroll, tax and other money movement services clients and could have an adverse impact on our financial results and liquidity.
we derive a significant portion of our revenues and operating income outside of the united states and, as a result, we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
our business could be negatively impacted as a result of actions by activist stockholders or others we may be subject to actions or proposals from activist stockholders or others that may not align with our business strategies or the interests of our other stockholders. responding to such actions could be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our business and operations, and divert the attention of our board of directors and senior management from the pursuit of our business strategies. activist stockholders may create perceived uncertainties as to the future direction of our business or strategy, which may be exploited by our competitors and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, potential customers and business partners and may affect our relationships with current customers, vendors, investors and other third parties. in addition, actions of activist stockholders may cause periods of fluctuation in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.
change in our credit ratings could adversely impact our operations and lower our profitability the major credit rating agencies periodically evaluate our creditworthiness and have given us very strong, investment-grade long-term debt ratings and the highest commercial paper ratings. failure to maintain high credit ratings on long-term and short-term debt could increase our cost of borrowing, reduce our ability to obtain intra-day borrowing required by our employer services business, and adversely impact our results of operations.
we may be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel our ability to grow and provide our clients with competitive services is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly motivated people with the skills to serve our clients. competition for skilled employees in the outsourcing and other markets in which we operate is intense and, if we are unable to attract and retain highly skilled and motivated personnel, results of our operations may suffer.

*see note 1 of the consolidated financial statements for a summary of adjustments.
(a) we include the interest income earned on investments associated with our client funds extended investment strategy and interest expense on borrowings related to our client funds extended investment strategy as we believe these amounts to be
27
fundamental to the underlying operations of our business model. the adjustments in the table above represent the interest income and interest expense that are not related to our client funds extended investment strategy and are labeled as "all other interest expense" and "all other interest income."
(b) the charges within transformation initiatives are comprised of charges related to our verp, service alignment initiative, workforce optimization and other transformation initiatives. charges related to our verp in fiscal 2019 include $48.2 million for non-cash pension settlement charges and special termination benefits, and $23.6 million of expenses related to the continuing health coverage, respectively. we also recorded severance charges in accordance with asc 712 totaling $33.6 million primarily relating to our workforce optimization initiative to reduce management layers and increase spans of controls and $56.8 million related to our other transformation initiatives during fiscal 2019. these charges were partially offset by net reversals of charges and gain on sale of assets related to our service alignment initiative totaling $23.9 million for fiscal 2019. unlike certain other severance charges in prior periods which are not included as an adjustment to get to adjusted results, these specific charges relate to actions that are part of our broad-based, company-wide transformation initiatives. refer to note 5 and 12 of the consolidated financial statements for a description of charges associated with service alignment initiative and verp.
(c) represents non-operational costs relating to proxy contest matters.
(d) the taxes on the gains on the sale of the businesses were calculated based on the annualized marginal rate in effect during the quarter of the adjustment. the tax amount was adjusted for a book vs. tax basis difference for the year ended june 30, 2017 due to the derecognition of goodwill upon the sale of the business.
(e) the tax benefit/provision on the transformation initiatives, gain on sale of asset, and non-operational charges related to proxy contest matters was calculated based on the annualized marginal rate in effect during the quarter of the adjustment.
(f) the net benefit for fiscal 2018 is comprised of the re-measurement of deferred tax balances resulting in a one-time benefit, primarily as a result of asc 606, using the lower tax rates enacted under the tax cuts and jobs act ("act"), adjustments to the one-time transition tax on the earnings and profits of our foreign subsidiaries, foreign withholding taxes, and a valuation allowance against our foreign tax credits which may not be realized under the act. refer to note 13 of our consolidated financial statements for additional detail.
(g) the adjusted effective tax rate is calculated as our adjusted provision for income taxes divided by our adjusted net earnings plus our adjusted provision for income taxes.
(h) "constant currency basis" provides information that isolates the actual growth of our operations. "constant currency basis" is determined by calculating the current year result using foreign exchange rates consistent with the prior year.
fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018
total revenues our revenues increased 6% in fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018. our revenue growth includes one percentage point of pressure from foreign currency partially offset by benefits from acquisitions. revenues in fiscal 2019 increased primarily due to new business started from employer services new business bookings and continued strong retention. refer to "analysis of reportable segments" for additional discussion of the increases in revenue for both of our reportable segments, employer services and professional employer organization ("peo") services.
total revenues in fiscal 2019 include interest on funds held for clients of $561.9 million, as compared to $466.5 million in fiscal 2018. the increase in the consolidated interest earned on funds held for clients resulted from the increase in our average interest rate earned to 2.2% in fiscal 2019, as compared to 1.9% in fiscal 2018, coupled with the increase in our average client funds balances of 4.6% to $25.5 billion in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018.
28
total expenses our total expenses increased 4% in fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018. the increase is primarily due to an increase in peo services zero-margin benefits pass-through costs, costs related to our acquisitions, increased selling and marketing expenses related to our brand efforts and the impact of net charges related to our transformation initiatives. the increase was partially offset by the impact of foreign currency, operating efficiencies as a result of our continued successful execution on our broader transformation initiatives, and costs related to proxy contest matters in fiscal 2018.
operating expenses increased 4% in fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018. peo services zero-margin benefits pass-through costs were $2,712.5 million for fiscal 2019 and $2,463.1 million for fiscal 2018. additionally, operating expenses increased due to costs related to our acquisitions partially offset by the impact of foreign currency and operating efficiencies as a result of our continued successful execution on our broader transformation initiatives.
systems development and programming costs were flat for fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, due to the impact of foreign currency translation and reduced costs as a result of our transformation initiatives offset by increased investments in product innovation, primarily in our next gen platforms.
selling, general and administrative expenses increased 4% in fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018.  the increase was primarily due to increased selling and marketing expenses related to our brand efforts and increased costs related to our transformation initiatives and acquisitions. these increases were partially offset by efficiencies as a result of our transformation initiatives, the impact of foreign currency translation in fiscal 2019 and costs related to proxy contest matters in fiscal 2018.

during fiscal 2019, we retrospectively adopted accounting standards update ("asu") 2017-07 and as a result we reclassified the non-service cost components of the net periodic benefit cost from within the respective line items of our statement of consolidated earnings to other (income)/expense, net. during fiscal 2019, non-service components of pension expense included $48.2 million of non-cash settlement charges and special termination benefits, partially offset by $54.9 million related to other components of net periodic pension cost. see note 1 and note 12 of our consolidated financial statements for additional details.
other (income)/expense, net, increased $283.2 million in fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018. the increase was primarily due to the charges within non-service components of pension expense in fiscal 2018 noted in the table above and the gain on sale of assets of $4.1 million in relation to the service alignment initiative and the gain on sale of investment of $15.7 million in relation to the sale of an investment held at cost acquired in prior years and subsequently sold in fiscal 2019. these are partially offset by the write down of $12.1 million related to internally developed software which was determined to have no future use due to redundant software identified as part of a recent acquisition in fiscal 2019.

provision for income taxes the effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 and 2018 was 23.7% and 17.4%, respectively. the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the one-time benefit recognized on the re-measurement of deferred tax balances, primarily as a result of asc 606, using the lower tax rates enacted under the act, the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions during fiscal 2018 and the loss of qualified production activities tax deductions as a result of the act during fiscal 2019. this is partially offset by reduction in the federal corporate statutory tax rate to 21% from our blended rate for fiscal 2018 of 28.1% as a result of the act. refer to note 13, income taxes, within the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
adjusted provision for income taxes the adjusted effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 and 2018 was 23.8% and 26.2%, respectively. the decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate is primarily due to the reduction in the federal corporate statutory tax rate to 21% from our blended rate for fiscal 2018 of 28.1%, partially offset by the loss of qualified production activities tax deductions as a result of the act in fiscal 2019, the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions and the benefit of a tax accounting method change filed with the irs in fiscal 2018.

peo services' overall margin increased from 14.0% to 14.6% for fiscal 2019, as compared to fiscal 2018, due to operating efficiencies partially offset by increases in selling expenses and changes in our estimated incurred losses related to adp indemnity in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018.
adp indemnity provides workers' compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for peo services' worksite employees up to $1 million per occurrence. peo services has secured a workers' compensation and employer's liability insurance policy that has a $1 million per occurrence retention and, in fiscal years 2012 and prior, aggregate stop loss insurance that covers any aggregate losses within the $1 million retention that collectively exceed a certain level, from an admitted and licensed insurance company of aig. the company has obtained approximately $242 million of irrevocable standby letters of credit in favor of licensed insurance companies of aig to secure totalsource workers' compensation obligations if adp were to fail to reimburse aig for workers' compensation payments. the company had no drawdowns during june 30, 2019 and 2018 under the letters of credit. we utilize historical loss experience and actuarial judgment to determine the estimated claim liability, and changes in estimated ultimate incurred losses are included in the peo segment.  adp indemnity recorded a pre-tax benefit of approximately $39 million in fiscal 2019, $40 million in fiscal 2018 and $20 million in fiscal 2017, which is primarily a result of changes in our estimated incurred losses. for the fiscal years 2013 to 2019, adp indemnity paid premiums to enter into reinsurance arrangements with ace american insurance company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of chubb limited, to cover substantially all losses incurred by adp indemnity during these policy years. each of these reinsurance arrangements limits our overall exposure incurred up to a certain limit. we believe the likelihood of ultimate losses exceeding this limit is remote. during fiscal 2019, adp indemnity paid a premium of $218.0 million to enter into a reinsurance arrangement with chubb limited to cover substantially all losses incurred by adp indemnity for the fiscal 2019 policy year to $1 million per occurrence related to the workers' compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for peo services' worksite employees. adp indemnity paid a premium of $215.0 million in july 2019 to enter into a reinsurance agreement with chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by adp indemnity for fiscal 2020 policy year on terms substantially similar to the fiscal 2019 reinsurance policy.

peo services' overall margin increased from 13.4% to 14.0% for fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017, due to reductions in selling expenses and changes in our estimated incurred losses related to adp indemnity in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, partially offset by pressure from growth in our zero-margin benefits pass-through revenues.
for impact of adp indemnity to peo services, refer to discussion above.
other the primary components of "other" are certain corporate overhead charges and expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments, including corporate functions, costs related to our transformation office, non-recurring gains and losses, the elimination of intercompany transactions, and other interest expense.

financial condition, liquidity and capital resources for corporate liquidity, we expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, long-term marketable securities, cash flow from operations together with our $10.3 billion of committed credit facilities and our ability to access both long-term and short-term debt financing from the capital markets will be adequate to meet our operating, investing, and financing activities such as regular quarterly dividends, share repurchases, and capital expenditures.
for client funds liquidity, we have the ability to borrow through our financing arrangements under our u.s. short-term commercial paper program and our u.s., canadian and united kingdom short-term reverse repurchase agreements, together with our $10.3 billion of committed credit facilities and our ability to use corporate liquidity when necessary to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. please see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a further discussion of the risks of our client funds investment strategy. see note 10 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our short-term financing including commercial paper.
as of june 30, 2019, cash and cash equivalents were $1.9 billion, which were primarily invested in time deposits and money market funds.

fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018
net cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 include cash payments for reinsurance agreements of $218.0 million and $235.0 million, respectively, which represent the policy premium for the entire fiscal year. the increase in operating cash provided is primarily due to growth in our business offset by a net decrease in the components of working capital as compared to fiscal 2018.
net cash flows from investing activities changed due to lower payments made related to acquisitions, the timing of proceeds offset by purchases of corporate and client funds marketable securities of $91.8 million, and reduced capital expenditures, partially offset by the payments made related to acquisitions of intangible assets in fiscal 2019.
net cash flows from financing activities changed primarily due to a net increase in the cash flow from client funds obligations of $1,355.6 million, which is due to the timing of impounds from our clients and payments to our clients' employees and other payees, more cash returned to shareholders via dividends in fiscal 2019, partially offset by an increase in net proceeds from reverse repurchase agreements and less cash paid for share repurchases.
we purchased approximately 6.5 million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $143.02 during fiscal 2019, as compared to purchases of 8.5 million shares at an average price per share of $116.07 during fiscal 2018. from time to time, the company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase program. the company
36
considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, actual and potential acquisition activity, cash balances and cash flows, issuances due to employee benefit plan activity, and market conditions.
fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017
net cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal 2018 increased primarily due to growth in our underlying business (net income adjusted for non-cash adjustments such as the verp in fiscal 2018 and the gain on the sale of cobra and chsa in fiscal 2017).
net cash flows from investing activities changed due to the timing of proceeds offset by purchases of corporate and client funds marketable securities of $632.6 million, payments made related to acquisitions in fiscal 2018 and proceeds from the sale of the chsa and cobra businesses of $234.0 million in fiscal 2017.
net cash flows from financing activities changed due to net increase in the cash flow from client funds obligations of $6,461.0 million, which is due to the timing of impounds from our clients and payments to our clients' employees and other payees and less cash paid for share repurchases.
we purchased approximately 8.5 million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $116.07 during fiscal 2018 as compared to purchases of 13.5 million shares at an average price per share of $94.42 during fiscal 2017. the increased cash flow from client fund obligations and reduced share repurchases were partially offset by cash returned to shareholders via dividends, which increased by $68.5 million from fiscal 2017.
capital resources and client fund obligations we have $2.0 billion of senior unsecured notes with maturity dates in 2020 and 2025. we may from time to time revisit the long-term debt market to refinance existing debt, finance investments including acquisitions for our growth, and maintain the appropriate capital structure. however, there can be no assurance that volatility in the global capital and credit markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us, or at all. see note 11 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our long-term financing.
our u.s. short-term funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained on an unsecured basis through the issuance of commercial paper, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. in june 2019, the company increased its u.s. short-term commercial paper program to provide for the issuance of up to $10.3 billion from $9.8 billion in aggregate maturity value. our commercial paper program is rated a-1+ by standard and poor's and prime-1 ("p-1") by moody's. these ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities. maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days. in fiscal 2019 and 2018, our average daily borrowings were $2.8 billion at a weighted average interest rate of 2.2% and 1.4%, respectively. the weighted average maturity of our commercial paper during fiscal 2019 and 2018 was approximately two days. at june 30, 2019 and 2018, we had no outstanding obligations under our short-term commercial paper program.
our u.s., canadian, and united kingdom short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements, which are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. these agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days.  we have successfully borrowed through the use of reverse repurchase agreements on an as needed basis to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. at june 30, 2019, the company had $262.0 million of outstanding obligations related to the reverse repurchase agreements. all outstanding reverse repurchase obligations matured and were fully paid in early july 2019. at june 30, 2018, there were no outstanding obligations related to the reverse repurchase agreements. for fiscal 2019 and 2018, we had average outstanding balances under reverse repurchase agreements of $316.7 million and $374.4 million, respectively, at weighted average interest rates of 1.9% and 1.3%, respectively. see the consolidated balance sheets of our consolidated financial statements for client fund investments used as collateral for reverse repurchase agreements.
we vary the maturities of our committed credit facilities to limit the refinancing risk of any one facility. we have a $3.8 billion, 364-day credit agreement that matures in june 2020 with a one year term-out option. in addition, we have a five-year $3.75 billion credit facility and a five-year $2.75 billion credit facility maturing in june 2023 and june 2024, respectively, each with an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500 million, subject to the availability of additional commitments. the primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and
37
funding for general corporate purposes, if necessary.  we had no borrowings through june 30, 2019 under the credit facilities. we believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the revolving credit agreements to borrow thereunder, and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the $10.3 billion available to us under the revolving credit agreements. see note 10 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our short-term financing including credit facilities.
our investment portfolio does not contain any asset-backed securities with underlying collateral of sub-prime mortgages, alternative-a mortgages, sub-prime auto loans or sub-prime home equity loans, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, credit default swaps, derivatives, auction rate securities, structured investment vehicles or non-investment grade fixed-income securities. we own aaa rated senior tranches of fixed rate auto loan, credit card, equipment lease, and rate reduction receivables, secured predominantly by prime collateral.  all collateral on asset-backed securities is performing as expected.  in addition, we own senior debt directly issued by federal home loan banks and federal farm credit banks.  our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio).  this investment strategy is supported by our short-term financing arrangements necessary to satisfy short-term funding requirements relating to client funds obligations. see note 7 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of our corporate investments and funds held for clients.
capital expenditures for fiscal 2019 were $162.7 million, as compared to $191.9 million for fiscal 2018. we expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2020 to be about $175 million.

total                                                                              $618.1                 $1,480.2              $244.7                 $1,366.0              $153.6                 $3,862.6
(1)   these amounts represent the principal and interest payments of our debt.
(2)   included in these amounts are various facilities and equipment leases. we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business relating to facilities and equipment. the majority of our lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. certain facility and equipment leases require payment of maintenance and real estate taxes and contain escalation provisions based on future adjustments in price indices. our future operating lease obligations could change if we exit certain contracts or if we enter into additional operating lease agreements.
(3)   purchase obligations are comprised of a $215.0 million reinsurance premium with chubb for the fiscal 2020 policy year, as well as obligations related to software subscription licenses and purchase and maintenance agreements on our software, equipment, and other assets.
(4)   based on current estimates, we expect to make cash payments up to $9.6 million in the next twelve months for obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits across various jurisdictions and tax periods. for $44.6 million of obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates as to the period in which cash payments are expected to be paid.
(5)   compensation and benefits primarily relates to amounts associated with our employee benefit plans and other compensation arrangements. these amounts exclude the estimated contributions to our defined benefit plans, which are expected to be $9.3 million in fiscal 2020.
in addition to the obligations quantified in the table above, we had obligations for the remittance of funds relating to our payroll and payroll tax filing services. as of june 30, 2019, the obligations relating to these matters, which are expected to be paid in fiscal 2020, total $29,144.5 million and were recorded in client funds obligations on our consolidated balance sheets. we had
38
$29,434.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities that were impounded from our clients to satisfy such obligations recorded in funds held for clients on our consolidated balance sheets as of june 30, 2019.
separately, adp indemnity paid a premium of $215.0 million in july 2019 to enter into a reinsurance agreement with chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by adp indemnity for the fiscal 2020 policy year. at june 30, 2019, adp indemnity had total assets of $575.8 million to satisfy the actuarially estimated unpaid losses of $448.1 million for the policy years since july 1, 2003. adp indemnity paid claims of $4.0 million and $4.6 million, net of insurance recoveries, in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. refer to the "analysis of reportable segments - peo services" above for additional information regarding adp indemnity.
in the normal course of business, we also enter into contracts in which we make representations and warranties that relate to the performance of our services and products. we do not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties.
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments (cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term marketable securities) and client funds assets (funds that have been collected from clients but not yet remitted to the applicable tax authorities or client employees).
our corporate investments are invested in cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities.  these assets are available for repurchases of common stock for treasury and/or acquisitions, as well as other corporate operating purposes.  all of our short-term and long-term fixed-income securities are classified as available-for-sale securities.
our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary objectives. consistent with those objectives, we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income. client funds assets are invested in highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities, with a maximum maturity of 10 years at the time of purchase, and money market securities and other cash equivalents.
we utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ short-term financing arrangements to satisfy our short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio). as part of our client funds investment strategy, we use the daily collection of funds from our clients to satisfy other unrelated client funds obligations, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. we minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available at the time such client's obligation becomes due by impounding, in virtually all instances, the client's funds in advance of the timing of payment of such client's obligation. as a result of this practice, we have consistently maintained the required level of client funds assets to satisfy all of our obligations.
there are inherent risks and uncertainties involving our investment strategy relating to our client funds assets. such risks include liquidity risk, including the risk associated with our ability to liquidate, if necessary, our available-for-sale securities in a timely manner in order to satisfy our client funds obligations. however, our investments are made with the safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client funds obligations. we also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity, including our corporate cash balances, available borrowings under our $10.3 billion commercial paper program (rated a-1+ by standard and poor's and p-1 by moody's, the highest possible short-term credit ratings), our ability to engage in reverse repurchase transactions and available borrowings under our $10.3 billion committed credit facilities. the reduced availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil, even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings, may limit our ability to access short-term debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business. in addition to liquidity risk, our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk, as discussed below.
we have established credit quality, maturity, and exposure limits for our investments. the minimum allowed credit rating for corporate, canadian government agency and canadian provincial bonds is bbb, for asset-backed securities is aaa, and for municipal bonds is a. the maximum maturity at time of purchase for bbb-rated securities is 5 years, for single a rated securities is 7 years, and for aa-rated and aaa-rated securities is 10 years. time deposits and commercial paper must be rated a-1 and/or p-1. money market funds must be rated aaa/aaa-mf.

we are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature, as the proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested. factors that influence the earnings impact of interest rate changes include, among others, the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between short-term and long-term investments.  this mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rate changes. the annualized interest rate earned on our entire portfolio increased from 1.9% for fiscal 2018 to 2.2% for fiscal 2019. a hypothetical change in both short-term interest rates (e.g., overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate) and intermediate-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately a $13 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending june 30, 2020.  a hypothetical change in only short-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average short-term investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately a $5 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending june 30, 2020.
we are exposed to credit risk in connection with our available-for-sale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities.  we limit credit risk by investing in investment-grade securities, primarily aaa and aa- rated securities, as rated by moody's, standard & poor's, dbrs for canadian dollar denominated securities, and fitch for asset-backed and commercial-mortgage-backed securities. approximately 79% of our available-for-sale securities held a aaa or aa rating at june 30, 2019. in addition, we limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than u.s. government and government agency, canadian government and united kingdom gilt securities.
we operate and transact business in various foreign jurisdictions and are therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. we may use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes. we had no derivative financial instruments outstanding at june 30, 2019 or 2018.

critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and other comprehensive income. we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. the estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are revenue recognition (including deferred costs), goodwill and income taxes. refer to note 1, summary of significant accounting policies, of notes to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of our policies.

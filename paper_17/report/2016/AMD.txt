item 1a. risk factors the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. if any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. in addition, you should consider the interrelationship and compounding effects of two or more risks occurring simultaneously.
intel corporation's dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit our ability to compete effectively.
intel corporation has been the market share leader for microprocessors for many years. intel's market share, margins and significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to influence customers who do business with us. these aggressive activities have in the past and are likely in the future to result in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for many of our products and adversely affect our margins and profitability.
intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and other marketing programs. as a result of intel's position in the microprocessor market, intel has been able to control x86 microprocessor and computer system standards and benchmarks and to dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of us. intel also dominates the computer system platform, which includes core logic chipsets, graphics chips, motherboards and other components necessary to assemble a computer system. oems that purchase microprocessors for computer systems are highly dependent on intel, less innovative on their own and, to a large extent, are distributors of intel technology. additionally, intel is able to drive de facto standards and specifications for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards.
as long as intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially adversely affected by intel's:
•   business practices, including rebating and allocation strategies and pricing actions, designed to limit our market share and margins;
•   product mix and introduction schedules;
•   product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies;
•   exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers and channel partners;
•   de facto control over industry standards, and heavy influence on pc manufacturers and other pc industry participants, including motherboard, memory, chipset and basic input/output system, or bios, suppliers and software companies as well as the graphics interface for intel platforms; and
•   marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the intel brand over the brand of its original equipment manufacturer oem customers.
intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on marketing and research and development than we do. we expect intel to maintain its market position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. to the extent intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to intel's aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products. for example, intel has introduced microprocessors for low-cost notebooks, similar to products that we offer for low-cost notebooks.
intel could also take actions that place our discrete gpus at a competitive disadvantage, including giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics market, such as nvidia corporation, preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information. intel's position in the microprocessor market and integrated graphics chipset market, its introduction of competitive new products, its existing relationships with top-tier oems and its aggressive marketing and pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us.
we have a wafer supply agreement with gf with obligations to purchase all of our microprocessor and apu product requirements, and a certain portion of our gpu product requirements from gf, with limited exceptions. if gf is not able to satisfy our manufacturing requirements, our business could be adversely impacted.
the wsa governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by gf. the wsa is in place until 2024. pursuant to the wsa, we are required to purchase all of our microprocessor and apu product requirements, and a portion of our gpu product requirements from gf with limited exceptions. if gf is unable to achieve anticipated manufacturing yields, remain
13
competitive using or implementing advanced leading-edge process technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our products, manufacture our products on a timely basis at competitive prices or meet our capacity requirements, then we may experience delays in product launches, supply shortages for certain products or increased costs and our business could be materially adversely affected. moreover, if gf is unable to satisfy our manufacturing requirements and we are unable to secure from gf additional exceptions allowing us to contract with another wafer foundry to satisfy those requirements, then our business could be materially adversely affected.
in august 2016, we entered into the sixth amendment to the wsa (sixth amendment) pursuant to which we agreed to certain annual wafer purchase targets through 2020, and if we fail to meet the agreed wafer purchase target during a calendar year we will be required to pay to gf a portion of the difference between our actual wafer purchases and the applicable annual purchase target. if our actual wafer requirements are less than the number of wafers required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target, we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit costs, both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and our results of operations.
in addition, gf has relied on mubadala technology investments llc (mubadala tech) for its funding needs. if mubadala tech fails to adequately fund gf on a timely basis, or at all, gf's ability to manufacture products for us could be materially adversely affected.
we rely on third parties to manufacture our products, and if they are unable to do so on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies, our business could be materially adversely affected.
we rely on third-party wafer foundries to fabricate the silicon wafers for all of our products. we also rely on third-party manufacturers to assemble, test, mark and pack (atmp) our products. it is important to have reliable relationships with all of these third-party manufacturing suppliers to ensure adequate product supply to respond to customer demand.
we cannot guarantee that these manufacturers or our other third-party manufacturing suppliers will be able to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements. if we experience supply constraints from our third-party manufacturing suppliers, we may be required to allocate the affected products amongst our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with these customers and on our financial condition. in addition, if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from our manufacturing suppliers, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business.
we do not have long-term commitment contracts with some of our third-party manufacturing suppliers. we obtain some of these manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantities in an existing purchase order. accordingly, we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices. the manufacturers we use also fabricate wafers and assemble, test and package products for other companies, including certain of our competitors. they could choose to prioritize capacity for other customers, increase the prices that they charge us on short notice or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
other risks associated with our dependence on third-party manufacturers include limited control over delivery schedules and quality assurance, lack of capacity in periods of excess demand, misappropriation of our intellectual property, dependence on several small undercapitalized subcontractors and limited ability to manage inventory and parts. moreover, if any of our third-party manufacturers suffer any damage to facilities, lose benefits under material agreements, experience power outages, lack sufficient capacity to manufacture our products, encounter financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers or suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions. if we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supplies of products, our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business.
if we transition the production of some of our products to new manufacturers, we may experience delayed product introductions, lower yields or poorer performance of our products. if we experience problems with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from a particular third-party manufacturer, or if we for other reasons cease utilizing one of those suppliers, we may be unable to secure an alternative supply for any specific product in a short time frame. we could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third-party manufacturers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
in april 2016, we consummated a transaction with tongfu fujitsu microelectronics co., ltd. (formerly, nantong fujitsu microelectronics co., ltd.) (tfme), under which we sold to tfme 85% of the equity interests in our atmp facilities consisting
14
of suzhou tf-amd semiconductor co., ltd. (formerly amd technologies (china) co., ltd.) and tf-amd microelectronics (penang) sdn. bhd. (formerly advanced micro devices export sdn. bhd.) thereby forming two joint ventures (collectively, the jvs). the majority of our atmp services will be provided by the jvs and there is no guarantee that the jvs will be able to adequately fulfill our atmp requirements as we continue to transition operations to the jvs, nor is there any guarantee that the jvs will be able to fulfill our long-term atmp requirements. if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the jvs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business.
failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for our products could negatively impact our financial results.
semiconductor manufacturing yields are a result of both product design and process technology, which is typically proprietary to the manufacturer, and low yields can result from design failures, process technology failures or a combination of both. our third-party foundries, including gf, are responsible for the process technologies used to fabricate silicon wafers. if our third-party foundries experience manufacturing inefficiencies or encounter disruptions, errors or difficulties during production, we may fail to achieve acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays. we cannot be certain that our third-party foundries will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement leading-edge process technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our products profitably or on a timely basis or that our competitors will not develop new technologies, products or processes earlier. moreover, during periods when foundries are implementing new process technologies, their manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive. a substantial delay in the technology transitions to smaller process technologies could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly if our competitors transition to more cost effective technologies before us. any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in per unit costs, which would adversely impact our gross margin and/or force us to allocate our reduced product supply amongst our customers, which could harm our relationships and reputation with our customers and materially adversely affect our business.
the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to introduce products on a timely basis with features and performance levels that provide value to our customers while supporting and coinciding with significant industry transitions.
our success depends to a significant extent on the development, qualification, implementation and acceptance of new product designs and improvements that provide value to our customers. our ability to develop, qualify and distribute, and have manufactured, new products and related technologies to meet evolving industry requirements, at prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target markets. for example, a large portion of our computing and graphics revenue is focused on consumer desktop pc and notebook. while overall growth in computing and graphics is stabilizing, the areas within computing and graphics are changing. our ability to take advantage of the opportunities within the areas of computing and graphics is based on foreseeing those changes and making timely investments in the form factors that serve those areas. as consumers adopt new form factors, have new product feature preferences or have different requirements than those consumers in the pc market, pc sales could be negatively impacted, which could adversely impact our business. our product roadmap includes a new x86 processor core codenamed "zen" to help drive our re-entry into high-performance and server computing. we cannot assure you that our efforts to execute our product roadmap and address markets beyond our core pc market will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers. if we fail to or are delayed in developing, qualifying or shipping new products or technologies that provide value to our customers and address these new trends or if we fail to predict which new form factors consumers will adopt and adjust our business accordingly, we may lose competitive positioning, which could cause us to lose market share and require us to discount the selling prices of our products. although we make substantial investments in research and development, we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement new products and technologies on a timely basis or that they will be well-received by our customers. moreover, our investments in new products and technologies involve certain risks and uncertainties and could disrupt our ongoing business. new investments may not generate sufficient revenue, may incur unanticipated liabilities and may divert our limited resources and distract management from our current operations. we cannot be certain that our ongoing investments in new products and technologies will be successful, will meet our expectations and will not adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results.
delays in developing, qualifying or shipping new products can also cause us to miss our customers' product design windows or, in some cases, breach contractual obligations or cause us to pay penalties. if our customers do not include our products in the initial design of their computer systems or products, they will typically not use our products in their systems or products until at least the next design configuration. the process of being qualified for inclusion in a customer's system or product can be lengthy and could cause us to further miss a cycle in the demand of end-users, which also could result in a loss of market share and harm our business. in addition, market demand requires that products incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry-wide basis. over the life of a specific product, the sale price is typically reduced over time. the introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products is necessary to maintain the overall corporate average selling price. if we are unable to introduce new products with sufficiently high sale prices or to increase unit sales volumes capable of offsetting the reductions in the sale prices of existing products over time, our business could be materially adversely affected.
15
if we cannot generate sufficient revenue and operating cash flow or obtain external financing, we may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of our planned investments in research and development or other strategic investments.
our ability to fund research and development expenditures depends on generating sufficient revenue and cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing, if necessary. our research and development expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances. if new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase. if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue, our operating results could decline.
we regularly assess markets for external financing opportunities, including debt and equity financing. additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms. the health of the credit markets may adversely impact our ability to obtain financing when needed. any downgrades from credit rating agencies such as moody's or standard & poor's may adversely impact our ability to obtain external financing or the terms of such financing. credit agency downgrades or concerns regarding our credit worthiness may impact relationships with our suppliers, who may limit our credit lines. our inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail planned investments in research and development or other strategic initiatives. if we curtail planned investments in research and development or abandon projects, our products may fail to remain competitive and our business would be materially adversely affected.
the loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on us.
collectively, sony corporation, microsoft corporation and hp inc. accounted for approximately 59% of our consolidated net revenue for the year ended december 31, 2016. sales to sony and microsoft consisted of products from our enterprise, embedded and semi-custom segment and sales to hp inc. consisted primarily of products from our computing and graphics segment. we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of revenue of our businesses in the future. if one of our key customers decides to stop buying our products, or if one of these customers materially reduces or reorganizes its operations or its demand for our products, our business would be materially adversely affected.
our receipt of revenue from our semi-custom soc products is dependent upon our technology being designed into third-party products and the success of those products.
the revenue that we receive from our semi-custom soc products is in the form of non-recurring engineering fees charged to third parties for design and development services and revenue received in connection with sales of our semi-custom soc products to these third parties. as a result, our ability to generate revenue from our semi-custom products depends on our ability to secure customers for our semi-custom design pipeline, our customers' desire to pursue the project, and our semi-custom soc products being incorporated into those customer's products. any revenue from sales of our semi-custom soc products is directly related to sales of the third-party's products and reflective of their success in the market. moreover, we have no control over the marketing efforts of these third parties, and we cannot make any assurances that sales of their products will be successful in current or future years. consequently, the semi-custom soc product revenue expected by us may not be fully realized and our operating results may be adversely affected.
global economic uncertainty may adversely impact our business and operating results.
uncertain global economic conditions have in the past and may in the future adversely impact our business, including, without limitation, a slowdown in the chinese economy, one of the largest global markets for desktop and notebook pcs. uncertainty in the worldwide economic environment may negatively impact consumer confidence and spending causing our customers to postpone purchases. in addition, during challenging economic times, our current or potential future customers may experience cash flow problems and as a result may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products. additionally, if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are unable to secure financing, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that they owe us. the risk related to our customers' potentially defaulting on or delaying payments to us is increased because we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of our revenue. any inability of our current or potential future customers to pay us for our products may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow. moreover, our key suppliers may reduce their output or become insolvent, thereby adversely impacting our ability to manufacture our products. in addition, uncertain economic conditions may make it more difficult for us to raise funds through borrowings or private or public sales of debt or equity securities.
16
the markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive.
the markets in which our products are sold are very competitive and delivering the latest and best products to market on a timely basis is critical to achieving revenue growth. we believe that the main factors that determine our product competitiveness are timely product introductions, product quality, product features and capabilities (including enabling state-of-the-art visual and virtual reality experience), energy efficiency (including power consumption and battery life), reliability, processor clock speed, performance, size (or form factor), selling price, cost, adherence to industry standards (and the creation of open industry standards), level of integration, software and hardware compatibility, security and stability, brand recognition and availability.
we expect that competition will continue to be intense due to rapid technological changes, frequent product introductions by our competitors or new competitors of products that may provide better performance/experience or may include additional features that render our products uncompetitive. we may also face aggressive pricing by competitors, especially during challenging economic times. some competitors may have greater access or rights to complementary technologies, including interface, processor and memory technical information. for instance, with the introduction of our apu products and other competing solutions with integrated graphics, we believe that demand for additional discrete graphics chips and cards may decrease in the future due to improvements in the quality and performance of integrated graphics. in addition, our competitors have significant marketing and sales resources which could increase the competitive environment in such a declining market, leading to lower prices and margins. if competitors introduce competitive new products into the market before us, demand for our products could be adversely impacted and our business could be adversely affected.
in addition, we are entering markets with current and new competitors who may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirements and emerging technologies. we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitors who may have stronger positions in these new markets or superior ability to anticipate customer requirements and emerging industry trends. we may face delays or disruptions in research and development efforts, or we may be required to invest significantly greater resources in research and development than anticipated.
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligations or meet our working capital requirements.
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt will depend on our financial and operating performance, which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate cash flow or that we will be able to borrow funds, including under our secured revolving line of credit for a principal amount up to $500 million (our secured revolving line of credit), in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our debt or to meet our working capital requirements. if we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds to service our debt, we may be required to sell assets or equity, reduce expenditures, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing. we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our debt, sell assets or equity, borrow funds under our secured revolving line of credit or borrow more funds on terms acceptable to us, if at all.
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations.
our total debt as of december 31, 2016 was $1.4 billion, net of unamortized debt issuance costs and unamortized debt discount associated with the 2.125% notes. our substantial indebtedness may:
•   make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments;
•   limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes;
•   limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes;
•   require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments;
•   place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with relatively less debt; and
•   increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.
we enter into interest rate swap agreements from time to time to manage our exposure to interest rate risk. these swap agreements involve risks, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, the risk that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates and the risk that our exposure to interest rates may increase if interest rates increase.
17
we also enter into sale and factoring arrangements from time to time with respect to certain of our accounts receivables, which arrangements are non-recourse to us in the event that an account debtor fails to pay for credit-related reasons, and are not included in our indebtedness. we could become obligated to repurchase such accounts receivables or otherwise incur liability to the counterparties under these arrangements under certain circumstances, such as where a commercial dispute arises between us and an account debtor.
the agreements governing our notes and our secured revolving line of credit impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business.
the indentures governing our 6.75% senior notes due 2019 (6.75% notes), 7.50% senior notes due 2022 (7.50% notes), 7.00% senior notes due 2024 (7.00% notes) and 2.125% notes contain various covenants which limit our ability to, among other things:
•   incur additional indebtedness;
•   pay dividends and make other restricted payments;
•   make certain investments, including investments in our unrestricted subsidiaries;
•   create or permit certain liens;
•   create or permit restrictions on the ability of certain restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us;
•   use the proceeds from sales of assets;
•   enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates; and
•   consolidate or merge or sell our assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety.
in addition, the amended and restated loan agreement restricts our ability to make cash payments on the notes to the extent that, on the date of such payment, a default or event of default exists under the amended and restated loan agreement, or we have not had at all times during the 45 consecutive days immediately preceding such payment, or would not have, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such payment, excess cash availability (as defined in the amended and restated loan agreement) of at least $100 million. any of our future debt agreements may contain similar restrictions. if we fail to make any cash payment on a series of notes when required by the applicable indenture, it would constitute an event of default under such indenture, which, in turn, would constitute an event of default under the agreements governing our other indebtedness.
our secured revolving line of credit also contains various covenants which limit our ability to, among other things, make certain investments, merge or consolidate with other entities and permit certain subsidiaries from incurring indebtedness. in addition, further restrictions apply when certain payment conditions (the payment conditions) are not satisfied with respect to specified transactions, events or payments. the payment conditions include that (i) no default or event of default exists and (ii) at all times during the 45 consecutive days immediately prior to such transaction, event or payment and on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such transaction, event or payment and any incurrence or repayment of indebtedness in connection therewith, the loan parties' excess cash availability (as defined in the amended and restated loan agreement) available cash is greater than the greater of 20% of the total commitment amount and $100 million. if payment conditions are not satisfied under certain circumstances, we will become subject to various additional covenants which limit our ability to, among other things:
•   create liens upon any of the loan parties' property (other than customary permitted liens and liens in respect of up to $1.5 billion of secured credit facilities debt (which amount includes our secured revolving line of credit));
•   declare or make cash distributions;
•   create any encumbrance on the ability of a subsidiary to make any upstream payments;
•   make asset dispositions other than certain ordinary course dispositions and certain supply chain finance arrangements;
•   make certain loans, make payments with respect to subordinated debt or certain borrowed money prior to its due date; and
•   enter into any non-arm's-length transaction with an affiliate (except for certain customary exceptions).
the agreements governing our notes and our secured revolving line of credit contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross defaults under agreements covering other borrowings. for example, the occurrence of a default with respect to any indebtedness or any failure to repay debt when due in an amount in excess of $50 million would cause a cross default under the indentures (to the extent such default would result in the acceleration of such indebtedness) governing our 6.75% notes, 7.50% notes, 7.00% notes and 2.125% notes, as well as under our secured revolving line of credit. the occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable note holders or the lenders under our secured revolving line of credit to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable. if the note holders or the trustee under the indentures governing our 6.75% notes, 7.50%
18
notes, 7.00% notes or 2.125% notes or the lenders under our secured revolving line of credit accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings.
uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us.
we typically sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders. we generally do not have long-term supply arrangements with our customers or minimum purchase requirements except that orders generally must be for standard pack quantities. generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. we base our inventory levels in part on customers' estimates of demand for their products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when our products are sold indirectly through downstream channel distributors and customers, as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties throughout the downstream channel.
pc and consumer markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. in addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. we may build inventories during periods of anticipated growth, and the cancellation or deferral of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize, could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins.
factors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of the value of our inventory, a reduction in the average selling price or a reduction in our gross margin include:
•   a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products;
•   a production or design defect in our products;
•   a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements;
•   a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or
•   our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressive pricing actions.
the demand for our products depends in part on the market conditions in the industries into which they are sold. fluctuations in demand for our products or a market decline in any of these industries could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
industry-wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future. a large portion of our computing and graphics revenue is focused on the consumer desktop pc and notebook segments, which have experienced and continue to experience a decline driven by, among other factors, the adoption of smaller and other form factors, increased competition and changes in replacement cycles. the success of our semi-custom soc products is dependent on securing customers for our semi-custom design pipeline and consumer market conditions, including the success of the new sony playstation®4 and microsoft xbox one game console systems worldwide.
our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property.
in the design and development of new and enhanced products, we rely on third-party intellectual property such as software development tools and hardware testing tools. furthermore, certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties. the design requirements necessary to meet customer demand for more features and greater functionality from semiconductor products may exceed the capabilities of the third-party intellectual property or development tools available to us. if the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable, is not available with required functionality and performance in the time frame or price point needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meet customer demands, our business could be materially adversely affected.
we depend on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, software and other computer platform components to support our business.
we depend on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, software (e.g. bios, operating systems) and other components that our customers utilize to support our microprocessor, gpu and apu offerings. we also rely on aibs to support our gpu and apu products. in addition, our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with intel microprocessors. if the designers, manufacturers, aibs and suppliers of motherboards,
19
software and other components decrease their support for our product offerings, our business could be materially adversely affected.
if we lose microsoft corporation's support for our products or other software vendors do not design and develop software to run on our products, our ability to sell our products could be materially adversely affected.
our ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by intel depends partially on microsoft designing and developing its operating systems to run on or support our x86-based microprocessor products. with respect to our graphics products, we depend in part on microsoft to design and develop its operating system to run on or support our graphics products. similarly, the success of our products in the market, such as our apu products, is dependent on independent software providers designing and developing software to run on our products. if microsoft does not continue to design and develop its operating systems so that they work with our x86 instruction sets or does not continue to develop and maintain their operating systems to support our graphics products, independent software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase pcs with our products. in addition, some software drivers sold with our products are certified by microsoft. if microsoft did not certify a driver, or if we otherwise fail to retain the support of microsoft or other software vendors, our ability to market our products would be materially adversely affected.
our reliance on third-party distributors and aib partners subjects us to certain risks.
we market and sell our products directly and through third-party distributors and aib partners pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party. these agreements are non-exclusive and permit both our distributors and aibs to offer our competitors' products. we are dependent on our distributors and aibs to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts. if any significant distributor or aib or a substantial number of our distributors or aibs terminated their relationship with us, decided to market our competitors' products over our products or decided not to market our products at all, our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected. if we are unable to manage the risks related to the use of our third-party distributors and aib partners or offer appropriate incentives to focus them on the sale of our products, our business could be materially adversely affected.
additionally, distributors and aibs typically maintain an inventory of our products. in most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions, as well as provide return rights for any product that we have removed from our price book and that is not more than 12 months older than the manufacturing code date. some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. our agreements with aibs protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. we defer the gross margins on our sales to distributors and aibs, resulting from both our deferral of revenue and related product costs, until the applicable products are re-sold by the distributors or the aibs. however, in the event of a significant decline in the price of our products, the price protection rights we offer would materially adversely affect us because our revenue and corresponding gross margin would decline.
our inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel may hinder our business.
much of our future success depends upon the continued service of numerous qualified engineering, marketing, sales and executive personnel. competition for highly skilled employees and executives in the technology industry is intense. if we are not able to continue to attract, train and retain qualified personnel necessary for our business, the progress of our product development programs could be hindered, and we could be materially adversely affected. to help attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, we use share-based incentive awards such as employee stock options and non-vested share units (restricted stock units). if the value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock, or if our share-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, our ability to attract, retain and motivate personnel could be weakened, which could harm our results of operations. also, if the value of our stock awards increases substantially, this could potentially create great personal wealth for our employees and affect our ability to retain these employees. in addition, our current and any future restructuring plans may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain key employees.
our issuance to west coast hitech l.p. (wch) of warrants to purchase 75 million shares of our common stock, if and when exercised, will dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders, and the conversion of the 2.125% notes may dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders, or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.
in consideration for the limited waiver and rights under the sixth amendment, we issued warrants to wch to purchase 75 million shares of our common stock. any issuance by us of common shares to wch upon exercise of the warrants will dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders. any sales in the public market by wch of any shares owned by wch could
20
adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock, and the anticipated exercise by wch of the warrants could depress the price of our common stock.
also, the conversion of some or all of the 2.125% notes may dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders. such 2.125% notes may become convertible at the option of their holders prior to their scheduled term under certain circumstances.  any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. in addition, the existence of the 2.125% notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion thereof could be used to satisfy short positions, or the anticipated conversion of the 2.125% notes into cash and/or shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.
in the event of a change of control, we may not be able to repurchase our outstanding debt as required by the applicable indentures and our secured revolving line of credit, which would result in a default under the indentures and our secured revolving line of credit.
upon a change of control, we will be required to offer to repurchase all of our 6.75% notes, 7.50% notes, 7.00% notes and 2.125% notes then outstanding at 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the repurchase date. in addition, a change of control would be an event of default under our secured revolving line of credit. as of december 31, 2016, no borrowings were outstanding under the secured revolving line of credit, $19 million related to letters of credit under the secured revolving line of credit remained outstanding and $1.43 billion was outstanding under our notes. future debt agreements may contain similar provisions. we may not have the financial resources to repurchase our outstanding notes and prepay all of our outstanding obligations under our secured revolving line of credit.
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced severe downturns that have materially adversely affected, and may continue to materially adversely affect, our business in the future.
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced significant downturns, often in conjunction with constant and rapid technological change, wide fluctuations in supply and demand, continuous new product introductions, price erosion and declines in general economic conditions. we have incurred substantial losses in recent downturns, due to:
•   substantial declines in average selling prices;
•   the cyclical nature of supply and demand imbalances in the semiconductor industry;
•   a decline in demand for end-user products (such as pcs) that incorporate our products; and
•   excess inventory levels.
industry-wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future. for example, a large portion of our computing and graphics revenue is focused on consumer desktop pc and notebook segments. while the overall growth in these segments is stabilizing, the sub-segments of these markets are changing. our ability to take advantage of the growth in these sub-segments is based on foreseeing those changes and making timely investments in the form factors that serve those growing sub-segments.
global economic uncertainty and weakness have also impacted the semiconductor market as consumers and businesses have deferred purchases, which negatively impacted demand for our products. our financial performance has been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by these downturns.
the growth of our business is also dependent on continued demand for our products from high-growth adjacent emerging global markets. our ability to be successful in such markets depends in part on our ability to establish adequate local infrastructure, as well as our ability to cultivate and maintain local relationships in these markets. if demand from these markets is below our expectations, sales of our products may decrease, which would have a material adverse effect on us.
acquisitions, divestitures and/or joint ventures could disrupt our business, harm our financial condition and operating results or dilute, or adversely affect the price of, our common stock.
our success will depend, in part, on our ability to expand our product offerings and grow our business in response to changing technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures. in some circumstances, we may pursue growth through the acquisition of complementary businesses, solutions or technologies or through divestitures or joint ventures rather than through internal development. the identification of suitable acquisition or joint venture candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions or joint ventures. moreover, if such acquisitions or joint ventures require us to seek additional debt or equity financing, we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms favorable to us or at all. even if we successfully complete an acquisition or a joint venture, we may not be able to assimilate and
21
integrate effectively or efficiently the acquired business, technologies, solutions, assets, personnel or operations, particularly if key personnel of the acquired company decide not to work for us. acquisitions and joint ventures may also involve the entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience. consequently, we may not achieve anticipated benefits of the acquisitions or joint ventures which could harm our operating results. in addition, to complete an acquisition, we may issue equity securities, which would dilute our stockholders' ownership and could adversely affect the price of our common stock, as well as incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or have amortization expenses and write-downs of acquired assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations. acquisitions and joint ventures may also reduce our cash available for operations and other uses, which could harm our business. also, any failure on our part to effectively evaluate and execute new business initiatives could adversely affect our business. we may not adequately assess the risk of new business initiatives and subsequent events may arise that alter the risks that were initially considered.
furthermore, we may not achieve the objectives and expectations with respect to future operations, products and services. on april 2016, we consummated the transaction with tfme, under which we sold to tfme 85% of the equity interests in our jvs. going forward, we expect the majority of our atmp services will be provided by the jvs and there is no guarantee that the jvs will be able to adequately fulfill our atmp requirements as we continue to transition operations to tfme, nor is there any guarantee that the jvs will be able to fulfill our long-term atmp requirements. if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the jvs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business.
in addition, we may not realize the anticipated benefits from any new business initiatives. for example, in connection with our strategy of licensing portions of our intellectual property portfolio, in the first quarter of 2016, we entered into a joint venture with tianjin haiguang advanced technology investment co., ltd. (thatic), comprised of two separate legal entities, china jv1 and china jv2 (collectively, the thatic jv). the primary purpose of the thatic jv is to support our expansion into the server and workstation product market in china. we also licensed certain of our intellectual property (licensed ip) to the thatic jv for license fees payable over several years contingent upon achievement of certain milestones. we also expect to receive a royalty based on the sales of the thatic jv's products to be developed on the basis of such licensed ip. we may not realize the expected benefits from this joint venture, including the thatic jv's expected future performance, the receipt of any future milestone payments from the licensed ip, and the receipt of any royalty payments from future sales of products by the thatic jv.
our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls.
we rely upon a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key business functions, and the efficient operation of these processes and systems is critical to our business. our business processes and information systems need to be sufficiently scalable to support the growth of our business and may require modifications or upgrades that expose us to a number of operational risks. as such, our information systems will continually evolve and adapt in order to meet our business needs. these changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time.
these changes may also require changes in our information systems, modification of internal control procedures and significant training of employees and third-party resources. we continuously work on simplifying our information systems and applications through consolidation and standardization efforts. there can be no assurance that our business and operations will not experience any disruption in connection with this transition. our information technology systems, and those of third-party information technology providers or business partners, may also be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control including catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, viruses or malware, cyber-attacks, data breaches and computer system or network failures, exposing us to significant cost, reputational harm and disruption or damage to our business.
in addition, as our it environment continues to evolve, we are embracing new ways of communicating and sharing data internally and externally with customers and partners using methods such as mobility and the cloud that can promote business efficiency. however, these practices can also result in a more distributed it environment, making it more difficult for us to maintain visibility and control over internal and external users, and meet scalability and administrative requirements. if our security controls cannot keep pace with the speed of these changes, or if we are not able to meet regulatory and compliance requirements, our business would be materially adversely affected.
data breaches and cyber-attacks could compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information, be costly to remediate and cause significant damage to our business and reputation.
in the ordinary course of our business, we maintain sensitive data on our networks, including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information relating to our business and that of our customers and business partners. the
22
secure maintenance of this information is critical to our business and reputation. we believe that companies have been increasingly subject to a wide variety of security incidents, cyber-attacks, hacking and phishing attacks, and other attempts to gain unauthorized access. these threats can come from a variety of sources, all ranging in sophistication from an individual hacker to a state-sponsored attack. cyber threats may be generic, or they may be custom-crafted against our information systems. over the past year, cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and much harder to detect and defend against. our network and storage applications may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions. it is often difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage caused by such incidents. these data breaches and any unauthorized access or disclosure of our information or intellectual property could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information. cyber-attacks could also cause us to incur significant remediation costs, result in product development delays, disrupt key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources. these incidents could also subject us to liability, expose us to significant expense and cause significant harm to our reputation and business. in addition, we could be subject to potential claims for damages resulting from loss of data from alleged vulnerabilities in the security of our processors. we also maintain confidential and personally identifiable information about our workers. the integrity and protection of our worker data is critical to our business and our workers have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information. we anticipate an increase in costs related to:
•   implementing new data security procedures, including costs related to upgrading computer and network security;
•   training workers to maintain and monitor our security measures;
•   remediating any data security breach and addressing the related litigation; and
•   mitigating reputational harm.
we often partner with third-party providers for certain worker services and we may provide certain limited worker information to such third parties based on the scope of the services provided to us. however, if these third parties fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of their networks, our workers' data may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed. a breach of data privacy is likely to cause significant disruption of our business operations. failure to adequately maintain and update our security systems could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain worker confidence. failure to prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information and data breaches could materially adversely affect our financial condition, our competitive position and operating results.
our operating results are subject to quarterly and seasonal sales patterns.
a large portion of our quarterly sales have historically been made in the last month of the quarter. this uneven sales pattern makes prediction of revenue for each financial period difficult and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition. in addition, our operating results tend to vary seasonally with the markets in which our products are sold. for example, historically, first quarter pc product sales are generally lower than fourth quarter sales. in addition, with respect to our semi-custom soc products for game consoles, we expect sales patterns to follow the seasonal trends of a consumer business with sales in the first half of the year being lower than sales in the second half of the year. many of the factors that create and affect quarterly and seasonal trends are beyond our control.
if essential equipment, materials or manufacturing processes are not available to manufacture our products, we could be materially adversely affected.
we may purchase equipment and materials for our back-end manufacturing operations from a number of suppliers and our operations depend upon obtaining deliveries of adequate supplies of equipment and materials on a timely basis. our third-party suppliers also depend on the same timely delivery of adequate quantities of equipment and materials in the manufacture of our products. in addition, as many of our products increase in technical complexity, we rely on our third-party suppliers to update their processes in order to continue meeting our back-end manufacturing needs. certain equipment and materials that are used in the manufacture of our products are available only from a limited number of suppliers, or in some cases, a sole supplier. we also depend on a limited number of suppliers to provide the majority of certain types of integrated circuit packages for our microprocessors, including our apu products. similarly, certain non-proprietary materials or components such as memory, printed circuit boards (pcbs), interposers, substrates and capacitors used in the manufacture of our products are currently available from only a limited number of sources. because some of the equipment and materials that we and our third-party manufacturing suppliers purchase are complex, it is sometimes difficult to substitute one supplier for another.
from time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supply or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. also, some of these materials and components may be subject to rapid changes in price and availability. interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials. dependence on a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers exacerbates these risks. if we are unable to procure certain of these materials
23
for our back-end manufacturing operations, or our third-party foundries or manufacturing suppliers are unable to procure materials for manufacturing our products, our business would be materially adversely affected.
if our products are not compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware, we could be materially adversely affected.
our products may not be fully compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware. further, we may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility problems in a timely manner. if our customers are unable to achieve compatibility with software or hardware, we could be materially adversely affected. in addition, the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem relating to our products could have a material adverse effect on our business.
costs related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us.
products as complex as those we offer may contain defects or failures when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements to existing products are released. we cannot assure you that, despite our testing procedures, errors will not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments in the future, which could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products, material recall and replacement costs, delay in recognition or loss of revenue, writing down the inventory of defective products, the diversion of the attention of our engineering personnel from product development efforts, defending against litigation related to defective products or related property damage or personal injury and damage to our reputation in the industry and could adversely affect our relationships with our customers. in addition, we may have difficulty identifying the end customers of the defective products in the field. as a result, we could incur substantial costs to implement modifications to correct defects. any of these problems could materially adversely affect our business.
we could be subject to potential product liability claims if one of our products causes, or merely appears to have caused, an injury. claims may be made by consumers or others selling our products, and we may be subject to claims against us even if an alleged injury is due to the actions of others. a product liability claim, recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business.
if we fail to maintain the efficiency of our supply chain as we respond to changes in customer demand for our products, our business could be materially adversely affected.
our ability to meet customer demand for our products depends, in part, on our ability to deliver the products our customers want on a timely basis. accordingly, we rely on our supply chain for the manufacturing, distribution and fulfillment of our products. as we continue to grow our business, expand to high-growth adjacent markets, acquire new customers and strengthen relationships with existing customers, the efficiency of our supply chain will become increasingly important because many of our customers tend to have specific requirements for particular products, and specific time-frames in which they require delivery of these products. if we are unable to consistently deliver the right products to our customers on a timely basis in the right locations, our customers may reduce the quantities they order from us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
we outsource to third parties certain supply-chain logistics functions, including portions of our product distribution, transportation management and information technology support services.
we rely on third-party providers to operate our regional product distribution centers and to manage the transportation of our work-in-process and finished products among our facilities, to our manufacturing suppliers and to our customers. in addition, we rely on third parties to provide certain information technology services to us, including help desk support, desktop application services, business and software support applications, server and storage administration, data center operations, database administration and voice, video and remote access. we cannot guarantee that these providers will fulfill their respective responsibilities in a timely manner in accordance with the contract terms, in which case our internal operations and the distribution of our products to our customers could be materially adversely affected. also, we cannot guarantee that our contracts with these third-party providers will be renewed, in which case we would have to transition these functions in-house or secure new providers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business if the transition is not executed appropriately.
the completion and impact of the 2015 restructuring plan, our transformation initiatives and any future restructuring actions could adversely affect us.
in the third quarter of 2015, we implemented a restructuring plan (2015 restructuring plan) focused on our ongoing efforts to simplify our business and better align resources around our priorities and business outlook. the 2015 restructuring plan largely involved a reduction of global headcount by approximately 5% and includes organizational actions such as outsourcing certain it services and application development. we expect the 2015 restructuring plan will be completed by the end of the first quarter
24
of 2017. these restructuring actions and any future restructuring actions could have an adverse impact on our business as a result of decreases in employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees. we cannot be sure that we will realize operational savings or any other anticipated benefits from the 2015 restructuring plan or any future restructuring actions. any operating savings are subject to assumptions, estimates and significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. if these estimates and assumptions are incorrect, if we experience delays or if other unforeseen events occur, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.
any transformation initiatives or future restructuring actions we undertake may fail to achieve the anticipated results and may materially adversely affect our business and financial results.
we may incur future impairments of goodwill.
we perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year. subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis, we monitor for any events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management's business strategy, an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace, an inability to successfully achieve internal forecasts or significant declines in our stock price, which may represent an indicator of impairment. the occurrence of any of these events may require us to record future goodwill impairment charges.
our stock price is subject to volatility.
our stock price has experienced price and volume fluctuations and could be subject to wide fluctuations in the future. during 2016, the closing price of our stock price ranged from $1.80 to $12.07. the trading price of our stock may fluctuate widely due to various factors including, actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial conditions and operating results, changes in financial estimates by us or securities analysts, changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public, interest rate changes, and broad market and industry fluctuations. stock price fluctuations could impact the value of our equity compensation, which could affect our ability to recruit and retain employees. in addition, volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities.
our worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on us.
we maintain operations around the world, including in the united states, canada, europe and asia. we rely on third-party wafer foundries in europe and asia. nearly all product assembly and final testing of our products is performed at manufacturing facilities, operated by third-party manufacturing facilities, in china, malaysia and taiwan. we also have international sales operations. international sales, as a percent of net revenue, were 78% in 2016. we expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future.
the political, legal and economic risks associated with our operations in foreign countries include, without limitation:
•   expropriation;
•   changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions;
•   changes in tax laws, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;
•   difficulties in protecting our intellectual property;
•   difficulties in managing staffing and exposure to different employment practices and labor laws;
•   changes in foreign currency exchange rates;
•   restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions;
•   changes in freight and interest rates;
•   disruption in air transportation between the united states and our overseas facilities;
•   loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs; and
•   compliance with u.s. laws and regulations related to international operations, including export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations and the foreign corrupt practices act.
in addition, our worldwide operations (or those of our business partners) could be subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding, typhoons and volcanic eruptions that disrupt manufacturing or other operations. for example, our sunnyvale operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in california. any conflict or uncertainty in the countries in which we operate, including public health issues (for example, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as avian influenza, measles or ebola), safety issues, natural disasters, fire, disruptions of service from utilities, nuclear power plant accidents or general economic or political factors. for example, the united kingdom's recent referendum, commonly referred to as "brexit,"
25
has created economic and political uncertainty in the european union. also the new u.s. administration has called for changes to domestic and foreign policy. we cannot predict the impact, if any, of the policies adopted by the new administration will have on our business. until we know what changes are enacted, we will not know whether in total we benefit from, or are negatively affected by, the changes. any of the above risks, should they occur, could result in an increase in the cost of components, production delays, general business interruptions, delays from difficulties in obtaining export licenses for certain technology, tariffs and other barriers and restrictions, longer payment cycles, increased taxes, restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business.
worldwide political conditions may adversely affect demand for our products.
worldwide political conditions may create uncertainties that could adversely affect our business. the united states has been and may continue to be involved in armed conflicts that could have a further impact on our sales and our supply chain. the consequences of armed conflict, political instability or civil or military unrest are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us. terrorist attacks or other hostile acts may negatively affect our operations, or adversely affect demand for our products, and such attacks or related armed conflicts may impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. furthermore, these attacks or hostile acts may make travel and the transportation of our products more difficult and more expensive, which could materially adversely affect us. any of these events could cause consumer spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the united states economy and worldwide financial markets.
unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect us.
we have costs, assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies. as a consequence, movements in exchange rates could cause our foreign currency denominated expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue, affecting our profitability and cash flows. whenever we believe appropriate, we hedge a portion of our short-term foreign currency exposure to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates. we determine our total foreign currency exposure using projections of long-term expenditures for items such as payroll. we cannot assure you that these activities will be effective in reducing foreign exchange rate exposure. failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. in addition, the majority of our product sales are denominated in u.s. dollars. fluctuations in the exchange rate between the u.s. dollar and the local currency can cause increases or decreases in the cost of our products in the local currency of such customers. an appreciation of the u.s. dollar relative to the local currency could reduce sales of our products.
our inability to effectively control the sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us.
we market and sell our products directly to oems and through authorized third-party distributors. from time to time, our products are diverted from our authorized distribution channels and are sold on the "gray market." gray market products result in shadow inventory that is not visible to us, thus making it difficult to forecast demand accurately. also, when gray market products enter the market, we and our distribution channels compete with these heavily discounted gray market products, which adversely affects demand for our products and negatively impact our margins. in addition, our inability to control gray market activities could result in customer satisfaction issues because any time products are purchased outside our authorized distribution channels there is a risk that our customers are buying counterfeit or substandard products, including products that may have been altered, mishandled or damaged, or are used products represented as new.
if we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property in the united states and abroad, through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other measures, we may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses.
we rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts, including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements, copyrights, patents, trademarks and common law rights, such as trade secrets, to protect our intellectual property. however, we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property from third-party infringement or from misappropriation in the united states and abroad. any patent licensed by us or issued to us could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or rights granted there under may not provide a competitive advantage to us.
furthermore, patent applications that we file may not result in issuance of a patent or, if a patent is issued, the patent may not be issued in a form that is advantageous to us. despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, others may independently develop similar products, duplicate our products or design around our patents and other rights. in addition, it is difficult to monitor compliance with, and enforce, our intellectual property on a worldwide basis in a cost-effective manner. in jurisdictions where foreign laws provide less intellectual property protection than afforded in the united states and abroad, our technology or other intellectual property may be compromised, and our business would be materially adversely affected.
26
we are party to litigation and may become a party to other claims or litigation that could cause us to incur substantial costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit us from selling our products.
from time to time, we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions. for example, on january 15, 2014, march 20, 2014, april 27, 2015 and september 29, 2015, complaints were filed against us seeking damages for alleged securities law violations which are described in note 17 of our consolidated financial statements. our products are purchased by and/or used by consumers, which could increase our exposure to consumer actions such as product liability claims and consumer class action claims. on occasion, we receive claims that individuals were allegedly exposed to substances used in our former semiconductor wafer manufacturing facilities and that this alleged exposure caused harm. litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions, and its outcome is uncertain. any claim that is successfully asserted against us, including the claims filed against us on january 15, 2014, march 20, 2014, april 27, 2015 and september 29, 2015, may result in the payment of damages that could be material to our business.
with respect to intellectual property litigation, from time to time, we have been notified of, or third parties may bring or have brought, actions against us and/or against our customers based on allegations that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others, contributing to or inducing the infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, improperly claiming ownership of intellectual property or otherwise improperly using the intellectual property of others. if any such claims are asserted, we may seek to obtain a license under the third parties' intellectual property rights. we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain all of the necessary licenses on satisfactory terms, if at all. these parties may file lawsuits against us or our customers seeking damages (potentially up to and including treble damages) or an injunction against the sale of products that incorporate allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of our business as presently conducted, which could result in our having to stop the sale of some of our products or to increase the costs of selling some of our products or which could damage our reputation. the award of damages, including material royalty payments, or other types of damages, or the entry of an injunction against the manufacture and sale of some or all of our products could have a material adverse effect on us. we could decide, in the alternative, to redesign our products or to resort to litigation to challenge such claims. such challenges could be extremely expensive and time-consuming regardless of their merit, could cause delays in product release or shipment and/or could have a material adverse effect on us. we cannot assure you that litigation related to our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others can always be avoided or successfully concluded.
even if we were to prevail, any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on us.
our business is subject to potential tax liabilities.
we are subject to income taxes in the united states, canada and other foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, we cannot assure you that the final determination of any tax audits and litigation will not be materially different from that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit, assessment or litigation, there could be a material adverse effect on our cash, income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made.
we are subject to environmental laws, conflict minerals-related provisions of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act as well as a variety of other laws or regulations that could result in additional costs and liabilities.
our operations and properties have in the past been and continue to be subject to various united states and foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to materials used in our products and manufacturing processes, discharge of pollutants into the environment, the treatment, transport, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and remediation of contamination. these laws and regulations require our suppliers to obtain permits for operations making our products, including the discharge of air pollutants and wastewater. although our management systems are designed to oversee our suppliers' compliance, we cannot assure you that our suppliers have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws, regulations and permits. if our suppliers violate or fail to comply with any of them, a range of consequences could result, including fines, suspension of production, alteration of manufacturing processes, import/export restrictions, sales limitations, criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. such non-compliance from our manufacturing suppliers could result in disruptions in supply, higher sourcing costs, and/or reputational damage for us.
environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. for example, the european union (eu) and china are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted restrictions on the use of lead and other materials in electronic products. these regulations affect semiconductor devices and packaging. as regulations
27
restricting materials in electronic products continue to increase around the world, there is a risk that the cost, quality and manufacturing yields of products that are subject to these restrictions, may be less favorable compared to products that are not subject to such restrictions, or that the transition to compliant products may not meet customer roadmaps, or produce sudden changes in demand, which may result in excess inventory. a number of jurisdictions including the eu, australia and china are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulations for computers and servers based on energy star specifications as well as additional energy consumption limits. there is the potential for certain of our products being excluded from some of these markets which could materially adversely affect us.
certain environmental laws, including the u.s. comprehensive, environmental response, compensation and liability act of 1980, or the superfund act, impose strict or, under certain circumstances, joint and several liability on current and previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances and impose liability for damages to natural resources. these laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of, or was not responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances. these environmental laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated. such persons can be responsible for cleanup costs even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility. we have been named as a responsible party at three superfund sites in sunnyvale, california. although we have not yet been, we could be named a potentially responsible party at other superfund or contaminated sites in the future. in addition, contamination that has not yet been identified could exist at our other facilities.
under the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010, the sec adopted disclosure and reporting requirements for companies that use "conflict" minerals originating from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries. we continue to incur additional costs associated with complying with these requirements, such as costs related to developing internal controls for the due diligence process, determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products, auditing the process and reporting to our customers and the sec. in addition to the sec regulation, the european union, china and other jurisdictions are developing new policies focused on conflict minerals that may impact and increase the cost of our compliance program. also, since our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the subject minerals. moreover, we are likely to encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified as "conflict free." if we cannot satisfy these customers, they may choose a competitor's products.
recently, the u.s. federal government has issued new policies for federal procurement focused on eradicating the practice of forced labor and human trafficking. in addition, the united kingdom and the state of california have issued laws that require us to disclose our policy and practices for identifying and eliminating forced labor and human trafficking in our supply chain. several customers as well as the electronic industry citizenship coalition (eicc) have also issued expectations to eliminate these practices that may impact us. while we have a policy and management systems to identify and avoid these practices in our supply chain, we cannot guarantee that our suppliers will always be in conformance to these laws and expectations. we may face enforcement liability and reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently meet these expectations. moreover, we are likely to encounter challenges with customers if we cannot satisfy their forced and trafficked labor polices and they may choose a competitor's products.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements as of december 31, 2016 and december 26, 2015 and for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2016 and related notes, which are included in this annual report on form 10-k as well as with the other sections of this annual report on form 10-k, including "part i, item 1: business," "part ii, item 6: selected financial data" and "part ii, item 8: financial statements and supplementary data."
introduction we are a global semiconductor company primarily offering:
(i)   x86 microprocessors, as standalone devices or as incorporated into an accelerated processing unit (apu), chipsets, discrete graphics processing units (gpus) and professional graphics; and
(ii)   server and embedded processors, semi-custom system-on-chip (soc) products and technology for game consoles. we also license portions of our intellectual property portfolio.
in this md&a, we will describe the results of operations and the financial condition for us and our consolidated subsidiaries, including a discussion of our results of operations for 2016 compared to 2015 and 2015 compared to 2014, an analysis of changes in our financial condition and a discussion of our contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements.
overview as we continued to focus on our strategy to improve our business, we made progress towards strengthening our competitive position and improving our financial performance in 2016. net revenue for 2016 was $4.3 billion, an increase of 7% compared to 2015 net revenue of $4.0 billion. the increase in net revenue from 2015 was due to a 9% increase in computing and graphics segment revenue and a 5% increase in enterprise, embedded and semi-custom segment revenue. computing and graphics segment revenue increased year-over-year primarily due to higher gpu sales, offset by lower microprocessor sales. embedded and semi-custom segment revenue increased year-over-year primarily due to higher semi-custom soc sales.
gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2016, was 23% compared to 27% in 2015. the decrease in gross margin in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to a $340 million charge taken in the third quarter of 2016 (the wsa charge) related to the sixth amendment to the wafer supply agreement (the sixth amendment) with globalfoundries inc. (gf). operating loss for 2016 was $372 million compared to a $481 million for 2015. this improvement in operating performance in 2016 compared to 2015 was due to an increase in net revenue described above, a reduction in restructuring and other special charges, net and a licensing gain related to an intellectual property license agreement in connection with the joint ventures in china that we formed with tianjin haiguang advanced technology investment co. ltd. (thatic), partially offset by an increase in cost of sales due to the wsa charge. during 2016, we continued to closely manage our operating expenses. our operating expenses in 2016 decreased to $1.5 billion, compared to $1.6 billion in 2015, due to the absence of restructuring charges in 2016, partially offset by increased r&d expenses.
in 2016, we continued to improve our balance sheet by reducing our debt and extending our debt maturities. during the third quarter of 2016, we issued $690 million of common stock and $805 million aggregate principal amount of 2.125% convertible senior notes due 2026 (2.125% notes). we used the net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock and the 2.125% notes to pay $230 million of our secured revolving line of credit and repurchase an aggregate principal amount of $796 million of our outstanding 6.75% senior notes due 2019 (6.75% notes), 7.75% senior notes due 2020 (7.75% notes), 7.50% senior notes due 2022 (7.50% notes) and 7.00% senior notes due 2024 (7.00% notes). in the fourth quarter of 2016, we redeemed the remaining $208 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.75% notes and as a result, we no longer have any 7.75% notes outstanding. total debt as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2016 was $1.4 billion, compared to $2.2 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of 2015. our cash and cash equivalents as of december 31, 2016 were $1.3 billion compared to $785 million at december 26, 2015.
during 2016, we continued to execute our roadmap by delivering a number of new products and technologies across our two business segments. in march 2016, we announced new additions to our desktop processor family, with the amd a10-7890k apu designed to help enable smooth play of online games and the amd athlon x4 880k apu that features our "excavator" x86 architecture. also in march, we introduced the radeon pro duo gpu with the liquidvr sdk platform designed for many aspects of vr content creation: from entertainment to education, journalism, medicine and cinema. in may 2016, we introduced our mobile 7th generation a-series processors. our 7th generation a-series processors are designed to provide productivity and entertainment performance with maximum mobility for consumers. also in may, we introduced an amd multiuser gpu (mxgpu) for blade servers, the amd firepro s7100x gpu, designed to provide a "workstation-class" experience for up to 16 users. we launched our first gpu featuring our polaris architecture, the radeontm rx 480 gpu, in june 2016. our polaris architecture features our latest 4th gen graphics core next (gcn), along with the latest display technology support and performance per watt
35
capabilities, all based on a finfet 14 process technology. in july 2016, we revealed our new radeon pro ssg gpu with the ability to expand gpu storage up to 1 terabyte (tb) and which is designed for media and entertainment professionals. we also announced our new radeon pro wx series gpus, which are based on our polaris architecture and designed for workstation professionals and creators. in august 2016, we introduced the new radeon rx 470, targeted at high definition (hd) resolutions for gamers. also in august 2016, we released the new radeon rx 460 graphics card with an ultra-quiet cooling solution and sub-75w power footprint for mainstream and e-sports gaming. we announced two new amd embedded radeon graphics cards, the amd embedded radeon e9260 and the amd embedded radeon e9550 discrete gpu products in september 2016. these gpus bring our polaris architecture to the embedded markets and are designed to elevate the level of gpu processing performance available to embedded customers. in october 2016, we announced the first pcs featuring 7th generation amd pro apus. these apus are built for businesses and designed to deliver increased computing and graphics performance and improved energy efficiency.
in connection with our plans to further sharpen our focus and operations on designing high-performance products, we entered into a definitive agreement to form two joint ventures with tongfu fujitsu microelectronics co., ltd. (formerly, nantong fujitsu microelectronics co., ltd.) (tfme) in the third quarter of 2015. in april 2016, we completed the sale of a majority of the equity interests in suzhou tf amd semiconductor co., ltd. (formerly, amd technologies (china) co., ltd.) and tf amd microelectronics (penang) sdn. bhd. (formerly, advanced micro devices export sdn. bhd.), to affiliates of tfme to form two joint ventures (collectively, atmp jv). as a result of the sale, tfme's affiliates own 85% of the equity interests in the atmp jv while certain of our subsidiaries own the remaining 15%. we received approximately $342 million, including purchase price adjustments, in net cash proceeds for selling 85% of the equity interest in the atmp jv.
in february 2016, as part of our ip monetization strategy, we and thatic formed a joint venture comprised of two separate legal entities, china jv1 and china jv2 (collectively, the thatic jv). our equity share in china jv1 and china jv2 is a majority and minority interest, respectively, funded by our contribution of certain of our patents. the thatic jv's primary purpose is to support our expansion into the server product market in china. we also licensed certain of our intellectual property (licensed ip) to the thatic jv for a total of approximately $293 million in license fees payable over several years contingent upon achievement of certain milestones. we also expect to receive a royalty based on the sales of the thatic jv's products to be developed on the basis of such licensed ip. we will also provide certain engineering and technical support to the thatic jv in connection with the product development.
in addition, we entered into a sixth amendment with gf during the third quarter of 2016. the sixth amendment modifies certain terms of the wafer supply agreement applicable to wafers for our microprocessor, graphics processor and semi-custom products for a five-year period from january 1, 2016 to december 31, 2020. also, in connection with and in consideration for the limited waiver and rights under the sixth amendment, we entered into a warrant agreement (the warrant agreement) with west coast hitech l.p. (wch), a wholly-owned subsidiary of mubadala development company pjsc (mubadala) pursuant to which wch received the right to purchase up to 75 million shares of our common stock.
we intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements.
globalfoundries formation and accounting on march 2, 2009, we consummated the transactions contemplated by the master transaction agreement among us, mubadala technology investments llc, or mubadala tech, (formerly, advanced technology investment company llc) and west coast hitech l.p. (wch), pursuant to which we formed gf. in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the master transaction agreement, amd, mubadala tech and gf entered into a wafer supply agreement (the wsa), a funding agreement (the funding agreement) and a shareholders' agreement (the shareholders' agreement) on march 2, 2009.
on march 4, 2012, as partial consideration for certain rights received under a second amendment to the wsa, we transferred to gf all of the remaining capital stock of gf that we owned. in addition, as of march 4, 2012, the funding agreement was terminated, and we were no longer party to the shareholders' agreement. as a result of these transactions, we no longer owned any gf capital stock as of march 4, 2012.
gf continues to be a related party of us because mubadala development company pjsc (mubadala) and mubadala tech are affiliated with wch, our largest stockholder. wch and mubadala tech are wholly-owned subsidiaries of mubadala.
wafer supply agreement
36
the wsa governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by gf. pursuant to the wsa, we are required to purchase all of our microprocessor and apu product requirements, and a certain portion of our gpu product requirements from gf with limited exceptions. if we acquire a third-party business that manufactures microprocessor and apu products, we will have up to two years to transition the manufacture of such microprocessor and apu products to gf.
the wsa terminates no later than march 2, 2024. gf has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to assist us to transition the supply of products to another provider and to continue to fulfill purchase orders for up to two years following the termination or expiration of the wsa. during the transition period, pricing for microprocessor and apu products will remain as set forth in the wsa, but our purchase commitments to gf will no longer apply.
sixth amendment to wafer supply agreement. on august 30, 2016, we entered into a sixth amendment (the sixth amendment) to the wsa. the sixth amendment modifies certain terms of the wsa applicable to wafers for our microprocessor, graphics processor and semi-custom products for a five-year period from january 1, 2016 to december 31, 2020. amd and gf agreed to establish a comprehensive framework for technology collaboration for the 7nm technology node.
the sixth amendment also provides us a limited waiver with rights to contract with another wafer foundry with respect to certain products in the 14nm and 7nm technology nodes and gives us greater flexibility in sourcing foundry services across our product portfolio. in consideration for these rights, we agreed to pay gf $100 million in installments starting in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016 through the third fiscal quarter of 2017. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we paid gf $25 million. starting in 2017 and continuing through 2020, we also agreed to make quarterly payments to gf based on the volume of certain wafers purchased from another wafer foundry.
further, for each calendar year during the term of the sixth amendment, amd and gf agreed to annual wafer purchase targets that increase from 2016 through 2020. if we do not meet the annual wafer purchase target for any calendar year, we will be required to pay to gf a portion of the difference between our actual wafer purchases and the wafer purchase target for that year. the annual targets were established based on our current business and market expectations and take into account the limited waiver we have received for certain products.
amd and gf also agreed on fixed pricing for wafers purchased during 2016 and established a framework to agree on annual wafer pricing for the years 2017 to 2020.
our total purchases from gf related to wafer manufacturing and research and development activities were approximately $0.7 billion for 2016, $0.9 billion for 2015 and $1.0 billion for 2014.
warrant agreement. also on august 30, 2016, in consideration of the limited waiver and rights under the sixth amendment, we entered into a warrant agreement (the warrant agreement) with wch, a wholly-owned subsidiary of mubadala. under the warrant agreement, wch and its permitted assigns are entitled to purchase 75 million shares of our common stock (the warrant shares) at a purchase price of $5.98 per share. the warrant under the warrant agreement is exercisable in whole or in part until february 29, 2020, provided that the maximum number of warrant shares that may be exercised prior to the one-year anniversary of the warrant agreement shall not exceed 50 million. notwithstanding the foregoing, the warrant agreement will only be exercisable to the extent that mubadala does not beneficially own, either directly through any other entities directly and indirectly owned by mubadala or its subsidiaries, an aggregate of more than 19.99% of our outstanding capital stock after any such exercise.
during 2016, we recorded a charge of $340 million, consisting of the $100 million payment under the sixth amendment and the $240 million value of the warrant under the warrant agreement issued in consideration of the sixth amendment.
equity interest purchase agreement - atmp joint venture on april 29, 2016, we and certain of our subsidiaries completed the sale of a majority of the equity interests in suzhou tf-amd semiconductor co., ltd. (formerly, amd technologies (china) co., ltd.), and tf amd microelectronics (penang) sdn. bhd. (formerly, advanced micro devices export sdn. bhd.), to affiliates of tongfu microelectronics co., ltd. (formerly, nantong fujitsu microelectronics co., ltd.) (tfme), a chinese joint stock company, to form two joint ventures (collectively, the atmp jv). as a result of the sale, tfme's affiliates own 85% of the equity interests in the atmp jv while certain of our subsidiaries own the remaining 15%. we have no obligations to fund the atmp jv.
as a result of the transaction, we received approximately $342 million, including purchase price adjustments, in net cash proceeds for selling 85% of the equity interest in each of suzhou tf-amd semiconductor co., ltd. and tf amd microelectronics (penang) sdn. bhd. these proceeds, net of certain transaction costs, were included in investing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended december 31, 2016.
we recognized a net pre-tax gain on the sale of the 85% equity interest in atmp jv of $146 million for the year ended december 31, 2016, which was recognized in other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of operations. the net pre-tax gain reflects the excess of the sum of net cash proceeds and fair value of our retained 15% equity interests in the atmp jv over the sum of the net book values of our former subsidiaries and other closing costs directly attributed to the divestiture. the above gain includes $11 million in excess of fair value of our retained interest over the corresponding net book values.
in determining the fair value of our retained 15% equity interests in the atmp jv, we used quoted prices from comparable bids for this transaction. we also considered other factors including the control premium and the amount of consideration received for the portion sold.
we account for our equity interests in the atmp jv under the equity method of accounting due to our significant influence over the atmp jv. as of december 31, 2016, the carrying value of our investment in the atmp jv was approximately $59 million.
following the deconsolidation, the atmp jv is our related party. the atmp jv provides assembly, test, mark and packaging (atmp) services to us. we currently pay the atmp jv for atmp services on a cost-plus basis. our total purchases from the atmp jv during the year ended december 31, 2016 amounted to approximately $265 million. our payable to the atmp jv, as of december 31, 2016, was $128 million.
during the year ended december 31, 2016, we recorded a $10 million loss in equity in income (loss) of atmp jv on our consolidated statements of operations, which included certain expenses incurred by us on behalf of the atmp jv.
equity joint venture - intellectual property licensing agreement in february 2016, we and thatic, a third-party chinese entity (jv partner), formed a joint venture comprised of two separate legal entities, china jv1 and china jv2 (collectively, the thatic jv). our equity share in china jv1 and china jv2 is a majority and minority interest, respectively, funded by our contribution of certain of our patents. the jv partner is responsible for the initial and on-going financing of the thatic jv's operations. we have no obligations to fund the thatic jv. the thatic jv's primary purpose is to support our expansion into the server and workstation product market in china. we licensed certain of our intellectual property (licensed ip) to the thatic jv for a total of approximately $293 million in license fees payable over several years contingent upon achievement of certain milestones. we also expect to receive a royalty based on the sales of the thatic jv's products to be developed on the basis of such licensed ip. we will also provide certain engineering and technical support to the thatic jv in connection with the product development.
we concluded the china jv1 and china jv2 are not operating joint ventures and are variable interest entities due to their reliance on on-going financing by jv partner. we determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of either china jv1 or china jv2, as we do not have unilateral power to direct selling and marketing activities, manufacturing and product development activities related to the thatic jv's products. accordingly we will not consolidate either of these entities and therefore account for our investments in the thatic jv under the equity method of accounting. thatic jv is our related party.
income related to the licensed ip will be recognized over the period commencing upon delivery of the first licensed ip milestone through the date of the milestone that requires our continuing involvement in the product development process. royalty payments will be recognized in income once earned. we will classify licensed ip income and royalty income as other operating income. during the year ended december 31, 2016, we recognized $88 million of licensing gain associated with the thatic jv as part of operating income.
our total exposure to losses through our investment in the thatic jv is limited to our investments in the thatic jv, which was zero as of december 31, 2016. our share in the net losses of the thatic jv for the year ended december 31, 2016 was not material and is not recorded in our consolidated statement of operations since we are not obligated to fund the thatic jv's losses in excess of our investment in the thatic jv.
as of december 31, 2016, the total assets and liabilities of the thatic jv were not material.
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap). the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. we evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to our revenue, inventories, goodwill impairments and income taxes. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
37
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management's expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions.
management believes the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.
revenue allowances. we record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales for estimated future price reductions and other customer incentives in the same period that the related revenues are recorded. we base these estimates on actual historical sales returns, historical allowances, historical price reductions, market activity and other known or anticipated trends and factors. these estimates are subject to management's judgment and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and operating results.
inventory valuation. at each balance sheet date, we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence based on projected sales outlook. this evaluation includes analysis of historical sales levels by product and projections of future demand. these projections assist us in determining the carrying value of our inventory. in addition, we write off inventories that we consider obsolete. we adjust the remaining specific inventory balances to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or market value. among other factors, management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence and market value. if, in any period, we anticipate future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. this would have a negative impact on our gross margin in that period. if in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written down in a previous period, related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sales, resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period.
goodwill. goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment present.
we perform an annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year. in assessing impairment on goodwill, we first analyze qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. the qualitative factors we assess include long-term prospects of our performance, share price trends, market capitalization and company-specific events. if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we do not need to perform the two-step impairment test. if based on that assessment, we believe it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a two-step goodwill impairment test will be performed.
the first step measures for impairment by applying fair value-based tests at the reporting unit level. we evaluate whether goodwill has been impaired at the reporting unit level by first determining whether the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value and, if so, by determining whether the implied fair value of goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value. the implied fair value of a reporting unit is determined through the application of one or more valuation models common to our industry, including the income, market and cost approaches. while market valuation data for comparable companies is gathered and analyzed, we believe that there has not been sufficient comparability between the peer groups and the specific reporting units to allow for the derivation of reliable indications of value using a market approach. therefore, we have ultimately employed the income approach which requires estimates of present value of estimated future cash flows. cash flow projections are based on management's estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and market condition. the discount rate used is based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. a variance in the discount rate could have a significant impact on the amount of the goodwill impairment charge recorded, if any. the second step (if necessary) measures the amount of impairment by applying fair value-based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit.
based on the results of our annual qualitative analysis of goodwill in 2016, we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount and, as such, we did not need to perform the two-step impairment test and there was no goodwill impairment.
based on the results of our annual analysis of goodwill in 2015, each reporting unit's fair value exceeded its carrying value, indicating that there was no goodwill impairment.
38
based on the results of our annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2014, we determined that the carrying value of the computing and graphics reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value and accordingly an impairment charge of $233 million was recorded, which represented the entire goodwill balance within this reporting unit. the remaining two reporting units' estimated fair values exceeded their carrying value, ranging from approximately 156% to approximately 209%. in estimating the fair value of our reporting units, we took into consideration the challenging industry and market trends that existed as of september 28, 2014, the date of the annual goodwill impairment test for each respective reporting unit.
estimates of fair value for all of our reporting units can be affected by a variety of external and internal factors. potential events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the key assumptions we used in estimating the fair value of our reporting units include adverse changes in our industry, increased competition, an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace or to achieve internal forecasts, and a decline in our stock price. if the estimated fair value of our reporting units declines due to any of these factors, we may be required to record future goodwill impairment.
income taxes. in determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. these estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes.
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. if recovery is not likely, we must increase our charge to income tax expense, in the form of a valuation allowance, for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. we consider past performance, future expected taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance.
in addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the internal revenue service or other taxing authority. if our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results, an additional tax benefit or charge will result. we recognize the interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and income tax expense, respectively.
results of operations management, including the chief operating decision maker, who is our chief executive officer, reviews and assesses our operating performance using segment net revenue and operating income (loss) before interest, other income (expense), net, income taxes and equity in income (loss) of atmp jv. these performance measures include the allocation of expenses to the operating segments based on management's judgment. we have the following two reportable segments:
•   the computing and graphics segment, which primarily includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets, discrete gpus and professional graphics; and
•   the enterprise, embedded and semi-custom segment, which primarily includes server and embedded processors, semi-custom soc products, development services, technology for game consoles and licensing portions of our intellectual property portfolio.
in addition to these reportable segments, we have an all other category, which is not a reportable segment. this category primarily includes certain expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of the reportable segments because management does not consider these expenses and credits in evaluating the performance of the reportable segments. included in this category are employee stock-based compensation expense, the charge related to the sixth amendment to the wsa with gf, restructuring and other special charges, net, amortization of acquired intangible assets, workforce rebalancing severance charges, goodwill impairment charge and significant or unusual lower of cost or market inventory adjustments. we also reported the results of former businesses in the all other category because the operating results were not material.
we intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist you in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, the primary factors that resulted in those changes and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements.
we use a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the last saturday in december. the years ended december 31, 2016, december 26, 2015 and december 27, 2014 included 53 weeks, 52 weeks and 52 weeks, respectively. the extra week in 2016 did not have a material impact on our results of operations. references in this report to 2016, 2015 and 2014 refer to the fiscal year unless explicitly stated otherwise.
the following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment and income (loss) before income taxes and equity in income (loss) of atmp jv for 2016, 2015 and 2014.

computing and graphics computing and graphics net revenue of $2.0 billion in 2016 increased by 9% compared to $1.8 billion in 2015 as a result of a 9% increase in unit shipments, partially offset by a 2% decrease in average selling price. the increase in unit shipments was primarily attributable to higher unit shipments of our gpu products, partially offset by lower unit shipments of our microprocessor products. the increase of unit shipments of our gpu products was primarily driven by demand for our polaris architecture-based gpu products. the decrease in unit shipments of our microprocessor products was primarily due to lower unit shipments of our desktop microprocessor products due to lower demand, partially offset by higher shipments of notebook microprocessor products driven by higher demand for our 7th generation a-series notebook processors. the decrease in average selling price was primarily attributable to a decrease in average selling price of our desktop microprocessor and notebook gpu products due to a shift in our product mix, partially offset by an increase in average selling price of our channel gpu products primarily due to strong demand for our polaris architecture-based gpu products.
computing and graphics net revenue of $1.8 billion in 2015 decreased by 42% compared to $3.1 billion in 2014 as a result of a 44% decrease in unit shipments, partially offset by a 3% increase in average selling price. unit shipments of all our computing and graphics products decreased. the decrease in unit shipments of all categories of products was due to lower demand caused by challenging global macro-economic conditions, especially in the greater china region, in addition to increased competitive pressures and reduced demand from our oem customers in advance of the microsoft windows® 10 operating system. the increase in average selling price was primarily attributable to an increase in average selling price of our notebook gpu products and channel gpu products due to a shift in our product mix, partially offset by a decrease in average selling price of our notebook microprocessor products and chipset products.
computing and graphics operating loss was $238 million in 2016 compared to an operating loss of $502 million in 2015. the improvement in operating results was primarily due to the increase in net revenue referenced above and a decrease in operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in cost of sales primarily due to higher sales in 2016 compared to 2015. in 2015, cost of sales included an inventory write-down of $52 million as a result of lower than anticipated demand for primarily older-generation apu products. operating expenses decreased for the reasons set forth under "expenses" below.
computing and graphics operating loss was $502 million in 2015 compared to an operating loss of $76 million in 2014. the decline in operating results was primarily due to the decrease in net revenue referenced above, partially offset by a $696 million decrease in cost of sales and a decrease in operating expenses. cost of sales decreased primarily due to lower unit shipments in 2015 compared to 2014, partially offset by an inventory write-down of $52 million as a result of lower anticipated demand for primarily older-generation apu products. operating loss in 2014 included a $19 million benefit from technology licensing revenue. operating expenses decreased for the reasons set forth under "expenses" below.
enterprise, embedded and semi-custom enterprise, embedded and semi-custom net revenue of $2.3 billion in 2016 increased by 5% compared to net revenue of $2.2 billion in 2015. the increase in net revenue was primarily due to an increase in unit shipments of our semi-custom soc products and non-recurring engineering (nre) revenue. the increase in unit shipments was primarily driven by increased demand.
39
enterprise, embedded and semi-custom net revenue of $2.2 billion in 2015 decreased by 8% compared to net revenue of $2.4 billion in 2014. the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net revenue received in connection with lower unit shipments of our server and embedded products due primarily to increased competitive pressures, as well as a decrease in net revenue from certain royalty arrangements and a decrease in nre revenue. the decrease in net revenue was partially offset by an increase in net revenue received in connection with higher unit shipments of our semi-custom soc products.
enterprise, embedded and semi-custom operating income was $283 million in 2016 compared to $215 million in 2015. the improvement in operating results was primarily due to the increase in net revenue referenced above, an $88 million licensing gain recorded in 2016 related to the licensed ip to the thatic jv, and a decrease in cost of sales, in part due to the absence of a technology node transition charge of $33 million recorded in 2015, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. operating expenses increased for the reasons set forth under "expenses" below.
enterprise, embedded and semi-custom operating income was $215 million in 2015 compared to $399 million in 2014. the decline in operating results was primarily due to the decrease in net revenue referenced above, partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses and a decrease in cost of sales. the decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to a decrease in unit shipments of our server and embedded products in 2015 compared to 2014, largely offset by a technology node transition charge of $33 million and an inventory write-down of $13 million. operating expenses decreased for the reasons set forth under "expenses" below.
all other all other operating loss of $417 million in 2016 included a charge of $340 million, which was comprised of the $100 million payment under the sixth amendment and the $240 million value of the warrant under the warrant agreement, and stock-based compensation expense of $86 million, partially offset by restructuring reversals of $10 million.
all other operating loss of $194 million in 2015 included restructuring and other special charges, net of $129 million and stock-based compensation expense of $63 million. restructuring and other special charges, net of $129 million included $76 million related to our decision to exit from the dense server systems business, $37 million related to our 2015 restructuring plan and $16 million related to our 2014 restructuring plan.
all other operating loss of $478 million in 2014 included a goodwill impairment charge of $233 million, stock-based compensation expense of $81 million, restructuring and other special charges, net of $71 million, lower of cost or market inventory adjustment of $58 million, workforce rebalancing severance charges of $14 million, amortization of acquired intangible assets of $14 million and other expenses of $7 million.

expenses research and development expenses research and development expenses of $1.0 billion in 2016 increased by $61 million, or 6%, compared to $0.9 billion in 2015. the increase was primarily due to a $138 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our enterprise, embedded and semi-custom segment and a $13 million increase attributable to our all other category, partially offset by a $90 million decrease in research and development expenses attributable to our computing and graphics segment. research and development expenses attributable to our enterprise, embedded and semi-custom segment increased primarily due to a $128 million increase in product engineering and design costs. research and development expenses attributable to our all other category increased primarily due to a $13 million increase in stock-based compensation expense. research and development expenses attributable to our computing and graphics segment decreased primarily due to a $108 million decrease in product engineering and design costs.
research and development expenses of $947 million in 2015 decreased by $125 million, or 12%, compared to $1.1 billion in 2014. the decrease was primarily due to a $120 million decrease in research and development expenses attributable to our computing and graphics segment and a $21 million decrease in the all other category primarily related to a $9 million workforce rebalancing severance charge recorded in 2014 and an $8 million decrease in stock-based compensation expenses. the decrease was partially offset by a $16 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our enterprise, embedded and semi-custom segment. research and development expenses attributable to our computing and graphics segment decreased primarily due to a $116 million decrease in product engineering and design costs and a $4 million decrease in other employee compensation and benefit expenses. research and development expenses attributable to our enterprise, embedded and semi-custom segment increased primarily due to a $17 million increase in product engineering and design costs.
marketing, general and administrative expenses marketing, general and administrative expenses of $460 million in 2016 decreased by $22 million, or 5%, compared to $482 million in 2015. the decrease was primarily due to a $40 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our computing and graphics segment primarily due to an $18 million decrease in sales and marketing activities and a $22 million decrease in other general and administrative expenses, partially offset by a $6 million increase in other general and administrative expenses attributable to our enterprise, embedded and semi-custom segment and a $12 million increase attributable to our all other category primarily due to an $11 million increase in stock-based compensation expense.
marketing, general and administrative expenses of $482 million in 2015 decreased by $122 million, or 20%, compared to $604 million in 2014. the decrease was primarily due to an $84 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our computing and graphics segment, a $19 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our enterprise, embedded and semi-custom segment and a $19 million decrease in the all other category primarily related to a $5 million workforce rebalancing severance charge recorded in 2014 and a $10 million decrease in stock-based compensation expenses. marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our computing and graphics segment

decreased primarily due to a $62 million decrease in sales and marketing expenses and a $22 million decrease in other general and administrative expenses. marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our enterprise, embedded and semi-custom segment decreased primarily due to a $5 million decrease in sales and marketing expenses and a $14 million decrease in other general and administrative expenses.
legal settlements as of december 26, 2015, the italian tax authorities had concluded their audit of our subsidiaries' activities in italy for the years 2003 through 2013. we entered into a settlement for $11 million in taxes and penalties, which was reflected in full in the 2015 tax provision and $2 million in interest.
amortization of acquired intangible assets amortization of acquired intangible assets was $0 million in 2016, $3 million in 2015 and $14 million in 2014. the decrease from 2014 to 2015 was due to the impairment of intangible assets as a result of our exit from the dense server systems business in the first quarter of 2015. the related intangible assets were fully amortized as of december 26, 2015.
restructuring and other special charges, net effects of restructuring plans
2015 restructuring plan in the third quarter of 2015, we implemented a restructuring plan (2015 restructuring plan) focused on our ongoing efforts to simplify our business and better align resources around our priorities and business outlook. the 2015 restructuring plan involved a reduction of global headcount by approximately 5% and included organizational actions such as outsourcing certain it services and application development. during 2015, we recorded a $37 million restructuring charge, which consisted of $27 million for severance and benefit costs, $1 million for facilities-related costs and $9 million for intangible asset-related charges. the actions associated with the 2015 restructuring plan will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2017.

dense server systems business exit as a part of our strategy to simplify and sharpen our investment focus, we exited the dense server systems business, formerly seamicro, in the first quarter of 2015. as a result, we recorded a charge of $76 million in "restructuring and other special charges, net" on our consolidated statements of operations during 2015. this charge consisted of an impairment charge of $62 million related to the acquired intangible assets. we concluded that the carrying value of the acquired intangible assets associated with our dense server systems business was fully impaired as we did not have plans to utilize the related freedom fabric technology in any of our future products nor did we have any plans at that time to monetize the associated intellectual property. in addition, the exit charge consisted of a $7 million non-cash charge related to asset impairments, $4 million of severance and related benefits and $3 million for contract or program termination costs. we substantially completed this exit activity during the second quarter of 2016.
executive officer separation in the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded other special charges of $13 million. the amount primarily included $10 million due to the departure of our former ceo, of which $5 million was related to cash and $5 million was related to stock-based compensation expense. the amount is recorded under "restructuring and other special charges, net" on the consolidated statements of operations.
interest expense interest expense of $156 million in 2016 decreased by $4 million compared to $160 million in 2015, primarily due to the repurchases of debt bearing higher interest rates and issuance of new debt at a lower interest rate in late 2016.
interest expense of $160 million in 2015 decreased by $17 million compared to $177 million in 2014, primarily due to timing of issuances of new debt and repurchases of other debt in 2014.
other income (expense), net in 2016, we recognized $80 million of other income, net, primarily due to the net gain on sale of equity interests in the atmp jv of $146 million, partially offset by the $68 million total loss on debt repurchases.
in 2015, we recognized $5 million of other expense, net, primarily due to a loss from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
in 2014, we recognized $66 million of other expense, net, primarily due to a $61 million loss from debt repurchases and a $7 million loss from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, partially offset by $3 million of interest income.
income taxes we recorded an income tax provision of $39 million, $14 million and $5 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
the income tax provision in 2016 was primarily due to $41 million of foreign taxes in profitable locations including $27 million attributable to gain on the sale of 85% of the ownership interest in the subsidiary operating a factory in suzhou and $9 million of withholding taxes on cross-border transactions where no foreign tax credit is expected to be available, offset by $2 million of tax benefits for canadian tax credits and the monetization of certain u.s. tax credits.
the income tax provision in 2015 was primarily due to $16 million of foreign taxes in profitable locations, offset by $2 million of tax benefits for canadian tax credits and the monetization of certain u.s. tax credits.
the income tax provision in 2014 was primarily due to $7 million of foreign taxes in profitable locations, offset by $2 million of tax benefits for canadian tax credits and the monetization of certain u.s. tax credits.
as of december 31, 2016, substantially all of our u.s. and foreign deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, continued to be subject to a valuation allowance. the realization of these assets is dependent on substantial future taxable income which, at december 31, 2016, in management's estimate, is not more likely than not to be achieved.
as of december 26, 2015, the italian tax authorities had concluded their audit of our subsidiaries' activities in italy for the years 2003 through 2013. we entered into a settlement for $11 million in taxes and penalties, which was reflected in full in the 2015 tax provision, and $2 million in interest.
stock-based compensation expense we allocated stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options and restricted stock units for the years ended december 31, 2016, december 26, 2015 and december 27, 2014 in our consolidated statements of operations as follows:
2016                                                                            2015            2014

total stock-based compensation expense, net of tax of $0     $86             $63             $81
during 2016, 2015 and 2014, we did not realize any excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and therefore we did not record any effects relating to financing cash flows.
stock-based compensation expense of $86 million in 2016 increased by $23 million as compared to $63 million in 2015. the increase was primarily due to a higher weighted average grant date fair value and higher number of shares related to restricted stock units granted in 2016, compared to the restricted stock units granted in 2013, which became fully amortized in 2016. the increase was also driven by performance-based restricted stock units with market conditions granted in 2015 and 2016.
stock-based compensation expense of $63 million in 2015 decreased by $18 million as compared to $81 million in 2014. the decrease was primarily due to a lower weighted average grant date fair value and the effect of the 2015 and 2014 restructuring plans.
international sales international sales as a percentage of net revenue were 78% in 2016, 75% in 2015 and 81% in 2014. the increase in international sales as a percentage of net revenue in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily driven by a higher proportion of revenue from international sales of our semi-custom soc products.
the decrease in international sales as a percentage of net revenue in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily driven by a decrease in sales in china. we expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. substantially all of our sales transactions were denominated in u.s. dollars.
financial condition liquidity as of december 31, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents consisted of cash, government money market funds and commercial paper. our cash and cash equivalents as of december 31, 2016 were $1.3 billion compared to $785 million as of december 26, 2015. the increase during the year was due to net cash provided by our operating, investing and financing activities discussed below. the percentage of cash and cash equivalents held domestically was 98% as of december 31, 2016, and 88% as of december 26, 2015.
our cash flows for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:
2016                                                                            2015              2014

our debt obligations of $1.4 billion net of unamortized debt discount of $308 million associated with the 2.125% notes as of december 31, 2016 decreased compared to $2.2 billion as of december 26, 2015.
we believe our cash and cash equivalents balance along with our secured revolving line of credit will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures, over the next 12 months. we believe that in the event we decide to obtain external funding, we may be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives.
should we require additional funding, such as to meet payment obligations of our long-term debt when due, we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities, which may be issued from time to time under an effective registration statement, through the issuance of securities in a transaction exempt from registration under the securities act of 1933, as amended, or a combination of one or more of the foregoing. uncertain global economic conditions have in the past adversely impacted, and may in the future adversely impact, our business. if market conditions deteriorate, we may be limited in our ability to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs on favorable terms or at all, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, including our ability to refinance maturing liabilities.
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was $90 million in 2016 compared to net cash used in operating activities of $226 million in 2015. the improvement in cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to lower operating expenses, including lower labor costs and lower restructuring-related payments, receipt of $97 million associated with the licensing agreement with thatic jv and higher sales and timing of related collections, partially offset by timing of accounts payable payments.
net cash used in operating activities was $226 million in 2015 compared to $98 million in 2014. the increase in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to lower cash collections during 2015 compared 2014 driven by lower sales compared to 2014, partially offset by lower other operating expenses and labor cost as a result of restructuring actions and the absence of the final $200 million cash payment made in the first quarter of 2014 related to gf's waiver of a portion of our obligations for wafer purchase commitments.
investing activities
41
net cash provided by investing activities was $267 million in 2016, which consisted of a net cash inflow of $342 million from sale of equity interests in the atmp jv, partially offset by a cash outflow of $77 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment.
net cash provided by investing activities was $147 million in 2015, which consisted of a net cash inflow of $235 million from purchases, sales and maturities of available for sale securities, partially offset by a net cash outflow of $88 million for purchases and sales of property, plant and equipment.
net cash used in investing activities was $12 million in 2014, which consisted of a cash outflow of $95 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment, offset by a net cash inflow of $83 million from purchases, sales and maturities of available for sale securities.
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was $122 million in 2016, primarily due to the $782 million net proceeds from the issuance of our 2.125% notes, the $667 million net proceeds from selling 115 million shares of our common stock and the $20 million proceeds from issuance of common stock under stock-based compensation equity plans, partially offset by the repurchases of an aggregate principal amount of $1.1 billion of our outstanding 6.75% notes, 7.75% notes, 7.50% notes and 7.00% notes for $1.1 billion in cash and repayments in aggregate of $230 million of our secured revolving line of credit.
net cash provided by financing activities was $59 million in 2015, primarily due to net proceeds from borrowings pursuant to our secured revolving line of credit of $100 million, of which $42 million was used to repay the remaining aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% convertible senior notes due 2015 (6.00% notes) during the second quarter of 2015. in addition, during 2015, we received $5 million from the exercise of employee stock options.
net cash provided by financing activities was $46 million in 2014, primarily due to net proceeds from borrowings pursuant to our 6.75% notes of $589 million, our 7.00% notes of $491 million and our secured revolving line of credit of $75 million, partially offset by $518 million in payments to repurchase a portion of our 6.00% notes, $522 million in payments to repurchase our 8.125% senior notes due 2017 (8.125% notes), $48 million in payments to repurchase a portion of our 7.75% notes, $24 million in payments to repurchase a portion of our 7.50% notes and $3 million in payments for capital lease obligations. during 2014, we also received $4 million from the exercise of employee stock options.
during 2016, 2015 and 2014, we did not realize any excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. therefore, we did not record any effects relating to financing cash flows for these periods.

if we undergo a fundamental change prior to the maturity date of the notes, holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.

secured revolving line of credit loan and security agreement
44
we and our subsidiary, amd international sales & service, ltd. (together, the borrowers), entered into a loan and security agreement on november 12, 2013, as amended on december 11, 2014 (the loan agreement) for our secured revolving line of credit for a principal amount of up to $500 million (the secured revolving line of credit), with up to $75 million available for issuance of letters of credit, with a group of lenders and bank of america, n.a., acting as agent for the lenders (the agent). our secured revolving line of credit had a maturity date of november 12, 2018. borrowings under our secured revolving line of credit were limited to up to 85% of eligible account receivable minus certain reserves and may be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital needs.
amended and restated loan and security agreement on april 14, 2015, the borrowers and ati technologies ulc (collectively, the loan parties), amended and restated the loan agreement (the amended and restated loan agreement) by and among the loan parties, the financial institutions party thereto from time to time as lenders (the lenders) and the agent.
the amended and restated loan agreement provides for a secured revolving line of credit for a principal amount up to $500 million with up to $75 million available for issuance of letters of credit, which remained unchanged from the loan agreement. borrowings under the secured revolving line of credit are limited to up to 85% of eligible accounts receivable (90% for certain qualified eligible accounts receivable), minus specified reserves. the size of the commitments under the secured revolving line of credit may be increased by up to an aggregate amount of $200 million.
the secured revolving line of credit matures on april 14, 2020 and is secured by a first priority security interest in the loan parties' accounts receivable, inventory, deposit accounts maintained with the agent and other specified assets, including books and records.
during 2016, we repaid an aggregate of $230 million of the secured revolving line of credit. at december 31, 2016, we did not have any borrowings outstanding under the secured revolving line of credit. at december 26, 2015, the secured revolving line of credit had an outstanding loan balance of $230 million, at an interest rate of 4.00%. at december 31, 2016, the secured revolving line of credit had $19 million related to outstanding letters of credit and up to $121 million available for future borrowings. we report our intra-period changes in our revolving credit balance on a net basis in our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows as we intend the period of the borrowings to be brief, repaying borrowed amounts within 90 days. as of december 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all required covenants stated in the amended and restated loan agreement.
the agreements governing our 6.75% notes, 7.50% notes, 7.00% notes, 2.125% notes and our secured revolving line of credit contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross defaults under agreements covering other borrowings. the occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable note holders or the lenders under the secured revolving line of credit to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable.
first amendment to the amended and restated loan and security agreement on june 10, 2015, the loan parties entered into a first amendment to the amended and restated loan and security agreement (the first amendment) by and among the loan parties, the lenders and the agent, which modifies the amended and restated loan and security agreement. amendments to the amended and restated loan agreement effected by the first amendment included the addition of exceptions to the liens and asset sale covenants to permit the loan parties to enter into certain supply chain finance arrangements, as well as the addition of certain definitions related thereto.
second amendment to the amended and restated loan and security agreement on april 29, 2016, the loan parties entered into a second amendment to the amended and restated loan and security agreement (the second amendment) by and among the loan parties, the lenders and the agent, which modifies the amended and restated loan and security agreement. the primary amendment to the amended and restated loan agreement effected by the second amendment related to the expansion of the definition of permitted asset dispositions to include the sale or transfer of inventory to the atmp jv pursuant to the equity interest purchase agreement between us and tfme.

obligations to gf as of december 31, 2016, our minimum wafer purchase obligations for the years 2017 through 2020 are approximately $3.3 billion. we cannot meaningfully quantify or estimate our future purchase obligations to gf beyond this amount but expect that our future purchases from gf will continue to be material.

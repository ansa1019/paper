item 1a.  risk factors as previously discussed, our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements. factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below. these and many other factors described in this report could adversely affect our operations, performance and financial condition.
if we cannot continue to develop, market and offer new products and services or enhancements to existing products and services that meet customer requirements, our operating results could suffer.
the process of developing new technology products and services and enhancing existing offerings is complex, costly and uncertain. if we fail to anticipate customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends, our market share and results of operations could suffer. we must make long-term investments, develop or obtain appropriate intellectual property and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products and services. if we are unable to extend our core technologies into new applications and platforms and to anticipate or respond to technological trends, the market's acceptance of our products and services could decline and our results would suffer. additionally, any delay in the development, marketing or launch of a new offering or enhancement to an existing offering could result in customer attrition or impede our ability to attract new customers, causing a decline in our revenue, earnings or stock price and weakening our competitive position. furthermore, third parties market certain of our offerings and support certain product functionality. if we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our strategic relationships with these third parties, our ability to compete in the marketplace, to reach new customers and geographies or to grow our revenue could be impaired and our operating results could suffer.
we offer our products on a variety of hardware platforms. consumers continue to shift away from personal computers to tablet and mobile devices. if we cannot continue to adapt our products to tablet and mobile devices, our business could be harmed. to the extent that consumer purchases of these devices slow down, or to the extent that significant demand arises for our products or competitive products on other platforms before we offer our products on those platforms, our business could be harmed. releases of new devices or operating systems may make it more difficult for our products to perform or may require significant costs in order for us to adapt our solutions to such devices or operating systems. these potential costs and delays could harm our business.
introduction of new products, services and business models by competitors or others could harm our competitive position and results of operations.
the markets for our products and services are characterized by intense competition, evolving industry standards, emerging business and distribution models, disruptive technology developments, short life cycles, customer price sensitivity and frequent new product introductions (including alternatives with limited functionality available at lower costs or free of charge). any of these factors could create downward pressure on pricing and gross margins and could adversely affect our renewal and upgrade rates, as well as our ability to attract new customers. our future success will depend on our continued ability to enhance and better integrate our existing products and services, introduce new products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner, meet changing customer needs, extend our core technology into new applications, and anticipate emerging standards, business models, software delivery methods and other technological developments. if any competing products, services or operating systems that are not compatible with our solutions achieve widespread acceptance, our operating results could suffer. in addition, consolidation has occurred among some of the competitors in the markets in which we compete. further consolidations in these markets may subject us to increased competitive pressures and may therefore harm our results of operations.
the introduction of certain technologies may reduce the effectiveness of our products. for example, some of our products rely on third-party cookies, which are placed on individual browsers when consumers visit websites that contain advertisements. we use these cookies to help our customers more effectively advertise, to gauge the performance of their advertisements, and to detect and prevent fraudulent activity. consumers can block or delete cookies through their browsers or "ad-blocking" software or applications. the most common internet browsers allow consumers to modify their browser settings to prevent cookies from being accepted by their browsers, or are set to block third-party cookies by default. increased use of methods, software or applications that block cookies could harm our business.
for additional information regarding our competition and the risks arising out of the competitive environment in which we operate, see the section entitled "competition" contained in part i, item 1 of this report.
we may be unable to predict subscription renewal rates and the impact these rates may have on our future revenue and operating results.
the hosted business model we use in our adobe marketing cloud offerings typically involves selling services on a subscription basis pursuant to service agreements that are generally one to three years in length. our individual creative cloud and document cloud subscription agreements are generally month-to-month or one year in length, etlas for our digital media
20
products and services are generally three years in length, and subscription agreements for other products and services may provide for shorter or longer terms. our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their initial subscription period, and some customers elect not to renew. we cannot provide assurance that our subscriptions will be renewed at the same or higher level of service, for the same number of seats or licenses or for the same duration of time, if at all. moreover, under certain circumstances, some of our customers have the right to cancel their service agreements prior to the expiration of the terms of their agreements. we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to accurately predict future customer renewal rates. our customers' renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their level of satisfaction with our services, our ability to continue to regularly add features and functionality, the reliability (including uptime) of our subscription services, the prices of our services, the actual or perceived information security of our systems and services, the prices of services offered by our competitors, mergers and acquisitions affecting our customer base, reductions in our customers' spending levels or declines in customer activity as a result of economic downturns or uncertainty in financial markets. if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services or if they renew on terms less favorable to us, our revenue may decline.
our future growth is also affected by our ability to sell additional features and services to our current customers, which depends on a number of factors, including customers' satisfaction with our products and services, the level of innovation reflected in those additional features, the prices of our offerings and general economic conditions. if our efforts to cross-sell and upsell to our customers are unsuccessful, the rate at which our business grows may decline.
subscription offerings and etlas could create risks related to the timing of revenue recognition.
our subscription model creates certain risks related to the timing of revenue recognition and potential reductions in cash flows. a portion of the subscription-based revenue we report each quarter results from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any period may not be immediately reflected in our reported financial results for that period, but may result in a decline in our revenue in future quarters. if we were to experience significant downturns in subscription sales and renewal rates, our reported financial results might not reflect such downturns until future periods. our subscription model could also make it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue from subscription-based or hosted services through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers will be recognized over the applicable subscription term.
additionally, in connection with our sales efforts to enterprise customers and our use of etlas, a number of factors could affect our revenue, including longer-than-expected sales and implementation cycles, potential deferral of revenue due to multiple-element revenue arrangements and alternative licensing arrangements. if any of our assumptions about revenue from our new businesses or our addition of a subscription-based model prove incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected.
if we fail to successfully manage transitions to new business models and markets, our results of operations could suffer.
we often release new offerings and employ new product and service delivery methods in connection with our diversification into new business models and markets. it is uncertain whether these strategies will prove successful or whether we will be able to develop the necessary infrastructure and business models more quickly than our competitors. market acceptance of new product and service offerings will be dependent in part on our ability to (1) include functionality and usability that satisfy customer requirements, and (2) optimally price our products and services in light of marketplace conditions, our costs and customer demand. new product and service offerings may increase our risk of liability related to the provision of services and cause us to incur significant technical, legal or other costs. market acceptance of such services is affected by a variety of factors, including information security, reliability, performance, customer preference, social and community engagement, local government regulations regarding online services and user-generated content, the sufficiency of technological infrastructure to support our products and services in certain geographies, customer concerns with entrusting a third party to store and manage customer data and customer content, consumer concerns regarding data privacy and the enactment of laws or regulations that restrict our ability to provide such services to customers in the united states or internationally. if we are unable to respond to these factors, our business could be harmed.
from time to time we open-source certain of our technology initiatives, provide broader open access to our technology, license certain of our technology on a royalty-free basis or release selected technology for industry standardization. additionally, customer requirements for open standards or open-source products could impact adoption or use of some of our products or services. to the extent we incorrectly predict customer requirements for such products or services, or if there is a delay in market acceptance of such products or services, our business could be harmed.
we also devote significant resources to the development of technologies and service offerings in markets where our operating history is less extensive. these new offerings and markets may require a considerable investment of technical, financial, compliance and sales resources, and a scalable organization. some of our competitors may have advantages over us due to their larger presence, larger developer network, deeper market experience and larger sales, consulting and marketing resources. in addition, the metrics
21
we use to gauge the status of our business model transition may evolve as significant trends emerge. if we are unable to successfully establish new offerings in light of the competitive environment, our results of operations could suffer.
uncertainty about current and future economic conditions and other adverse changes in general political conditions in any of the major countries in which we do business could adversely affect our operating results.
as our business has grown, we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in economic and political conditions, both domestically and globally. uncertainty about the effects of current and future economic and political conditions on us, our customers, suppliers and partners makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments. if economic growth in countries where we do business slows, customers may delay or reduce technology purchases, advertising spending or marketing spending. this could result in reductions in sales of our products and services, more extended sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. our customers include government entities, including the u.s. federal government, and if spending cuts impede the government's ability to purchase our products and services, our revenue could decline. deterioration in economic conditions in any of the countries in which we do business could also cause slower or impaired collections on accounts receivable, which may adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition.
a financial sector credit crisis could impair credit availability and the financial stability of our customers, including our distribution partners and channels. a disruption in the financial markets may also have an effect on our derivative counterparties and could also impair our banking partners, on which we rely for operating cash management. any of these events would likely harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
political instability or adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries in which we do business would also likely harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
certain of our enterprise offerings have extended and complex sales cycles, which can make our sales cycles unpredictable.
sales cycles for some of our enterprise offerings, including our adobe marketing cloud solutions and etlas in our digital media business, are multi-phased and complex. the complexity in these sales cycles is due to a number of factors, including:
•   the need for our sales representatives to educate customers about the use and benefit of our large-scale deployments of our products and services, including technical capabilities, security features, potential cost savings and return on investment;
•   the desire of large and medium size organizations to undertake significant evaluation processes to determine their technology requirements prior to making information technology expenditures;
•   the need for our representatives to spend a significant amount of time assisting potential customers in their testing and evaluation of our products and services;
•   the negotiation of large, complex, enterprise-wide contracts, as often required by our and our customers' business and legal representatives;
•   the need for our customers to obtain requisition approvals from various decision makers within their organizations; and
•   customer budget constraints, economic conditions and unplanned administrative delays.
we spend substantial time and expense on our sales efforts without any assurance that potential customers will ultimately purchase our solutions. as we target our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, these trends are expected to continue and could have a greater impact on our results of operations.  additionally, our enterprise sales pattern has historically been uneven, where a higher percentage of a quarter's total sales occur during the final weeks of each quarter, which is common in our industry.  our extended sales cycle for these products and services makes it difficult to predict when a given sales cycle will close.
security vulnerabilities in our products and systems could lead to reduced revenue or to liability claims.
maintaining the security of our products, computers and networks is a critical issue for us and our customers. security researchers, criminal hackers and other third parties regularly develop new techniques to penetrate computer and network security measures and, as we have previously disclosed, certain parties have in the past managed to breach certain of our data security systems and misused certain of our systems and software in order to access our end users' authentication and payment information. in addition, cyber-attackers also develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs, some of which may be specifically designed to attack our products, systems, computers or networks. sophisticated hardware and operating system
22
applications that we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including bugs and other problems that could unexpectedly compromise the security of the system or impair a customer's ability to operate or use our products. the costs to prevent, eliminate or alleviate cyber- or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities are significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful or may be delayed and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers. it is impossible to predict the extent, frequency or impact these problems may have on us.
outside parties have in the past and may in the future attempt to fraudulently induce our employees or users of our products or services to disclose sensitive information via illegal electronic spamming, phishing or other tactics. unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain physical access to our facilities in order to infiltrate our information systems. these actual and potential breaches of our security measures and the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unauthorized dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive, personal or confidential data about us, our employees, our customers or their end users, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of hacking, fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, could expose us, our employees, our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information. this may result in litigation and liability or fines, governmental inquiry or oversight or a loss of customer confidence, any of which could harm our business or damage our brand and reputation, possibly impeding our present and future success in retaining and attracting new customers and thereby requiring time and resources to repair our brand and reputation.
these problems affect our products and services in particular because cyber-attackers tend to focus their efforts on popular offerings with a large user base, and we expect them to continue to do so. critical vulnerabilities may be identified in certain of our applications. these vulnerabilities could cause such applications to crash and could allow an attacker to take control of the affected system, which could result in liability to us or limit our ability to conduct our business and deliver our products and services to customers. we devote significant resources to address security vulnerabilities through engineering more secure products, enhancing security and reliability features in our products and systems, code hardening, conducting rigorous penetration tests, deploying updates to address security vulnerabilities and improving our incident response time, but these security vulnerabilities cannot be totally eliminated. the cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins, and we may be unable to implement these measures quickly enough to prevent cyber-attackers from gaining unauthorized access into our systems and products. despite our preventative efforts, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and systems may harm our reputation or lead to claims against us (and have in the past led to such claims), and could lead some customers to stop using certain products or services, to reduce or delay future purchases of products or services, or to use competing products or services. if we do not make the appropriate level of investment in our technology systems or if our systems become out-of-date or obsolete and we are not able to deliver the quality of data security customers require, our business could be adversely affected. customers may also adopt security measures designed to protect their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of new technologies. further, if we or our customers are subject to a future attack, or our technology is used in a third-party attack, it may be necessary for us to take additional extraordinary measures and make additional expenditures to take appropriate responsive and preventative steps. any of these events could adversely affect our revenue or margins. moreover, delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers resulting from disruptions caused by cyber-attacks or preventative measures could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.
some of our lines of business rely on us or our third-party service providers to host and deliver services and data, and any interruptions or delays in these hosted services, security or privacy breaches, or failures in data collection could expose us to liability and harm our business and reputation.
some of our lines of business and services, including our online store at adobe.com, creative cloud, document cloud, other hosted digital media offerings and our adobe marketing cloud solutions, rely on hardware and services hosted and controlled directly by us or by our third-party service providers. we do not have redundancy for all of our systems, many of our critical applications reside in only one of our data centers, and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities. if our business relationship with a third-party provider of hosting or content delivery services is negatively affected, or if one of our content delivery suppliers were to terminate its agreement with us, we might not be able to deliver the corresponding hosted offerings to our customers, which could subject us to reputational harm and cause us to lose customers and future business, thereby reducing our revenue.
we hold large amounts of customer data, some of which is hosted in third-party facilities. a security incident at those facilities or ours may compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of customer data. unauthorized access to customer data stored on our computers or networks may be obtained through break-ins, breaches of our secure network by an unauthorized party, employee theft or misuse or other misconduct. it is also possible that unauthorized access to customer data may be obtained through inadequate use of security controls by customers. accounts created with weak passwords could allow cyber-attackers to gain access to customer data. additionally, failure by customers to remove accounts of their own employees, or the granting of accounts by the customer in an uncontrolled manner, may allow for access by former or unauthorized customer representatives. if there were an inadvertent disclosure of customer information, or if a third party were to gain unauthorized access to the information
23
we possess on behalf of our customers, our operations could be disrupted, our reputation could be damaged and we could be subject to claims or other liabilities. in addition, such perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of the information we collect or breach of our security could damage our reputation, result in the loss of customers and harm our business.
because of the large amount of data that our customers collect and manage using our hosted solutions, it is possible that hardware or software failures or errors in our systems (or those of our third-party service providers) could result in data loss or corruption, cause the information that we collect to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our customers regard as significant or cause us to fail to meet committed service levels. furthermore, our ability to collect and report data may be delayed or interrupted by a number of factors, including access to the internet, the failure of our network or software systems, security breaches or significant variability in visitor traffic on customer websites. in addition, computer viruses or other malware may harm our systems, causing us to lose data, and the transmission of computer viruses or other malware could expose us to litigation. we may also find, on occasion, that we cannot deliver data and reports to our customers in near real time because of a number of factors, including significant spikes in customer activity on their websites or failures of our network or software. if we supply inaccurate information or experience interruptions in our ability to capture, store and supply information in near real time or at all, our reputation could be harmed and we could lose customers, or we could be found liable for damages or incur other losses.
changes in accounting principles, or interpretations thereof, could have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations.
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("gaap"). these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles. a change in these principles can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions. additionally, the adoption of new or revised accounting principles may require that we make significant changes to our systems, processes and controls.
for example, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") has issued new accounting standards for revenue recognition and leasing and while we know they will have an impact, we are still evaluating the extent that these new accounting standards will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. changes resulting from these new standards may result in materially different financial results and may require that we change how we process, analyze and report financial information and that we change financial reporting controls. for additional information regarding these updated standards, see the section titled "recent accounting pronouncements not yet effective" within part ii. item 8, note 1. basis of presentation and significant accounting policies."
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, and integration of these acquisitions may disrupt our business and management.
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition of a company, division, product or technology, each of which involves numerous risks. these risks include:
•   difficulty in integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business;
•   difficulty in effectively integrating the acquired technologies, products or services with our current technologies, products or services;
•   difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies during the transition and integration;
•   entry into markets in which we have minimal prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions;
•   disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and other employees from other opportunities and challenges;
•   inability to retain personnel of the acquired business;
•   inability to retain key customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners of the acquired business;
•   inability to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses;
•   inability to take advantage of anticipated tax benefits;
•   incurring acquisition-related costs or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets that could impact our operating results;
24
•   elevated delinquency or bad debt write-offs related to receivables of the acquired business we assume;
•   increased accounts receivables collection times and working capital requirements associated with acquired business models;
•   additional exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates;
•   additional costs of bringing acquired companies into compliance with laws and regulations applicable to us as a multinational corporation;
•   impairment of our relationships with employees, customers, partners, distributors or third-party providers of our technologies, products or services;
•   failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant problems, liabilities or other challenges of an acquired company or technology, including, but not limited to, issues with the acquired company's intellectual property, product quality or product architecture, data back-up and security (including security from cyber-attacks), privacy practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices, employee, customer or partner issues or legal and financial contingencies;
•   exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of, an acquisition, including, but not limited to, claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties;
•   incurring significant exit charges if products or services acquired in business combinations are unsuccessful;
•   inability to conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective;
•   inability to obtain, or obtain in a timely manner, approvals from governmental authorities, which could delay or prevent such acquisitions;
•   the failure of strategic investments to perform as expected or to meet financial projections;
•   delay in customer and distributor purchasing decisions due to uncertainty about the direction of our product and service offerings; and
•   incompatibility of business cultures.
mergers and acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky. if we do not complete an announced acquisition transaction or integrate an acquired business successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition to the extent anticipated, and in certain circumstances an acquisition could harm our financial position.
the success of certain of our product and service offerings depends on our ability to continue to attract and retain customers of and contributors to our online marketplaces for creative content.
the success of certain of our product and service offerings, such as adobe stock, depends on our ability to continue to attract new customers and contributors to these online marketplaces for creative content, as well as our ability to continue to retain existing customers and contributors. to maintain and grow these businesses, we must regularly add new customers and retain existing customers. an increase in paying customers has generally resulted in more content from contributors, which increases the size of our collection and in turn attracts new paying customers. to attract new customers and contributors and retain existing ones, we rely on the functionality and features of our online marketplaces, the size and content of our collection and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. new technologies may render the features of our online marketplaces obsolete, our collection may fail to grow as anticipated or our marketing efforts may be unsuccessful, any of which may adversely affect our results of operations.
we may incur substantial costs enforcing or acquiring intellectual property rights and defending against third-party claims as a result of litigation or other proceedings.
in connection with the enforcement of our intellectual property rights, the acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights, or disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including patent rights, we have been, are currently and may in the future be subject to claims, negotiations and complex, protracted litigation. intellectual property disputes and litigation are typically costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key personnel. we may not prevail in every future lawsuit or dispute. third-party intellectual property disputes, including those initiated by patent assertion entities, could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, prevent us from licensing certain of our products or offering certain of
25
our services, subject us to injunctions restricting our sale of products or services, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete, or require us to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers, including contractual provisions under various license arrangements and service agreements. in addition, we may incur significant costs in acquiring the necessary third-party intellectual property rights for use in our products, in some cases to fulfill contractual obligations with our customers. any of these occurrences could significantly harm our business.
our intellectual property portfolio is a valuable asset and we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights, including our source code, from infringement or unauthorized copying, use or disclosure.
our intellectual property portfolio is a valuable asset. infringement or misappropriation of assets in this portfolio could result in lost revenues and thereby ultimately reduce their value. preventing unauthorized use or infringement of our intellectual property rights is inherently difficult. we actively combat software piracy as we enforce our intellectual property rights, but we nonetheless lose significant revenue due to illegal use of our software. if piracy activities continue at historical levels or increase, they may further harm our business.
if unauthorized disclosure of our source code occurs through security breach, cyber-attack or otherwise, we could lose future trade secret protection for that source code. the loss of future trade secret protection could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could cause us to lose customers and could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. we also seek to protect our confidential information and trade secrets through the use of non-disclosure agreements with our customers, contractors, vendors and partners. however, there is a risk that our confidential information and trade secrets may be disclosed or published without our authorization, and in these situations, enforcing our rights may be difficult or costly.
increasing regulatory focus on privacy issues and expanding laws and regulations could impact our business models and expose us to increased liability.
our industry is highly regulated, including for privacy and data security. we are also expanding our business in countries that have more stringent data protection laws than those in the united states, and such laws may be inconsistent across jurisdictions and are subject to evolving and differing interpretations. governments, privacy advocates and class action attorneys are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit personal data. new laws and industry self-regulatory codes have been enacted and more are being considered that may affect our ability to reach current and prospective customers, to understand how our products and services are being used, to respond to customer requests allowed under the laws, and to implement our business models effectively. any perception of our practices, products or services as an invasion of privacy, whether or not consistent with current regulations and industry practices, may subject us to public criticism, class action lawsuits, reputational harm or claims by regulators, industry groups or other third parties, all of which could disrupt our business and expose us to increased liability. additionally, both laws regulating privacy and third-party products purporting to address privacy concerns could negatively affect the functionality of, and demand for, our products and services, thereby reducing our revenue.
on behalf of certain customers, we collect and store anonymous and personal information derived from the activities of end users with various channels, including traditional websites, mobile websites and applications, email interactions, direct mail, point of sale, text messaging and call centers. federal, state and foreign governments and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws regarding the collection, storage, use and disclosure of this information. our compliance with privacy laws and regulations and our reputation among consumers depend in part on our customers' adherence to privacy laws and regulations and their use of our services in ways consistent with such consumers' expectations. we also rely on contractual representations made to us by customers that their own use of our services and the information they provide to us via our services do not violate any applicable privacy laws, rules and regulations or their own privacy policies. as a component of our standardized customer contract, we obligate customers to provide their consumers the opportunity to "opt out" of the information collection associated with our services, as applicable. we do not formally audit such customers to confirm compliance with these representations. if these representations are false or if our customers do not otherwise comply with applicable privacy laws, we could face adverse publicity and possible legal or other regulatory action. in addition, some countries are considering enacting laws that would expand the scope of privacy-related obligations required of service providers, such as adobe, that would require additional compliance expense and increase our liability risk.
in the past we have relied on the u.s.-european union and the u.s.-swiss safe harbor frameworks, as agreed to by the u.s. department of commerce and the european union ("eu") and switzerland, as a means to legally transfer eu citizens' personal information from the eu to the united states. however, on october 6, 2015, the european court of justice invalidated the u.s.-eu safe harbor framework and the swiss data protection authorities later invalidated the u.s.-swiss safe harbor framework. as a result, we have worked to establish alternate legitimate means of transferring personal data from the european economic area and switzerland to the united states; however, we continue to face uncertainty as to the legitimacy of these alternate means. at least one regulator has determined that, with respect to a small number of vendors that process certain of our eu employee
26
data, we did not implement these alternate means quickly enough, resulting in a fine levied against us. we are closely monitoring developments regarding requirements for transferring personal data outside the eu, such as privacy shield. these requirements may result in an increase in the obligations required of us to provide our services in the eu and in sanctions and fines for non-compliance. these developments could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
failure to manage our sales and distribution channels and third-party customer service and technical support providers effectively could result in a loss of revenue and harm to our business.
we contract with a number of software distributors, none of which is individually responsible for a material amount of our total net revenue for any recent period. nonetheless, if any single agreement with one of our distributors were terminated, any prolonged delay in securing a replacement distributor could have a negative impact on our results of operations.
successfully managing our indirect distribution channel efforts to reach various customer segments for our products and services is a complex process across the broad range of geographies where we do business or plan to do business. our distributors and other channel partners are independent businesses that we do not control. notwithstanding the independence of our channel partners, we face legal risk and potential reputational harm from the activities of these third parties including, but not limited to, export control violations, workplace conditions, corruption and anti-competitive behavior. we cannot be certain that our distribution channel will continue to market or sell our products and services effectively. if our distribution channel is not successful, we may lose sales opportunities, customers and revenue.
our distributors also sell our competitors' products and services, and if they favor our competitors' products or services for any reason, they may fail to market our products or services effectively or to devote resources necessary to provide effective sales, which would cause our results to suffer. we also distribute some products and services through our oem channel, and if our oems decide not to bundle our applications on their devices, our results could suffer.
in addition, the financial health of our distributors and our continuing relationships with them are important to our success. some of these distributors may be unable to withstand adverse changes in economic conditions, which could result in insolvency and/or the inability of such distributors to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and services. in addition, weakness in the end-user market could negatively affect the cash flows of our distributors who could, in turn, delay paying their obligations to us, which would increase our credit risk exposure. our business could be harmed if the financial condition of some of these distributors substantially weakened and we were unable to secure replacement distributors in a timely manner.
we also sell certain of our products and services through our direct sales force. risks associated with this sales channel include more extended sales and collection cycles associated with direct sales efforts, challenges related to hiring, retaining and motivating our direct sales force, and substantial amounts of training for sales representatives, including regular updates to cover new and upgraded systems, products and services. moreover, recent hires may not become as productive as we would like, as in most cases it takes a significant period of time before they achieve full productivity. our business could be seriously harmed if our expansion efforts do not generate a corresponding significant increase in revenue and we are unable to achieve the efficiencies we anticipate. in addition, the loss of key sales employees could impact our customer relationships and future ability to sell to certain accounts covered by such employees.
we also provide products and services, directly and indirectly, to a variety of government entities, both domestically and internationally. risks associated with licensing and selling products and services to government entities include more extended sales and collection cycles, varying governmental budgeting processes and adherence to complex procurement regulations and other government-specific contractual requirements. ineffectively managing these risks could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business, as well as harm to our reputation.
we outsource a substantial portion of our customer service and technical support activities to third-party service providers. we rely heavily on these third-party customer service and technical support representatives working on our behalf, and we expect to continue to rely heavily on third parties in the future. this strategy presents risks to our business due to the fact that we may not be able to influence the quality of support as directly as we would be able to do if our own employees performed these activities. our customers may react negatively to providing information to, and receiving support from, third-party organizations, especially if these third-party organizations are based overseas. if we encounter problems with our third-party customer service and technical support providers, our reputation may be harmed and we could lose customers and associated revenue.
if we are unable to recruit and retain key personnel, our business may be harmed.
much of our future success depends on the continued service, availability and performance of our senior management. these individuals have acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to adobe. the loss of any of these individuals could harm our business, especially in the event that we have not been successful in developing adequate succession plans. our business

is also dependent on our ability to retain, hire and motivate talented, highly skilled personnel across all levels of our organization. experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense in many areas where our employees are located. if we are unable to continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel, our business may be harmed. effective succession planning is also a key factor for our long-term success. our failure to enable the effective transfer of knowledge and facilitate smooth transitions of our key employees could adversely affect our long-term strategic planning and execution.
we believe that a critical contributor to our success to date has been our corporate culture, which we have built to foster innovation, teamwork and employee satisfaction. as we grow, including from the integration of employees and businesses acquired in connection with previous or future acquisitions, we may find it difficult to maintain important aspects of our corporate culture, which could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel who are essential to our future success.
changes in tax rules and regulations, or interpretations thereof, may adversely affect our effective tax rates.
we are a u.s.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple u.s. and foreign tax jurisdictions. a significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our irish subsidiaries. in addition to providing for u.s. income taxes on earnings from the united states, we provide for u.s. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries' earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the united states. while we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related u.s. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings.
our income tax expense has differed from the tax computed at the u.s. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to discrete items and to earnings considered as permanently reinvested in foreign operations. unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations. our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, by changes in or our interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, by unanticipated decreases in the amount of earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. the united states, the european commission, countries in the eu and other countries where we do business have been considering changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as adobe. these potential changes could adversely affect our effective tax rates or result in other costs to us.
in addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the u.s. internal revenue service ("irs") and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. these tax examinations are expected to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters. we regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for adjustments that may result from the current examinations. we cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.
we may incur losses associated with currency fluctuations and may not be able to effectively hedge our exposure.
because our products are distributed and used globally, our operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. we attempt to mitigate a portion of these risks through foreign currency hedging, based on our judgment of the appropriate trade-offs among risk, opportunity and expense. we have established a program to partially hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for various currencies and we regularly review this hedging program and make adjustments as necessary based on the factors discussed above. our hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.
if we fail to process transactions effectively, our revenue and earnings may be harmed.
we process a significant volume of transactions on a daily basis in our digital marketing and digital media businesses. due to the size and volume of transactions that we handle, effective processing systems and controls are essential, but even the most sophisticated systems and controls may not be effective in preventing all errors. the systems supporting our business are comprised of multiple technology platforms that may be difficult to scale. if we are unable to effectively manage these systems and processes, we may be unable to process customer data in an accurate, reliable and timely manner, which may harm our customer relationships or results of operations.
28
net revenue, margin or earnings shortfalls or the volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to decline.
the market price for our common stock has in the past experienced significant fluctuations and may do so in the future. a number of factors may affect the market price for our common stock, including:
•   shortfalls in our revenue, margins, earnings, annualized recurring revenue ("arr"), bookings within our adobe marketing cloud business or other key performance metrics;
•   changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;
•   whether our results meet analysts' expectations;
•   compression or expansion of multiples used by investors and analysts to value high technology saas companies;
•   the announcement of new products or services, product enhancements or service introductions by us or our competitors;
•   the loss of large customers or our inability to increase sales to existing customers, retain customers or attract new customers;
•   variations in our or our competitors' results of operations, changes in the competitive landscape generally and developments in our industry; and
•   unusual events such as significant acquisitions, divestitures, litigation, general socio-economic, regulatory, political or market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance.
in addition, the technology industry as a whole may experience uneven investor confidence, which may cause the market price for our common stock to decline for reasons unrelated to our operating performance.
we are subject to risks associated with compliance with laws and regulations globally which may harm our business.
we are a global company subject to varied and complex laws, regulations and customs, both domestically and internationally. these laws and regulations relate to a number of aspects of our business, including trade protection, import and export control, data and transaction processing security, payment card industry data security standards, records management, user-generated content hosted on websites we operate, privacy practices, data residency, corporate governance, anti-trust and competition, employee and third-party complaints, anti-corruption, gift policies, conflicts of interest, employment and labor relations laws, securities regulations and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. the application of these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear and may at times conflict. compliance with these laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in our business practices that result in reduced revenue and profitability. non-compliance could also result in fines, damages, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. we incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our global operations and could become subject to legal penalties if we fail to comply with local laws and regulations in u.s. jurisdictions or in foreign countries, which laws and regulations may be substantially different from those in the united states. in many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by u.s. regulations applicable to us, including the foreign corrupt practices act. we cannot provide assurance that all of our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such u.s. laws may be customary, will not take actions in violation of our internal policies or u.s. laws and regulations. any such violation could have an adverse effect on our business.
we face various risks associated with our operating as a multinational corporation.
as a global business that generates approximately 42% of our total revenue from sales to customers outside of the americas, we are subject to a number of risks, including:
•   foreign currency fluctuations;
•   changes in government preferences for software procurement;
•   international and regional economic, political and labor conditions, including any instability or security concerns abroad;
•   tax laws (including u.s. taxes on foreign subsidiaries);
•   increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;
29
•   unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements;
•   changes in laws governing the free flow of data across international borders;
•   failure of laws to protect our intellectual property rights adequately;
•   inadequate local infrastructure and difficulties in managing and staffing international operations;
•   delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology, tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers;
•   the imposition of governmental economic sanctions on countries in which we do business or where we plan to expand our business;
•   costs and delays associated with developing products in multiple languages;
•   operating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices; and
•   other factors beyond our control, including terrorism, war, natural disasters and pandemics.
if sales to any of our customers outside of the americas are reduced, delayed or canceled because of any of the above factors, our revenue may decline.
in addition, approximately 53% of our employees are located outside the united states. accordingly, we are exposed to changes in laws governing our employee relationships in various u.s. and foreign jurisdictions, including laws and regulations regarding wage and hour requirements, fair labor standards, employee data privacy, unemployment tax rates, workers' compensation rates, citizenship requirements and payroll and other taxes, which likely would have a direct impact on our operating costs. we may continue to expand our international operations and international sales and marketing activities. expansion in international markets has required, and will continue to require, significant management attention and resources. we may be unable to scale our infrastructure effectively or as quickly as our competitors in these markets, and our revenue may not increase to offset these expected increases in costs and operating expenses, which would cause our results to suffer.
we have issued $1.9 billion of notes in debt offerings and may incur other debt in the future, which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results.
we have $1.9 billion in senior unsecured notes outstanding. we also have a $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement, which is currently undrawn. this debt may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by, among other things:
•   requiring the dedication of a portion of our expected cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions; and
•   limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry.
our senior unsecured notes and senior unsecured revolving credit agreement impose restrictions on us and require us to maintain compliance with specified covenants. our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or noteholders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable.
in addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities, as well as the potential costs associated with a refinancing of our debt. under certain circumstances, if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit facility could increase. downgrades in our credit ratings could also affect the terms of any such financing and restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.
if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, then we could be required to record a significant charge to earnings.
under gaap, we review our goodwill and amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. gaap requires us to test for goodwill impairment at least annually. factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include declines in stock price, market capitalization or cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry. we could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period
30
in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets were determined, negatively impacting our results of operations.
catastrophic events may disrupt our business.
we are a highly automated business and rely on our network infrastructure and enterprise applications, internal technology systems and our website for our development, marketing, operational, support, hosted services and sales activities. in addition, some of our businesses rely on third-party hosted services, and we do not control the operation of third-party data center facilities serving our customers from around the world, which increases our vulnerability. a disruption, infiltration or failure of these systems or third-party hosted services in the event of a major earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami or other weather event, power loss, telecommunications failure, software or hardware malfunctions, cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event that our disaster recovery plans could not adequately address, could cause system interruptions, reputational harm, loss of intellectual property, delays in our product development, lengthy interruptions in our services, breaches of data security and loss of critical data. any of these events could prevent us from fulfilling our customers' orders or could negatively impact a country or region in which we sell our products, which could in turn decrease that country's or region's demand for our products. our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, certain of our data centers and certain other critical business operations are located in the san francisco bay area, and additional facilities where we conduct significant operations are located in the salt lake valley area, both of which are near major earthquake faults. a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be adversely affected.
climate change may have a long-term impact on our business.
access to clean water and reliable energy in the communities where we conduct our business, whether for our offices or for our vendors, is a priority.  our major sites in california and india are vulnerable to prolonged droughts due to climate change. while we seek to partner with organizations that mitigate their business risks associated with climate change, we recognize that there are inherent risks wherever business is conducted.  in the event of a natural disaster that disrupts business due to limited access to these resources, adobe has the potential to experience losses to our business, time required to recover, and added costs to resume operations.
additionally, climate change may pose regulatory and environmental challenges that affect where we locate our offices, who we partner with, and how we deliver products and services to our customers.
our investment portfolio may become impaired by deterioration of the financial markets.
our cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio as of december 2, 2016 consisted of corporate bonds and commercial paper, u.s. agency securities and u.s. treasury securities, money market mutual funds, municipal securities, time deposits and asset-backed securities. we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk. the policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer, as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes.
should financial market conditions worsen in the future, investments in some financial instruments may pose risks arising from market liquidity and credit concerns. in addition, any deterioration of the capital markets could cause our other income and expense to vary from expectations. as of december 2, 2016, we had no material impairment charges associated with our short-term investment portfolio, and although we believe our current investment portfolio has little risk of material impairment, we cannot predict future market conditions, market liquidity or credit availability, and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired.
item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.
acquisitions during fiscal 2015, we completed our acquisition of privately held fotolia, a leading marketplace for royalty-free photos, images, graphics and hd videos, for $807.5 million. during fiscal 2015, we integrated fotolia into our digital media reportable segment.
we also completed other immaterial business acquisitions during the fiscal years presented. pro forma information has not been presented for any of our fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 acquisitions as the impact to our consolidated financial statements was not material.
subsequent to december 2, 2016, we completed our acquisition of tubemogul, a publicly held video advertising platform company, for approximately $549 million in cash consideration, as well as the assumption of certain employee equity awards. the initial purchase accounting for this transaction has not yet been completed given the short period of time between the acquisition date and the issuance of these financial statements. tubemogul will be integrated into our digital marketing reportable segment for financial reporting purposes in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
see note 2 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these acquisitions.
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the sec, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. we base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. on a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates. we also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors.
we believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, business combinations, goodwill impairment and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. these areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.
revenue recognition our revenue is derived from the subscription, non-software related hosted services, perpetual and term-based licensing of software products, associated software maintenance and support plans, consulting services, training and technical support. most of our enterprise customer arrangements are complex, involving multiple solutions and various license rights, bundled with post-contract customer support and other meaningful rights that together provide a complete end-to-end solution to the customer. throughout the contract period, customers use our solutions to complete various phases of the creative and/or marketing processes allowing them to concurrently work on multiple projects. in response to evolving customer and market expectations, we frequently expand and improve our technology to keep up with the pace of change, to provide enhancements to our tools to meet industry needs and to provide support at each stage of the customer's life cycle.
we recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report.
we enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of software, upgrades, maintenance and support, hosted services and consulting.
for our software and software-related multiple element arrangements, we must: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services; (3) determine the fair value of each undelivered element using vendor-specific objective evidence ("vsoe"); and (4) allocate the total price among the various elements. vsoe of fair value is used to allocate a portion of the price to the undelivered elements and the residual method is used to allocate the remaining portion to the delivered elements. absent vsoe,
37
revenue is deferred until the earlier of the point at which vsoe of fair value exists for any undelivered element or until all elements of the arrangement have been delivered. however, if the only undelivered element is maintenance and support, the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period.
we determine vsoe for each element based on historical stand-alone sales to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the elements contained in the initial arrangement. in determining vsoe, we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range.
we have established vsoe for our software maintenance and support services, custom software development services, consulting services and training, when such services are sold optionally with software licenses.
for multiple-element arrangements containing our non-software services, we must: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of vsoe of selling price, third-party evidence ("tpe") of selling price or best-estimated selling price ("besp"), as applicable; and (3) allocate the total price among the various elements based on the relative selling price method.
for multiple-element arrangements that contain both software and non-software elements, we allocate revenue to software or software-related elements as a group and any non-software elements separately based on the selling price hierarchy. we determine the selling price for each deliverable using vsoe of selling price, if it exists, or tpe of selling price. if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exist for a deliverable, we use besp. once revenue is allocated to software or software-related elements as a group, we recognize revenue in conformance with software revenue accounting guidance. revenue is recognized when revenue recognition criteria are met for each element.
we are generally unable to establish vsoe or tpe for non-software elements and as such, we use besp. besp is generally used for offerings that are not typically sold on a stand-alone basis or for new or highly customized offerings. we determine besp for a product or service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, major product groupings, geographies, market conditions, competitive landscape, internal costs, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. pricing practices taken into consideration include historic contractually stated prices, volume discounts where applicable and our price lists. we must estimate certain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers. while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. accordingly, our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenue could differ from actual events, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.
product revenue is recognized when the above criteria are met. we reduce the revenue recognized for estimated future returns, rebates and price protection at the time the related revenue is recorded. in determining our estimate for returns and in accordance with our internal policy regarding global channel inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by our distributors on which we have recognized revenue, we rely upon historical data, the estimated amount of product inventory in our distribution channel, the rate at which our product sells through to the end user, product plans and other factors. our estimated provisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs. product returns may be more or less than what was estimated. the amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated. our estimate of the rate of sell-through for product in the channel could be different than what actually occurs. these factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual returns, thus impacting our financial position and results of operations.
in the future, actual returns and price protection may exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences, market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms, product updates or competing products. while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. accordingly, if our estimates change, our returns and price protection reserves would change, which would impact the total net revenue we report.
we recognize revenue for hosted services that are priced based on a committed number of transactions ratably beginning on the date the services associated with the committed transactions are first made available to the customer and continuing through the end of the contractual service term. over-usage fees, and fees billed based on the actual number of transactions from which we capture data, are billed in accordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred. we record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met.
our consulting revenue is recognized on a time and materials basis and is measured monthly based on input measures, such as on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable.
38
business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, assumed equity awards, as well as to in-process research and development based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. the purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets, deferred revenue obligations and equity assumed.
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to:
•   future expected cash flows from software license sales, subscriptions, support agreements, consulting contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;
•   expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed;
•   the acquired company's trade name and trademarks as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademarks will continue to be used in the combined company's product portfolio; and
•   discount rates.
in connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the deferred revenue obligations assumed. the estimated fair value of the support obligations is determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. the cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. the estimated costs to fulfill the obligations are based on the historical costs related to fulfilling the obligations.
in connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the equity awards assumed. the estimated fair value is determined utilizing a modified binomial option pricing model which assumes employees exercise their stock options when the share price exceeds the strike price by a certain dollar threshold. if the acquired company has significant historical data on their employee's exercise behavior, then this threshold is determined based upon the acquired company's history. otherwise, our historical exercise experience is used to determine the exercise threshold. zero coupon yields implied by u.s. treasury issuances, implied volatility for our common stock and our historical forfeiture rate are other inputs to the binomial model.
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.
goodwill impairment we complete our goodwill impairment test on an annual basis, during the second quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently, if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that an impairment in the value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may exist. as part of our annual goodwill impairment test, we first evaluate goodwill to determine if it is more likely than not that the occurrence of an event or change in circumstances has reduced the fair value of a reporting segment below its carrying value. this qualitative assessment requires that we consider events or circumstances that may include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, changes in management or key personnel, changes in strategy and changes in customers.
if the qualitative assessment indicates that the two-step quantitative analysis should be performed, we exercise judgment at various steps, including the identification of reporting segments, assignment of goodwill to reporting segments, and determination of the fair value of each reporting segment. in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill, we typically estimate future revenue, consider market factors and estimate our future cash flows. based on these key assumptions, judgments and estimates, we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair value. assumptions, judgments and estimates about future values are complex and often subjective. they can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts. although we believe the assumptions, judgments and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions, judgments and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results.
39
we completed our annual impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and determined there was no impairment. the results of our annual impairment test indicate that the fair values of our reporting units are significantly in excess of their carrying values.
accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. in addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset.
our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. we have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. in addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. we expect future examinations to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters. we regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from such examinations. we believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, the final determination of any of these examinations could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.
our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income, such as income from operations or capital gains income. actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate. any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.
we are a united states-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple u.s. and foreign tax jurisdictions. a significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our irish subsidiaries. in addition to providing for u.s. income taxes on earnings from the united states, we provide for u.s. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries' earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the united states. while we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related u.s. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings.
our income tax expense has differed from the tax computed at the u.s. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to discrete items and to earnings considered as permanently reinvested in foreign operations. unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations. our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, by changes in, or our interpretation of, tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, by unanticipated decreases in the amount of earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. the united states, countries in the european union and other countries where we do business have been considering changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as adobe. these potential changes could adversely affect our effective tax rates or result in other costs to us.
recent accounting pronouncements see note 1 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements that are of significance, or potential significance to us.
results of operations overview of 2016
for fiscal 2016, we reported strong financial results consistent with the continued execution of our long-term plans for our two strategic growth areas, digital media and digital marketing, while continuing to market and license a broad portfolio of products and solutions.
in our digital media segment, we are a market leader with adobe creative cloud, our subscription-based offering for creating and publishing content and applications. creative cloud delivers value through frequent product updates, storage and access to user files stored in the cloud with syncing of files across users' machines, access to marketplace, social and community-
40
based features with our adobe stock and behance services, app creation capabilities and affordable point pricing for cost-sensitive customers.
we offer creative cloud for individuals, students, teams and enterprises. these creative cloud offerings address the multiple routes to market we use to license our creative software to targeted customers. adoption of creative cloud has transformed our business model, and we continue to expect this to drive higher long-term revenue growth through an expansion of our customer base by acquiring new users through a lower cost of entry and delivery of additional features and value, as well as keeping existing customers current on our latest release. we have also built out a marketplace for creative cloud subscribers to enable the delivery and purchase of stock content in our adobe stock service. overall, our strategy with creative cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with users, attract more new customers, and grow a recurring and predictable revenue stream that is recognized ratably.
we continue to implement strategies that will accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of subscriptions to our creative cloud offerings. these strategies include increasing the value creative cloud users receive, such as offering new mobile applications, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract past customers and potential users to try out and ultimately subscribe to creative cloud. because of the shift towards creative cloud subscriptions and enterprise term license agreements ("etlas"), revenue from perpetual licensing of our creative products is now immaterial to our business.
we are also a market leader with our adobe document cloud offerings built around our acrobat family of products, the adobe reader and a set of integrated cloud-based document services, including adobe sign. adobe acrobat provides reliable creation and exchange of electronic documents, regardless of platform or application source type. adobe document cloud, which we believe enhances the way people manage critical documents at home, in the office and across devices, includes adobe acrobat dc and adobe sign, and a set of integrated services enables users to create, review, approve, sign and track documents whether on a desktop or mobile device. adobe acrobat dc, with a touch-enabled user interface, is offered both through subscription and perpetual licenses.
annualized recurring revenue ("arr") is currently the key performance metric our management uses to assess the health and trajectory of our overall digital media segment. arr should be viewed independently of revenue, deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue as arr is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. we adjust our reported arr on an annual basis to reflect any material exchange rates changes. our reported arr results in fiscal 2016 are based on currency rates set at the start of fiscal 2016 and held constant throughout the year. we calculate arr as follows:
creative arr         annual value of creative cloud subscriptions and services+ annual digital publishing suite contract value + annual creative etla contract value document cloud arr   annual value of document cloud subscriptions and services +annual document cloud etla contract value digital media arr    creative arr+ document cloud arr creative arr exiting fiscal 2016 was $3.54 billion, up from $2.50 billion at the end of fiscal 2015. document cloud arr exiting fiscal 2016 was $475 million, up from $385 million at the end of fiscal 2015. total digital media arr grew to $4.01 billion at the end of fiscal 2016, up from $2.88 billion at the end of fiscal 2015. revaluing our ending arr for fiscal 2016 using currency rates at the beginning of fiscal 2017, our digital media arr at the end of fiscal 2016 would be $3.99 billion or approximately $27 million lower than the arr reported above.
our success in driving growth in arr has positively affected our revenue growth. creative revenue in fiscal 2016 was $3.18 billion, up from $2.30 billion in fiscal 2015 and representing 38% year-over-year growth. document cloud revenue in fiscal 2016 was $764.9 million, slightly down from $792.3 million in fiscal 2015 as we continue to transition document cloud to a subscription-based model. total digital media segment revenue grew to $3.94 billion in fiscal 2016, up from $3.10 billion in fiscal 2015 and representing 27% year-over-year growth.

fiscal 2016 revenue compared to fiscal 2015 revenue digital media revenue from digital media increased $845.8 million during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily driven by increases in revenue associated with our creative offerings.
revenue associated with our creative offerings, which includes our creative cloud, perpetual creative and stock photography offerings, increased during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to the increase in subscription revenue associated with our creative cloud offerings driven by increases in the number of paid creative cloud individual and team subscriptions, and continued adoption of our etlas. to a lesser extent, increases in revenue associated with our creative cloud photography plan subscription offering and stock photography offerings also contributed to the increase in revenue associated with our creative offerings. increases associated with our creative offerings were slightly offset by expected declines in revenue associated with our perpetual creative offerings and distribution of third-party software downloads.
document cloud revenue, which includes our acrobat product family, decreased slightly during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to expected decreases in revenue associated with our acrobat perpetual license offering. decreases were partially offset by increases in revenue associated with our document cloud subscription offerings as we continue to migrate more customers to our document cloud, along with increases in adobe sign revenue.
digital marketing revenue from digital marketing increased $227.7 million during fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to continued revenue growth associated with our adobe marketing cloud, which increased 20% year over year. increases in adobe marketing cloud revenue were largely driven by the continued adoption of our aem offerings and, to a lesser extent, increases in revenue associated with adobe analytics and adobe campaign.
fiscal 2015 revenue compared to fiscal 2014 revenue digital media revenue from digital media increased $492.0 million during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily driven by increases in revenue associated with our creative offerings due to the strong adoption of creative cloud. document cloud revenue remained stable during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014.
creative revenue, which includes our creative cloud and perpetual creative offerings, increased during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to the increase in subscription revenue associated with our creative cloud offerings driven by the increase in the number of paid creative cloud team, individual and enterprise subscriptions. increases associated with our creative products were offset in part by expected declines in revenue associated with our perpetual creative offerings.
document cloud revenue, which includes our acrobat product family, remained stable during fiscal 2015 as compared to the year ago period, as increases in revenue associated with adobe sign and our document cloud subscription offerings were offset by decreases in revenue associated with our acrobat perpetual license offerings. driving the increase in our document cloud subscription revenue was the adoption of our cloud offering through subscriptions and etlas.

digital marketing revenue from digital marketing increased $153.7 million during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to continued revenue growth associated with our adobe marketing cloud, which increased 16% as compared to fiscal 2014. contributing to this increase was the continued adoption of our aem term-based offering, and to a lesser extent, increases in revenue associated with adobe campaign, adobe analytics and adobe target.

see note 17 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further geographic information.
backlog deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet consists of billings and payments received in advance of revenue recognition for our products and solutions and does not represent the total contract value of existing annual or multi-year, non-cancelable commercial subscription, saas and managed services agreements or government contracts with fiscal funding clauses. unbilled deferred revenue represents expected future billings which are contractually committed under our existing subscription, saas and managed services agreements that have not been invoiced and are not recorded in deferred revenue within our financial statements. our presentation of unbilled deferred revenue backlog may differ from that of other companies in the industry. as of december 2, 2016, we had unbilled deferred revenue backlog of approximately $3.4 billion of which approximately 40% to 50% is not reasonably expected to be billed during fiscal 2017. comparatively, we had unbilled deferred revenue backlog of approximately $2.9 billion as of november 27, 2015, of which approximately 40% to 50% was not reasonably expected to be billed during fiscal 2016.
we expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue backlog will change from period to period due to certain factors, including the timing and duration of large customer subscriptions, saas and managed service agreements, varying billing cycles of these agreements, the timing of customer renewals, the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue backlog is to be billed, changes in customer financial circumstances and foreign currency fluctuations. additionally, the unbilled deferred revenue backlog for multi-year subscription agreements that are billed annually is typically higher at the beginning of the contract period, lower prior to renewal and typically increases when the agreement is renewed. accordingly, fluctuations in unbilled deferred revenue backlog may not be a reliable indicator of future business prospects and the related revenue associated with these contractual commitments.

amortization of purchased intangibles during the last several years, we have completed a number of business combinations and asset acquisitions. as a result of these acquisitions, we purchased intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to fourteen years.
amortization expense increased during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to write-off of certain acquired intangible assets from a previous acquisition and the increase in amortization expense associated with intangible assets purchased in fiscal 2016.
amortization expense increased during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to amortization expense associated with intangible assets purchased through our acquisition of fotolia in fiscal 2015, partially offset by the decrease in amortization expense associated with certain intangible assets purchased through our acquisition of efficient frontier and day software holding ag that were fully amortized at the end of fiscal 2014.

interest and other income (expense), net interest and other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term fixed income investments. interest and other income (expense), net also includes gains and losses on fixed income investments and foreign exchange gains and losses other than any gains recorded to revenue from our hedging programs.
interest and other income (expense), net decreased in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 due to the gain on the sale of certain property assets that occurred in fiscal 2015 and the increase in foreign exchange hedging costs, offset by the increase in interest income due to increased average investment balance and interest rates.
interest and other income (expense), net increased in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to the gain on the sale of certain property assets and, to a lesser extent, an increased average investment balance and average interest rate. see note 6 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further details regarding the sale of our property assets.
interest expense interest expense primarily represents interest associated with our senior notes and interest rate swaps. interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on february 1 and august 1. floating interest payments on the interest rate swaps are paid monthly. the fixed-rate interest receivable on the swaps is received semi-annually concurrent with the senior notes interest payments.  see notes 5 and 15 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further details regarding our interest rate swaps.
interest expense increased during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to the increase in floating rate on interest rate swap and higher average debt balances.
interest expense increased during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to the increase in total debt, partially offset by the favorable impact of the interest rate swaps.
investment gains (losses), net investment gains (losses), net consists principally of realized gains or losses from the sale of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities and unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets (classified as trading securities) and gains and losses associated with our direct and indirect investments in privately held companies.

our effective tax rate decreased by approximately nine percentage points during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. the decrease was primarily due to tax benefits recognized as a result of the completion of certain income tax examinations and the permanent extension of the u.s. research and development credit for 2015 and onward. the reinstatement of the credit was retroactive to january 1, 2015. a tax benefit for the credit relating to fiscal 2015 was reflected in its entirety in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. the decrease was partially offset by stronger domestic profits for fiscal 2016. in addition, the fiscal 2015 effective tax rate included one-time tax costs associated with licensing acquired company assets to adobe's trading companies, offset by tax benefits for the temporary reinstatement of the u.s. research and development credit in december 2014.
our effective tax rate increased by approximately two percentage points during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. the increase was primarily due to tax costs associated with licensing acquired company assets to adobe's trading companies. the increase was partially offset by tax benefits related to the reinstatement of the federal research and development tax credit in december 2014. the reinstatement of the credit was retroactive to january 1, 2014.
we are a united states-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple u.s. and foreign tax jurisdictions. a significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year was earned by our irish subsidiaries. in addition to providing for u.s. income taxes on earnings from the united states, we provide for u.s. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries' earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the united states. while we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related u.s. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings. currently, there is a significant amount of foreign earnings upon which u.s. income taxes have not been provided. see note 9 of our notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our provision for income taxes.
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at december 2, 2016 was $178.4 million, exclusive of interest and penalties. if the total unrecognized tax benefits at december 2, 2016 were recognized in the future, $144.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits would decrease the effective tax rate, which is net of an estimated $33.9 million federal benefit related to deducting certain payments on future federal and state tax returns.
as of december 2, 2016, the combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns was approximately $22.4 million. this amount is included in non-current income taxes payable.
the timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. these events could cause large fluctuations in the balance of current and non-current assets, liabilities and income taxes payable. we believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. given the uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to approximately $10 million.
during fiscal 2016, a number of income tax examinations covering our fiscal years 2010 to 2016 were completed. of the significant examinations, accrued tax and interest related to these years were $95.6 million and were previously reported in non-current income taxes payable. we settled the tax obligation resulting from these examinations with cash and income tax assets totaling $35.3 million, and the resulting $60.3 million income tax benefit was recorded in fiscal 2016.

our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue. the primary uses of cash are payroll related expenses, general operating expenses including marketing, travel and office rent, and cost of revenue. other sources of cash are proceeds from participation in the employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of employee options. other uses of cash include our stock repurchase program, which is described below, business acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment.
cash flows from operating activities for fiscal 2016, net cash provided by operating activities of $2.20 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. the primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue and accrued expenses. the increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased subscriptions for our creative cloud offerings and increases in digital marketing hosted services. the increase in accrued expenses is primarily due to the increase in accruals for compensation costs and employee benefits driven by the increase in headcount. the primary working capital uses of cash were increases in trade receivables, prepaid expenses and other current assets, and a decrease in income taxes payable. trade receivables increased primarily due to higher revenue levels. prepaid expenses and other current assets increased primarily due to advanced tax payments made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. income taxes payable decreased primarily due to the completion of certain income tax audits in fiscal 2016, offset in part by increases to the tax provision in excess of taxes paid.
for fiscal 2015, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.47 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. the primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue, income taxes payable and trade payables. the increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased subscriptions for our team, individual and enterprise creative cloud offerings and increases in digital marketing hosted services. the increase in income taxes payable was primarily due to higher taxable income levels during fiscal 2015. trade payables increased primarily due to the timing of payments to web services vendors as certain invoices were received in the final weeks of fiscal 2015. the primary working capital uses of cash were increases in trade receivables which were principally due to higher revenue levels.
for fiscal 2014, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.29 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. the primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue and accrued expenses. the increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased subscription and etla activity for our individual, team and enterprise creative cloud offerings and increases in digital marketing and digital publishing hosted services, offset in part by decreases in billings for our maintenance and creative product software upgrade plans which we discontinued in january 2013. accrued expenses increased primarily due to accruals for contract terminations and employee transition payments associated with business realignment initiatives implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.
53
cash flows from investing activities for fiscal 2016, net cash used for investing activities of $960.0 million was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments. other uses of cash represented purchases of property and equipment, purchases of long-term investments and other assets, and an immaterial acquisition. these cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments.
for fiscal 2015, net cash used for investing activities of $1.49 billion was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments and our acquisition of fotolia. other uses of cash during fiscal 2015 represented purchases of property and equipment, and long-term investments and other assets. these cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments and proceeds received from the sale of certain property assets. see note 2 and note 6 of our consolidated financial statements for more detailed information regarding our acquisition of fotolia and sale of property assets, respectively.
for fiscal 2014, net cash used for investing activities of $490.7 million was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments, purchases of property and equipment and a business acquisition. these cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments.
cash flows from financing activities for fiscal 2016, net cash used for financing activities of $1.09 billion was primarily due to payments for our treasury stock repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
in january 2015, we issued $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due february 1, 2025 (the "2025 notes"). our proceeds were approximately $989.3 million which is net of an issuance discount of $10.7 million. in addition, we incurred issuance costs of $7.9 million. both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2025 notes using the effective interest method. the 2025 notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
we used $600 million of the proceeds from the 2025 notes offering to repay the outstanding balance plus accrued and unpaid interest of the $600 million 3.25% senior notes due february 1, 2015 ("2015 notes"). the remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.  see note 15 of our consolidated financial statements for more detailed information.
in addition to the 2025 notes issuance and 2015 notes repayment, other financing activities during fiscal 2015 also include payments for our treasury stock repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
for fiscal 2014, net cash used for financing activities of $507.3 million was primarily due to payments for our treasury stock repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
see the section titled "stock repurchase program" discussed below.
we expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments, venture capital, facilities expansion and purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and administrative staff. furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to strategically acquire companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business.
other liquidity and capital resources considerations our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may fluctuate during fiscal 2017 due to changes in our planned cash outlay, including changes in incremental costs such as direct and integration costs related to our acquisitions. our cash and investments totaled $4.76 billion as of december 2, 2016. of this amount, approximately 83% was held by our foreign subsidiaries and subject to material repatriation tax effects. our intent is to permanently reinvest a significant portion of our earnings from foreign operations, and current plans do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations. in the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the united states and if u.s. tax has not already been previously provided, we would provide for and pay additional u.s. taxes in connection with repatriating these funds.
54
cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed in part i, item 1a titled "risk factors." however, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months.
on march 2, 2012, we entered into a five-year $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (the "credit agreement"), providing for loans to us and certain of our subsidiaries. on march 1, 2013, we exercised our option under the credit agreement to extend the maturity date of the credit agreement by one year to march 2, 2018. on july 27, 2015, we entered into an amendment to further extend the maturity date of the credit agreement to july 27, 2020 and reallocated the facility among the syndicate of lenders that are parties to the credit agreement. as of december 2, 2016, there were no outstanding borrowings under this credit agreement and the entire $1 billion credit line remains available for borrowing.
as of december 2, 2016, the amount outstanding under our senior notes was $1.9 billion, consisting of $900 million of 4.75% senior notes due february 1, 2020 (the "2020 notes") and $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due february 1, 2025 (together with the 2020 notes, the "notes").
subsequent to december 2, 2016, we completed our acquisition of tubemogul, a publicly held video advertising platform company, for approximately $549 million in cash consideration, as well as the assumption of certain employee equity awards. see note 2 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this acquisition.
our short-term investment portfolio is primarily invested in corporate bonds and commercial paper, u.s. agency securities and u.s. treasury securities, foreign government securities, municipal securities and asset-backed securities.we use professional investment management firms to manage a large portion of our invested cash. external investment firms managed, on average, 61% of our consolidated invested balances during fiscal 2016.
stock repurchase program to facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, we may repurchase shares in the open market or enter into structured repurchase agreements with third parties. in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, the board of directors approved our stock repurchase program granting us authority to repurchase up to $2 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2017.
during fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $1.08 billion, $625 million and $600 million, respectively. the prepayments of $1.08 billion made during fiscal 2016 were under the current $2 billion authority. of the prepayments of $625 million made during fiscal 2015, $425 million were under the current $2 billion authority and $200 million were under the previous $2 billion authority. the prepayments of $600 million made during fiscal 2014 were under the previous $2 billion authority. we enter into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the volume weighted average price ("vwap") of our common stock over a specified period of time. we only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is higher than the expected foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. there were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us.
the financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. the parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the contract, the number of trading days in the interval and the average vwap of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount. during fiscal 2016, we repurchased approximately 10.4 million shares at an average price of $97.16 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015. during fiscal 2015, we repurchased approximately 8.1 million shares at an average price of $77.38 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014. during fiscal 2014, we repurchased approximately 10.9 million shares at an average price per share of $63.48 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013.
for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our consolidated balance sheets at the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by december 2, 2016, november 27, 2015 and november 28, 2014 were excluded from the computation of earnings per share. as of december 2, 2016, $100.1 million of prepayments remained under the agreement.
subsequent to december 2, 2016, as part of our current $2 billion stock repurchase program, we entered into a structured stock repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $200 million. this amount will be classified as treasury stock on our consolidated balance sheets. upon completion of the $200 million stock repurchase agreement, $300 million remains under our current authority.
55
subsequent to december 2, 2016, the board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program granting us authority to repurchase up to $2.5 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2019. the new stock repurchase program approved by our board of directors is similar to our previous stock repurchase programs.
see item 5, market for registrant's common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities for share repurchases during the quarter ended december 2, 2016.

off-balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations our principal commitments as of december 2, 2016 consist of obligations under operating leases, royalty agreements and various service agreements. see note 14 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our contractual commitments.
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 2, 2016 (in millions):

senior notes as of december 2, 2016, our outstanding notes payable consists of the 2020 notes and 2025 notes with a total carrying value of $1.90 billion. interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears on february 1 and august 1. at december 2, 2016, our maximum commitment for interest payments under the notes was $425.9 million for the remaining duration of our notes. in june 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps that effectively converted the fixed interest rate on our 2020 notes to a floating interest rate based on the london interbank offered rate ("libor") plus a fixed number of basis points through february 1, 2020.
covenants our credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio. our almaden tower lease includes certain financial ratios as defined in the lease agreement that are reported to the lessor quarterly. as of december 2, 2016, we were in compliance with all of our covenants. we believe these covenants will not impact our credit or cash in the coming fiscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. our notes do not contain any financial covenants.
under the terms of our credit agreement and lease agreements, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or one currently exists. we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
56
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at december 2, 2016 was $178.4 million, exclusive of interest and penalties.
the timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. these events could cause large fluctuations in the balance of current and non-current assets, liabilities and income taxes payable. we believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. given the uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to approximately $10 million.
royalties we have certain royalty commitments associated with the licensing of certain products. royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit, or a percentage of the underlying revenue.
indemnifications in the normal course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations.
to the extent permitted under delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is or was serving at our request in such capacity. the indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the director's or officer's lifetime. the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.

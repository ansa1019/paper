item 1a. risk factors you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k and other documents we file with the sec. the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as market conditions, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest rates, terrorism, wars or conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic or business conditions. additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, including our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.
conditions in the global economy, the markets we serve and the financial markets may adversely affect our business and financial statements.
our business is sensitive to general economic conditions. slower global economic growth, actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt, volatility in the currency and credit markets, high levels of unemployment, reduced levels of capital expenditures, changes in government fiscal and monetary policies, government deficit reduction and budget negotiation dynamics, sequestration, other austerity measures and other challenges that affect the global economy adversely affect the company and its distributors, customers and suppliers, including having the effect of:
•   reducing demand for our products (in this item 1a, references to products also includes software) and services, limiting the financing available to our customers and suppliers, increasing order cancellations and resulting in longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies;
•   increasing the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and the risk of excess and obsolete inventories;
•   increasing price competition in our served markets;
•   supply interruptions, which could disrupt our ability to produce our products;
•   increasing the risk of impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets, and the risk that we may not be able to fully recover the value of other assets such as real estate and tax assets; and
•   increasing the risk that counterparties to our contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their contractual obligations which, in addition to increasing the risks identified above, could result in preference actions against us.
although we have been able to continue accessing the commercial paper and other capital markets through the date of this report, there can be no assurances that such markets will remain available to us or that the lenders participating in our revolving credit facilities will be able to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations.
if growth in the global economy or in any of the markets we serve slows for a significant period, if there is significant deterioration in the global economy or such markets or if improvements in the global economy don't benefit the markets we serve, our business and financial statements could be adversely affected.
our restructuring actions could have long-term adverse effects on our business.
in recent years, we have implemented multiple, significant restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure, and we may engage in similar restructuring activities in the future. these restructuring activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities (including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses) reduce our available talent, assets and other resources and could slow improvements in our products and services, adversely affect our ability to respond to customers and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases. in addition, delays in implementing planned restructuring activities or other productivity improvements, unexpected costs or failure to meet
16
targeted improvements may diminish the operational or financial benefits we realize from such actions. any of the circumstances described above could adversely impact our business and financial statements.
our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline, do not grow as anticipated or experience cyclicality.
our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve, and visibility into our markets is limited (particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution). our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast. any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our financial statements. certain of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic, cyclical downturns. in addition, in certain of our businesses demand depends on customers' capital spending budgets as well as government funding policies, and matters of public policy and government budget dynamics as well as product and economic cycles can affect the spending decisions of these entities. demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in customer order patterns, which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in incentive programs, new product introductions and customer inventory levels. any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period.
we face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience decreased demand and decreased market share. even if we compete effectively, we may be required to reduce prices for our products and services.
our businesses operate in industries that are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation. because of the range of the products and services we sell and the variety of markets we serve, we encounter a wide variety of competitors; please see "item 1. business - competition" for additional details. in order to compete effectively, we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers, continually developing new products and services to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product and service categories and penetrating new markets, including high-growth markets. our failure to compete effectively and/or pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our financial statements, and our expansion into new markets may result in greater-than-expected risks, liabilities and expenses.
our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization, and customer acceptance, of new and enhanced products and services based on technological innovation.
we generally sell our products and services in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards. if we do not develop innovative new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis, our offerings will become obsolete over time and our competitive position and financial statements will suffer. our success will depend on several factors, including our ability to:
•   correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences;
•   allocate our research and development funding to products and services with higher growth prospects;
•   anticipate and respond to our competitors' development of new products and services and technological innovations;
•   differentiate our offerings from our competitors' offerings and avoid commoditization;
•   innovate and develop new technologies and applications, and acquire or obtain rights to third-party technologies that may have valuable applications in our served markets;
•   obtain adequate intellectual property rights with respect to key technologies before our competitors do;
•   successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner, price them competitively and cost-effectively manufacture and deliver sufficient volumes of new products of appropriate quality on time;
•   obtain necessary regulatory approvals of appropriate scope, including with respect to medical device products by demonstrating satisfactory clinical results where applicable; and
•   stimulate customer demand for and convince customers to adopt new technologies.
in addition, if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue, which would adversely affect our profitability. even if we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services, we may incur substantial costs in doing so, and our profitability may suffer. in addition, promising new offerings may fail to reach
17
the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement.
our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.
we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that would violate u.s. and/or non-u.s. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. in particular, the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the u.s. and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. in addition, though we rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct, material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
any inability to consummate acquisitions at our historical rate and at appropriate prices could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price.
our ability to grow revenues, earnings and cash flow at or above our historic rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies. we may not be able to consummate acquisitions at rates similar to the past, which could adversely impact our growth rate and our stock price. promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including high valuations, competition among prospective buyers, the availability of affordable funding in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms. in addition, competition for acquisitions may result in higher purchase prices. changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or instability in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions.
our acquisition of businesses, joint ventures and strategic relationships could negatively impact our financial statements.
as part of our business strategy we acquire businesses and enter into joint ventures and other strategic relationships in the ordinary course, some of which may be material; please see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" ("md&a") for additional details. these acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic relationships involve a number of financial, accounting, managerial, operational, legal, compliance and other risks and challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect our financial statements:
•   any acquired business, technology, service or product could under-perform relative to our expectations and the price that we paid for it, or not perform in accordance with our anticipated timetable.
•   we may incur or assume significant debt in connection with our acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic relationships.
•   acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic relationships could cause our financial results to differ from our own or the investment community's expectations in any given period, or over the long-term.
•   pre-closing and post-closing earnings charges could adversely impact operating results in any given period, and the impact may be substantially different from period to period.
•   acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic relationships could create demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems that we are unable to effectively address.
•   we could experience difficulty in integrating personnel, operations and financial and other controls and systems and retaining key employees and customers.
•   we may be unable to achieve cost savings or other synergies anticipated in connection with an acquisition, joint venture or strategic relationship.
•   we may assume by acquisition, joint venture or strategic relationship unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized, known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from the acquired company's activities. the realization of any of these liabilities or
18
deficiencies may increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial position or cause us to fail to meet our public financial reporting obligations.
•   in connection with acquisitions and joint ventures, we often enter into post-closing financial arrangements such as purchase price adjustments, earn-out obligations and indemnification obligations, which may have unpredictable financial results.
•   as a result of our acquisitions, we have recorded significant goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet. if we are not able to realize the value of these assets, we may be required to incur charges relating to the impairment of these assets.
•   we may have interests that diverge from those of our joint venture partners or other strategic partners and we may not be able to direct the management and operations of the joint venture or other strategic relationship in the manner we believe is most appropriate, exposing us to additional risk.
the indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities.
certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it. in most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. we cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements.
divestitures or other dispositions could negatively impact our business, and contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our financial statements.
we continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest, spin-off, split-off or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment. these transactions pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business. for example, when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated timeframe or at all, and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell or dispose a business the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of pre-closing conditions which may not become satisfied. in addition, divestitures or other dispositions may dilute the company's earnings per share, have other adverse financial and accounting impacts and distract management, and disputes may arise with buyers. in addition, we have retained responsibility for and/or have agreed to indemnify buyers against some known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we have sold or disposed. the resolution of these contingencies has not had a material effect on our financial statements but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue.
we are pursuing a plan to distribute ownership of our communications business to danaher shareholders and merge the business into a subsidiary of netscout in a tax-free transaction. the proposed transaction may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or at all and may not achieve the intended benefits.
danaher has announced plans to distribute ownership of its communications business to danaher shareholders in either a spin-off transaction, a split-off transaction, or a combination split-off and spin-off and merge the business into a subsidiary of netscout. both the distribution and merger are expected to qualify as tax-free transactions to danaher and its shareholders, except to the extent that cash is paid to danaher stockholders in lieu of fractional shares. unanticipated developments, including delays in obtaining or satisfying (or failure to obtain or satisfy) tax rulings, regulatory approvals, netscout shareholder approval and other conditions to closing, and challenges in establishing infrastructure or processes, could delay or prevent the proposed transaction or cause the proposed transaction to occur on terms or conditions that are less favorable and/or different than expected. on december 24, 2014, netscout received a request for additional information ("second request") from the u.s. department of justice. the effect of the second request is to extend the waiting period imposed by the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act until 30 days after both netscout and danaher have substantially complied with the request, unless that period is extended voluntarily by the parties or terminated sooner by the u.s. department of justice. even if the transaction is completed, some or all of the anticipated value and benefits therefrom may not be achieved. expenses incurred to accomplish the proposed transaction may be significantly higher than what we currently anticipate. executing the proposed transaction also requires significant time and attention from management, which could distract them from other tasks in operating our business. following the proposed separation and merger, the combined value of the common stock of danaher and the shares of common stock of netscout issued as consideration for our communications business may not be equal to or greater than what the value of danaher's common stock would have been had the proposed transaction not occurred.
19
certain of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the u.s. fda and by comparable agencies of other countries, as well as laws regulating fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and the privacy and security of health information. failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our reputation and financial statements.
certain of our products are medical devices and other products that are subject to regulation by the u.s. fda, by comparable agencies of other countries and regions and by regulations governing radioactive or other hazardous materials (or the manufacture and sale of products containing such materials). we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain regulatory clearance or approvals (such as 510(k) clearance) for our new products or modifications to (or additional indications or uses of) existing products within our anticipated timeframe or at all, and if we do obtain such clearance or approval it may be time-consuming, costly and subject to restrictions. our ability to obtain such regulatory clearances or approvals will depend on many factors, for example our ability to obtain the necessary clinical trial results, and the process for obtaining such clearances or approvals could change over time and may require the withdrawal of products from the market until such clearances are obtained. failure to obtain such regulatory clearances or approvals before marketing our products (or before implementing modifications to or promoting additional indications or uses of our products), other violations of these regulations, real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns or trends of adverse events with respect to our products (even after obtaining clearance for distribution) and unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials can lead to fda form 483 inspectional observations, warning letters, notices to customers, declining sales, loss of customers, loss of market share, recalls, seizures of adulterated or misbranded products, injunctions, administrative detentions, refusals to permit importations, partial or total shutdown of production facilities or the implementation of operating restrictions, narrowing of permitted uses for a product, suspension or withdrawal of approvals and pre-market notification rescissions. we are also subject to various laws regulating fraud and abuse, pricing and sales and marketing practices in the healthcare industry and the privacy and security of health information, including the federal regulations described in "item 1 - business - regulatory matters." many states and foreign countries have also adopted laws and regulations similar to, and in some cases more stringent than, such federal regulations. for more information regarding regulations we are subject to please see "item 1 - business - regulatory matters."
failure to comply with the regulations described above could result in the adverse effects referenced below under "our businesses are subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and reputation." compliance with these and other regulations may also require us to incur significant expenses.
the healthcare industry and related industries that we serve have undergone, and are in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce costs, which could adversely affect our financial statements.
the healthcare industry and related industries that we serve have undergone, and are in the process of undergoing, significant changes in an effort to reduce costs, including the following:
•   many of our customers, and the end-users to whom our customers supply products, rely on government funding of and reimbursement for healthcare products and services and research activities. the u.s. patient protection and affordable care act, as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act (collectively, the "ppaca"), healthcare austerity measures in other countries and other potential healthcare reform changes and government austerity measures may reduce the amount of government funding or reimbursement available to customers or end-users of our products and services and/or the volume of medical procedures using our products and services. global economic uncertainty or deterioration can also adversely impact government funding and reimbursement.
•   the ppaca imposes a 2.3% excise tax on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the united states as well as reporting and disclosure requirements on medical device manufacturers.
•   governmental and private healthcare providers and payors around the world are increasingly utilizing managed care for the delivery of healthcare services, forming group purchasing organizations to improve their purchasing leverage and using competitive bid processes to procure healthcare products and services.
these changes as well as other impacts from market demand, government regulations, third party coverage and reimbursement policies and societal pressures have increased our tax liabilities and may cause participants in the healthcare industry and related industries that we serve to purchase fewer of our products and services, reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services, reduce the amounts of reimbursement and funding available for our products services from governmental agencies or third-party payors, reduce the volume of medical procedures that use our products and services and increase our compliance and other costs. in addition, we may be unable to enter into contracts with group purchasing organizations and integrated health networks on terms acceptable to us, and even if we do enter into such contracts they may be on terms that negatively affect our current or future profitability. all of the factors described above could adversely affect our financial statements.
20
our operations, products and services expose us to the risk of environmental, health and safety liabilities, costs and violations that could adversely affect our reputation and financial statements.
our operations, products and services are subject to environmental laws and regulations, which impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the use, generation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. we must also comply with various health and safety regulations in the united states and abroad in connection with our operations. we cannot assure you that our environmental, health and safety compliance program has been or will at all times be effective. failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and damage to our reputation. in addition, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements.
in addition, we may incur costs related to remedial efforts or alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices. we are also from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances. we may also become subject to additional remedial, compliance or personal injury costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws or regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies, changes in the conduct of our operations and changes in accounting rules. for additional information regarding these risks, please refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. we cannot assure you that our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our reputation and financial statements or that we will not be subject to additional claims for personal injury or remediation in the future based on our past, present or future business activities. however, based on the information we currently have we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of our reserves as of december 31, 2014 will have a material effect on our financial statements.
our businesses are subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial statements and reputation.
in addition to the environmental, health, safety, healthcare, medical device, anticorruption and other regulations noted above, our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by u.s. and non-u.s. governmental and self-regulatory entities at the supranational, federal, state, local and other jurisdictional levels, including the following:
•   we are required to comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons and dealings between our employees and subsidiaries. in certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies. in other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to, and increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inventory.
•   we also have agreements to sell products and services to government entities and are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with government entities. the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. for example, many government contracts contain pricing and other terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. our agreements with government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification at the convenience of the government or in the event of changes in government requirements, reductions in federal spending and other factors, and we may underestimate our costs of performing under the contract. government contracts that have been awarded to us following a bid process could become the subject of a bid protest by a losing bidder, which could result in loss of the contract. we are also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts.
these are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with. the regulations we are subject to have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions. we, our representatives and the industries in which we operate may at times be under review and/or investigation by regulatory authorities. failure to comply (or any alleged or perceived failure to comply) with the regulations referenced above or any other regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, and any such failure or alleged failure (or becoming subject to a regulatory enforcement investigation) could also damage to our reputation, disrupt our business, limit our ability to manufacture, import, export and sell products and services, result in loss of customers and disbarment from selling to certain federal agencies and cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. compliance with these and other regulations may also affect our returns on investment, require us to incur significant expenses or modify our business model or impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our business. our products and operations are also often
21
subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the international standards organization, and failure to comply with these rules could result in withdrawal of certifications needed to sell our products and services and otherwise adversely impact our financial statements. for additional information regarding these risks, please refer to "item 1. business - regulatory matters."
we may be required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and other intangible assets.
as of december 31, 2014, the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately $24.3 billion. in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired. significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of our assets, changes in the structure of our business, divestitures, market capitalization declines, or increases in associated discount rates may impair our goodwill and other intangible assets. any charges relating to such impairments would adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized.
foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements.
sales and purchases in currencies other than the u.s. dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar and may adversely affect our financial statements. increased strength of the u.s. dollar (such as the strengthening that has taken place in recent periods) increases the effective price of our products sold in u.s. dollars into other countries, which may require us to lower our prices or adversely affect sales to the extent we do not increase local currency prices. decreased strength of the u.s. dollar could adversely affect the cost of materials, products and services we purchase overseas. sales and expenses of our non-u.s. businesses are also translated into u.s. dollars for reporting purposes and the strengthening or weakening of the u.s. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects. in addition, certain of our businesses may invoice customers in a currency other than the business' functional currency, and movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could also result in unfavorable translation effects. the company also faces exchange rate risk from its investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries.
changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments could affect our profitability. in addition, audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods.
we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and in various non-u.s. jurisdictions. please see the md&a for a discussion of the factors that may adversely affect our effective tax rate and decrease our profitability in any period. the impact of these factors may be substantially different from period to period. in addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by u.s. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-u.s. tax authorities, such as the audits described in the md&a and the company's financial statements. due to the potential for changes to tax laws (or changes to the interpretation thereof) and the ambiguity of tax laws, the subjectivity of factual interpretations, the complexity of our intercompany arrangements and other factors, our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments. if these audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves, our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities and our financial statements could be adversely affected. if we determine to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have been considered permanently re-invested under existing accounting standards, it could also increase our effective tax rate. in addition, any significant change to the tax system in the u.s. or in other jurisdictions, including changes in the taxation of international income, could adversely affect our financial statements.
we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our financial statements.
we are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business (or the business operations of previously owned entities), including claims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, competition and sales and trading practices, environmental matters, personal injury, insurance coverage and acquisition or divestiture-related matters, as well as regulatory investigations or enforcement. we may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from, or representations, warranties or indemnities provided in connection with, divested businesses. these lawsuits may include claims for compensatory damages, punitive and consequential damages and/or injunctive relief. the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management's attention, we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits, and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial statements. moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses. in addition, developments in proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements, record estimates for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments. any of these developments could adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period. we cannot
22
assure you that our liabilities in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and reputation. however, based on our experience, current information and applicable law, we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in excess of our reserves as of december 31, 2014 will have a material effect on our financial statements.
if we do not or cannot adequately protect our intellectual property, or if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights, we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights.
we own numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others, which in aggregate are important to our business. the intellectual property rights that we obtain, however, may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage, and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us. in addition, the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged, invalidated, circumvented, designed-around or becoming subject to compulsory licensing, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected. in some circumstances, enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons, or countries may require compulsory licensing of our intellectual property. we also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. there can be no assurance that these agreements will adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights. our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage, adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our competitive position and financial statements.
third parties may claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we could suffer significant litigation expenses, losses or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.
from time to time, we receive notices from third parties alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation. any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of many of our technologies and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation. our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation. in addition, as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation, we could lose our rights to critical technology, be unable to license critical technology or sell critical products and services, be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign our products at substantial cost, any of which could adversely impact our competitive position and financial statements. even if we successfully defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation, we may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could adversely affect our financial statements.
defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products (including software) or services could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.
manufacturing or design defects or "bugs" in, unanticipated use of, safety or quality issues (or the perception of such issues) with respect to, or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of products and services that we make or sell (including items that we source from third parties) can lead to personal injury, death, property damage or other liability. these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts, result in the removal of a product or service from the market and result in product liability or similar claims being brought against us. recalls, removals and product liability and similar claims (regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome) can result in significant costs, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services.
the manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if we directly or indirectly encounter problems manufacturing products, our reputation, business and financial statements could suffer.
the manufacture of many of our products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, natural disasters and environmental factors, and if not discovered before the product is released to market could result in recalls and product liability exposure. because of the time required to approve and license certain regulated manufacturing facilities, an alternative manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace such production capacity. any of these manufacturing problems could result in significant costs and liability, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products.
23
our indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow, and any failure to comply with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness could adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements.
as of december 31, 2014, we had approximately $3.5 billion in outstanding indebtedness. in addition, based on the availability under our credit facilities as of december 31, 2014, we had the ability to incur an additional $1.7 billion of indebtedness in direct borrowings or under our outstanding commercial paper facilities. our debt level and related debt service obligations can have negative consequences, including (1) requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes such as acquisitions and capital investment; (2) reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions; and (3) exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates. we may incur significantly more debt in the future, particularly to finance acquisitions, and there can be no assurance that our cost of funding will not substantially increase.
our current revolving credit facility and long-term debt obligations also impose certain restrictions on us; for more information please refer to the md&a. if we breach any of these restrictions and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, subject to applicable cure periods the outstanding indebtedness (and any other indebtedness with cross-default provisions) could be declared immediately due and payable, which would adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements. in addition, any failure to maintain the credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies would adversely affect our cost of funds and could adversely affect our liquidity and access to the capital markets. if we add new debt, the risks described above could increase.
adverse changes in our relationships with, or the financial condition, performance, purchasing patterns or inventory levels of, key distributors and other channel partners could adversely affect our financial statements.
certain of our businesses sell a significant amount of their products to key distributors and other channel partners that have valuable relationships with customers and end-users. some of these distributors and other partners also sell our competitors' products or compete with us directly, and if they favor competing products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively. adverse changes in our relationships with these distributors and other partners, or adverse developments in their financial condition, performance or purchasing patterns, could adversely affect our financial statements.  the levels of inventory maintained by our distributors and other channel partners, and changes in those levels, can also significantly impact our results of operations in any given period. in addition, the consolidation of distributors and customers in certain of our served industries could adversely impact our profitability.
our financial results are subject to fluctuations in the cost and availability of commodities that we use in our operations.
as discussed in "item 1. business - materials," our manufacturing and other operations employ a wide variety of components, raw materials and other commodities. prices for and availability of these components, raw materials and other commodities have fluctuated significantly in the past. any sustained interruption in the supply of these items could adversely affect our business. in addition, due to the highly competitive nature of the industries that we serve, the cost-containment efforts of our customers and the terms of certain contracts we are party to, if commodity prices rise we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices. if we are unable to fully recover higher commodity costs through price increases or offset these increases through cost reductions, or if there is a time delay between the increase in costs and our ability to recover or offset these costs, we could experience lower margins and profitability and our financial statements could be adversely affected.
if we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity or the purchases required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changes in market conditions and customer demand, our profitability may suffer. in addition, our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials, components and services could cause production interruptions, delays and inefficiencies.
we purchase materials, components and equipment from third parties for use in our manufacturing operations. our income could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations, including those caused by seasonality or cyclicality. during a market upturn, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices. if we cannot purchase sufficient products at competitive prices and quality and on a timely enough basis to meet increasing demand, we may not be able to satisfy market demand, product shipments may be delayed, our costs may increase or we may breach our contractual commitments and incur liabilities. conversely, in order to secure supplies for the production of products, we sometimes enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands. if demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer.
24
in addition, some of our businesses purchase certain requirements from sole or limited source suppliers (including freight carriers) for reasons of quality assurance, cost effectiveness, availability or uniqueness of design. if these or other suppliers encounter financial, operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes, we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply. the supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints, bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reasons, decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities and external events such as natural disasters, pandemic health issues, war, terrorist actions, governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes. any of these factors could result in production interruptions, delays, extended lead times and inefficiencies.
because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions, our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements. any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers, provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our profitability.
changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or services or increase our expenses.
we compete in markets in which we and our customers must comply with supranational, federal, state, local and other jurisdictional regulations, such as regulations governing health and safety, the environment, food and drugs, privacy and electronic communications. we develop, configure and market our products and services to meet customer needs created by these regulations. these regulations are complex, change frequently, have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions. any significant change in any of these regulations (or in the interpretation or application thereof) could reduce demand for, increase our costs of producing or delay the introduction of new or modified products and services, or could restrict our existing activities, products and services. in addition, in certain of our markets our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulations. in these markets, the delay or failure of governmental and other entities to adopt or enforce new regulations, or the adoption of new regulations which our products and services are not positioned to address, could adversely affect demand. in addition, regulatory deadlines may result in substantially different levels of demand for our products and services from period to period.
work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes could adversely impact our productivity and results of operations.
we have a number of u.s. collective bargaining units and various non-u.s. collective labor arrangements. we are subject to potential work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes, any of which could adversely impact our productivity, results of operations and reputation.
international economic, political, legal, compliance and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements.
in 2014, approximately 57% of our sales were derived from customers outside the u.s. in addition, many of our manufacturing operations, suppliers and employees are located outside the u.s. since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the u.s. and increase the localization of our products and services, we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the u.s., particularly in the high-growth markets. our international business (and particularly our business in high-growth markets) is subject to risks that are customarily encountered in non-u.s. operations, including:
•   interruption in the transportation of materials to us and finished goods to our customers;
•   differences in terms of sale, including payment terms;
•   local product preferences and product requirements;
•   changes in a country's or region's political or economic conditions, such as the recent devaluation of the russian ruble, the effects of the international sanctions that have recently been imposed upon russia and the elimination of the swiss franc's cap against the euro;
•   trade protection measures, embargoes and import or export restrictions and requirements;
•   unexpected changes in laws or regulatory requirements, including negative changes in tax laws;
•   limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings and cash;
•   the potential for nationalization of enterprises;
•   changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs;
25
•   limitations on legal rights and our ability to enforce such rights;
•   difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;
•   differing labor regulations;
•   difficulties in implementing restructuring actions on a timely or comprehensive basis; and
•   differing protection of intellectual property.
any of these risks could negatively affect our financial statements and growth.
if we suffer loss to our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe or other events, our operations could be seriously harmed.
our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, earthquake, hurricane, public health crisis, war, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. if any of these facilities, supply chains or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in defective products or services, damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and large repair or replacement expenses. the third-party insurance coverage that we maintain will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost, availability and our decisions regarding risk retention, and may be unavailable or insufficient to protect us against losses.
a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems could adversely affect our business.
we rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information (including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees, customers and other business partners), and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities. these systems may be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events, and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. in addition, security breaches of our systems (or the systems of our customers, suppliers or other business partners) could result in the misappropriation, destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers. like many multinational corporations, our information technology systems have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access and other cyber-attacks and we expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future as such attacks become more sophisticated and frequent. any of the attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in theft of our and our customers' intellectual property and trade secrets, damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation, each of which could adversely affect our business and financial statements.
our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our financial statements.
the performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our defined benefit pension plan expenses and funding obligations. significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets, investment losses on plan assets and changes in discount rates may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial statements. in addition, upward pressure on the cost of providing healthcare coverage to current employees and retirees may increase our future funding obligations and adversely affect our financial statements.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&a") is designed to provide a reader of danaher's financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of company management. the company's md&a is divided into five sections:
•   overview
•   results of operations
•   liquidity and capital resources
•   critical accounting estimates
•   new accounting standards overview general please see "item 1. business - general" for a discussion of danaher's objectives and methodologies for delivering shareholder value. danaher is a multinational corporation with global operations. during 2014, approximately 57% of danaher's sales were derived from customers outside the united states. as a diversified, global business, danaher's operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry-specific economic and political factors. danaher's geographic and industry diversity, as well as the range of its products and services, typically help limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on the consolidated operating results. given the broad range of products manufactured, software and services provided and geographies served, management does not use any indices other than general economic trends to predict the overall outlook for the company. the company's individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers, including to the extent possible their sales, to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future.
as a result of the company's geographic and industry diversity, the company faces a variety of opportunities and challenges, including rapid technological development (particularly with respect to computing, mobile connectivity, communications and digitization) in most of the company's served markets, the expansion and evolution of opportunities in high-growth markets, trends and costs associated with a global labor force, consolidation of the company's competitors and increasing regulation. the company operates in a highly competitive business environment in most markets, and the company's long-term growth and profitability will depend in particular on its ability to expand its business in high-growth geographies and high-growth market segments, identify, consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions, develop innovative and differentiated new products, services and software with higher gross profit margins, expand and improve the effectiveness of the company's sales force, continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality, and effectively address the demands of an increasingly regulated environment. the company is making significant investments, organically and through acquisitions, to address the rapid pace of technological change in its served markets and to globalize its manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources (particularly in high-growth markets) in order to be responsive to the company's customers throughout the world and improve the efficiency of the company's operations.
business performance and outlook while differences exist among the company's businesses, on an overall basis, demand for the company's products, software and services increased in 2014 compared to 2013 driving year-over-year sales growth from existing businesses. the company's continued investments in sales growth initiatives and the other business-specific factors discussed below also contributed to year-over-year sales growth. geographically, year-over-year sales growth rates from existing businesses during 2014 were led primarily by the high-growth markets. sales from existing businesses in high-growth markets grew at a mid-single digit rate in 2014 compared to 2013 and sales from high-growth markets represented approximately 26% of the company's total sales in 2014. sales from existing businesses in developed markets grew at a low-single digit rate in 2014 compared to 2013 and were driven by north america and western europe. the company expects overall sales growth to continue but remains cautious about challenges due to macro-economic and geopolitical uncertainties and global uncertainties related to monetary and fiscal policies.  while individual business results will vary, the company expects sales from existing businesses to continue to grow on a year-over-year basis during 2015 at a level in line with the growth levels experienced in 2014.

restructuring activities consistent with the company's approach of positioning itself to provide superior products and services to its customers in a cost efficient manner, in the second half of 2014 the company initiated actions to improve productivity and reduce costs in its businesses. the actions, which were substantially completed by december 31, 2014, resulted in pre-tax charges of approximately $155 million, the majority of which was incurred in the fourth quarter of 2014. the charges, including both employee-related termination costs as well as other termination and exit costs, are expected to result in savings of approximately $125 million in 2015 compared to 2014 expense levels.
in addition, the company incurred $107 million of costs associated with restructuring activities in 2013 which resulted in savings of approximately $75 million in 2014 compared to 2013 expense levels.
acquisitions and divestitures on december 11, 2014, the company successfully completed its tender offer for the outstanding shares of common stock of nobel biocare holding ag, acquiring 97% of the outstanding shares for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately chf 1.9 billion (approximately $1.9 billion based on exchange rates as of the date the shares of common stock were acquired) including debt assumed and net of cash acquired. danaher is in the process of acquiring the remaining outstanding nobel biocare shares by means of a squeeze-out transaction, as permitted under swiss law. headquartered in zurich, switzerland, nobel biocare is a world leader in the field of innovative implant-based dental restorations with a portfolio of solutions that include dental implant systems, high-precision individualized prosthetics, biomaterials and digital diagnostics, treatment planning and guided surgery. nobel biocare had revenues of €567 million in 2013 (approximately $780 million based on exchange rates as of december 31, 2013), and is now part of the company's dental segment. the company financed the acquisition of nobel biocare from available cash.
in addition to the acquisition of nobel biocare, during 2014 the company acquired sixteen businesses for total consideration of approximately $1.3 billion in cash, net of cash acquired. the businesses acquired complement existing units of the test & measurement, environmental, life sciences & diagnostics and dental segments. the aggregate annual sales of these sixteen businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the company's revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $420 million.
in the fourth quarter of 2014, danaher entered into a definitive agreement with netscout to combine the majority of the company's test & measurement segment's communications business with netscout (danaher will retain the data communications cable installation business and the communication service provider (field and test tool systems) business of fluke networks and these will become part of the test & measurement segment's instruments business following the closing of the transaction). the transaction will be structured as a distribution of the communications business to danaher shareholders in either a spin-off transaction, a split-off transaction, or a combination split-off and spin-off, followed by a merger of the communications business with a subsidiary of netscout for consideration of 62.5 million netscout shares, subject to adjustment. both the distribution and merger are expected to qualify as tax-free transactions to danaher and its shareholders, except to the extent that cash is paid to danaher stockholders in lieu of fractional shares. if danaher elects a spin-off, all danaher shareholders will participate pro-rata. if danaher elects a split-off, danaher will conduct an exchange offer pursuant to which its shareholders will elect whether to exchange danaher shares for common units of the communications business. if the split-off exchange offer is not fully subscribed, the additional common units of the communications business held by danaher will be distributed in a spin-off on a pro rata basis to danaher shareholders. danaher will determine which approach it will take prior to closing the transaction and no decision has been made at this time. at closing, depending on the number of shares of netscout common stock outstanding, danaher shareholders will receive approximately 60% of the common shares of netscout stock outstanding following the combination.
the transaction remains subject to approval by netscout's shareholders and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the absence of a material adverse change with respect to either the communications business or netscout. on december 24, 2014, netscout received a request for additional information ("second request") from the u.s. department of justice. the effect of the second request is to extend the waiting period imposed by the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act until 30 days after both netscout and danaher have substantially complied with the request, unless that period is extended voluntarily by the parties or terminated sooner by the u.s. department of justice. upon the closing of the transaction, the company will classify the communications business as a discontinued operation in its historical financial statements. sales of the communications business to be combined with netscout represented 22% of the sales of the test & measurement segment for the year ended december 31, 2014. the transaction is expected to be completed in 2015.
32
in august 2014, the company completed the divestiture of its electric vehicle systems ("evs")/hybrid product line for a sale price of $87 million in cash. this product line, which was part of the industrial technologies segment, had revenues of approximately $60 million in 2014 prior to the divestiture and approximately $100 million in each of 2013 and 2012. operating results of the product line were not significant to segment or overall company reported results in 2014. the company recorded a pre-tax gain on the sale of the product line of $34 million ($26 million after-tax or $0.04 per diluted share) in its third quarter 2014 results. subsequent to the sale, the company has no continuing involvement in the evs/hybrid product line.
for a discussion of the company's 2013 and 2012 acquisition and divestiture activity, refer to "liquidity and capital resources - investing activities".
sale of investments during 2014, the company received cash proceeds of $167 million from the sale of certain marketable equity securities and recorded a pre-tax gain related to these sales of $123 million ($77 million after-tax or $0.11 per diluted share).
results of operations consolidated sales for the year ended december 31, 2014 increased 4.0% compared to 2013. sales from existing businesses contributed 3.5% growth and sales from acquired businesses contributed 1.5% growth on a year-over-year basis. the impact of currency translation reduced reported sales by 1.0% as the u.s. dollar was, on average, stronger against other major currencies during 2014 as compared to exchange rate levels during 2013.
consolidated sales for the year ended december 31, 2013 increased 4.5% compared to 2012. sales from existing businesses contributed 2.5% growth and sales from acquired businesses contributed 2.5% growth on a year-over-year basis. the impact of currency translation reduced reported sales by 0.5% as the u.s. dollar was, on average, stronger against other major currencies during 2013 as compared to exchange rate levels during 2012.
in this report, references to sales from existing businesses refers to sales from continuing operations calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states ("gaap") but excluding (1) sales from acquired businesses and (2) the impact of currency translation. references to sales or operating profit attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to gaap sales or operating profit, as applicable, from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition less the amount of sales attributable to certain divested product lines not considered discontinued operations. the portion of revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between (a) the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding sales from acquired businesses) and (b) the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding sales from acquired businesses) after applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period. sales from existing businesses should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, sales, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. management believes that reporting the non-gaap financial measure of sales from existing businesses provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with our performance in prior and future periods and to our peers. the company excludes the effect of currency translation from sales from existing businesses because currency translation is not under management's control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends, and excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestiture related items because the nature, size and number of acquisitions and divestitures can vary dramatically from period to period and between the company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult. references to sales volume refer to the impact of both price and unit sales.
operating profit margins were 17.2% for the year ended december 31, 2014 as compared to 17.1% in 2013. the following factors impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons.
2014 vs. 2013 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by:
•   higher 2014 sales volumes and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2013 and 2014, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various product development, sales and marketing growth investments - 65 basis points
•   the fourth quarter 2013 impairment of intangible assets associated with a technology investment in the communications business - 15 basis points
33
2014 vs. 2013 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by:
•   incremental year-over-year costs associated with restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives - 25 basis points
•   the incremental net dilutive effect in 2014 of acquired businesses and acquisition related charges recorded in 2014 associated with the nobel biocare acquisition, including transaction costs deemed significant and fair value adjustments to acquired inventory, net of the positive effect of the product line disposition in the third quarter of 2014 - 45 basis points the company deems acquisition-related transaction costs incurred in a given period to be significant (generally relating to the company's larger acquisitions) if it determines that such costs exceed the range of acquisition-related transaction costs typical for the company in a given period.
operating profit margins were 17.1% for the year ended december 31, 2013 as compared to 17.3% in 2012. the following factors impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons.
2013 vs. 2012 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by:
•   higher 2013 sales volumes and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2012 and 2013, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various product development, sales and marketing growth investments - 80 basis points
2013 vs. 2012 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by:
•   the incremental net dilutive effect in 2013 of acquired businesses - 40 basis points
•   the divestiture of the apex joint venture in 2013. prior to the sale, the company had accounted for its investment in apex under the equity method - 40 basis points

2014 compared to 2013
price increases in the segment contributed 0.5% to sales growth on a year-over-year basis during 2014 as compared to 2013 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses. on an overall basis, sales from existing businesses in the segment's instruments, mobile tool and wheel service businesses grew during 2014 as compared to 2013. this growth was more than offset by year-over-year sales declines in the segment's communications businesses.
sales from existing businesses in the segment's instruments business grew at a low-single digit rate during 2014 as compared to 2013, due to increased year-over-year sales of electrical and calibration products, primarily from strong sales of new product offerings. geographically, growth was led by increased demand in north america, china, and western europe.
sales from existing businesses in the segment's communications business declined at a low-double digit rate during 2014 as compared to 2013 as certain large north american network management solutions customers are in the process of migrating to next-generation communication network technology infrastructures, and as a result delayed capital spending on their networks. the communications business is actively working with these customers to support this transition, including by increasing research and development investments to bring to market solutions for these customers' next generation technology requirements. this decline in north america was slightly offset by growth in western europe and the middle east. in addition, in the segment's network security product line sales from existing businesses grew year-over-year, led by north america and western europe. the company expects year-over-year sales growth from existing businesses in the segment's communications businesses for the full-year ending december 31, 2015, but expects sales growth from existing businesses to remain negative on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter of 2015.
as noted above, in the fourth quarter of 2014 danaher entered into a definitive agreement with netscout to combine danaher's communications business with netscout. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to this transaction.
operating profit margins declined 60 basis points during 2014 as compared to 2013. the following factors impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons.
2014 vs. 2013 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by:
•   2013 impact from the impairment of intangible assets associated with a technology investment in the communications business - 90 basis points
35
2014 vs. 2013 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by:
•   lower sales volumes from existing businesses with respect to high margin communications sales as well as incremental year-over-year costs associated with various new product development, sales and marketing growth investments, net of incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2014 and 2013 - 30 basis points
•   incremental year-over-year costs associated with restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives - 60 basis points
•   the incremental net dilutive effect in 2014 of acquired businesses - 60 basis points
2013 compared to 2012
price increases in the segment contributed 0.5% to sales growth on a year-over-year basis during 2013 as compared to 2012 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses.
sales in the segment's instrument business declined at a low-single digit rate during 2013 as compared to 2012, as lower demand for thermography, calibration and electronic test products more than offset modest increases in demand for industrial products. decreased demand in the north american, european and chinese end markets contributed to the decline in sales. however, the company did see demand stabilize during the second half of 2013 as compared to the first half of 2013, particularly in europe and north america.
sales in the segment's communications business grew at a mid-single digit rate during 2013 compared to 2012 with robust year-over-year increase in demand for network security and analysis solutions. geographically, strong year-over-year demand in the north america and latin america regions was somewhat offset by declines in demand in asia.
operating profit margins declined 110 basis points during 2013 as compared to 2012. the favorable impacts of higher operating profit margin communication business products comprising a higher percentage of sales in 2013 compared to 2012 and lower year-over-year costs for restructuring and productivity improvement initiatives were offset by lower year-over-year instrument sales volumes and incremental year-over-year costs associated with various sales, marketing and product development growth investments. in addition, 2013 vs. 2012 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by:
•   the fourth quarter 2013 impairment of intangible assets associated with a technology investment in the communications business - 90 basis points
•   the incremental net dilutive effect in 2013 of acquired businesses - 20 basis points environmental the company's environmental segment products and services help protect the global water supply, facilitate environmental stewardship, enhance the safety of personal data and improve business efficiencies. danaher's water quality business provides instrumentation and disinfection systems to help analyze, treat and manage the quality of ultra-pure, potable, waste, ground and ocean water in residential, commercial, industrial and natural resource applications. danaher's retail/commercial petroleum business is a leading worldwide provider of solutions and services focused on fuel dispensing, remote fuel management, point-of-sale and payment systems, environmental compliance, vehicle tracking and fleet management.

2014 compared to 2013
price increases in the segment contributed 1.0% to sales growth on a year-over-year basis during 2014 as compared with 2013 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses.
41
sales from existing businesses in the segment's product identification business grew at a mid-single digit rate during 2014 as compared to 2013. continued increased demand for marking and coding equipment and related consumables as well as packaging and color solutions was partially offset by continued lower year-over-year demand in consumer electronics related equipment. geographically, year-over-year sales growth was led by north america and europe.
sales from existing businesses in the segment's automation business grew at a low-single digit rate during 2014 as compared to 2013. improved year-over-year demand in industrial automation, in north america distribution and in medical related end-markets was partially offset by lower year-over-year demand in technology, agricultural and defense related end-markets and the effect of exiting certain low-margin original equipment manufacturer product lines which negatively impacted the first half of 2014. geographically, strong year-over-year demand in china and other high-growth markets as well as moderate sales growth in north america, more than offset year-over-year sales declines in europe. during the third quarter of 2014, the company sold its evs/hybrid business. the impact of this divestiture is reflected in "acquisitions (divestitures), net" in the components of sales growth table above as the disposition was not deemed a discontinued operation for financial reporting purposes. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to this transaction.
sales from existing businesses in the segment's other businesses collectively grew at a mid-single digit rate during 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily due to strong demand in the segment's engine retarder business, and to a lesser extent, continued improving demand in the segment's sensors and controls businesses.
operating profit margins increased 160 basis points during 2014 as compared to 2013. year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by:
•   higher 2014 sales volumes and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2013 and 2014, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various product development, sales and marketing growth investments - 115 basis points
•   lower year-over-year costs associated with restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives - 45 basis points
•   the incremental net dilutive effect in 2014 of acquired businesses was fully offset by the positive effect of the product line disposition in the third quarter of 2014
2013 compared to 2012
price increases in the segment contributed 1.5% to sales growth on a year-over-year basis during 2013 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses.
sales from existing businesses in the segment's product identification businesses grew at a mid-single digit rate during 2013 as compared to 2012. continued increased demand for marking and coding equipment and related consumables as well as packaging and color solutions in most end markets was partially offset by lower year-over-year demand in consumer electronics related equipment. sales grew on a year-over-year basis in most major geographies, particularly in north america and latin america.
sales from existing businesses in the segment's automation business declined at a high-single digit rate during 2013 as compared to 2012. continued soft year-over-year demand in the majority of end markets served, particularly technology and defense related end markets, and the impact of exiting certain low-margin oem product lines, was partially offset by increased sales of industrial automation products, primarily in north america. geographically, year-over-year sales declines in europe, china and certain end markets in north america more than offset improving demand in certain high-growth markets.
sales from existing businesses in the segment's other businesses collectively grew at a low-single digit rate during 2013 as compared to 2012. strong year-over-year demand in the segment's energetic materials business was partially offset by lower year-over-year demand in the segment's engine retarder business. sales from existing businesses in the segment's sensors and controls businesses were essentially flat on a year-over-year basis.
operating profit margins increased 40 basis points during 2013 as compared to 2012. the following factors impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons.
2013 vs. 2012 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by:
•   higher 2013 prices and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2012 and 2013, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various product development, sales and marketing growth investments and the impact of lower 2013 unit sales - 80 basis points
42
2013 vs. 2012 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by:
•   the incremental net dilutive effect in 2013 of acquired businesses - 40 basis points cost of sales and gross profit for the year ended december 31

cost of sales increased approximately 3% on a year over year basis during 2014 as compared to 2013, due primarily to the impact of higher year-over-year sales volumes, acquisition related charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory in connection with the acquisition of nobel biocare during the fourth quarter of 2014 and incremental year-over-year costs associated with restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives, partially offset by incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continued productivity improvements taken in 2013 and 2014.
cost of sales increased approximately 4% on a year-over-year basis for 2013 as compared to 2012 due primarily to the impact of higher year-over-year sales volumes and the impact of the u.s. excise tax on medical devices imposed in 2013, partially offset by the year-over-year decline in costs associated with restructuring actions and continued productivity improvements. in 2013, the u.s. imposed a 2.3% excise tax on the sale or importation of certain medical devices, which affected various products in the company's life sciences & diagnostics and dental segments. the excise tax increased the company's 2013 cost of sales as a percentage of revenue on a year-over-year basis by approximately 20 basis points. the impact of the medical devices excise tax was partially mitigated by general price increases implemented during 2013.
gross profit margins increased 30 basis points on a year-over-year basis during 2014 as compared to 2013, due primarily to the favorable impact of higher year-over-year sales volumes and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the restructuring actions and continued productivity improvements taken in 2013 and 2014, partially offset by acquisition related charges associated with fair value adjustments to acquired inventory in connection with the acquisition of nobel biocare during the fourth quarter of 2014 and incremental year-over-year costs associated with restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives.
gross profit margins increased 50 basis points on a year-over-year basis for 2013 as compared to 2012, due primarily to the favorable impact of higher year-over-year sales volumes and the year-over-year decline in costs relating to restructuring actions and continued productivity improvements. the excise tax noted above increased the company's 2013 cost of sales as a percentage of revenue on a year-over-year basis by approximately 20 basis points. the impact of the medical devices excise tax was partially mitigated by general price increases implemented during 2013.

selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased 20 basis points on a year-over-year basis for 2014 compared to 2013. the year-over-year increase reflects incremental year-over-year investments in the company's sales and marketing growth initiatives, higher corporate expenses and incremental year-over-year costs associated with restructuring actions and continuing productivity improvement initiatives. in addition, transaction costs incurred in connection with the closing of the nobel biocare acquisition during the fourth quarter of 2014 unfavorably impacted the year-over-year comparison
43
by approximately five basis points. these increases were partially offset by the benefit of increased leverage of the company's general and administrative cost base resulting from higher 2014 sales, the effect of the 2013 impairment charge related to intangible assets associated with a communications business' technology investment and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with 2013 and 2014 restructuring actions.
selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales remained flat from 2012 to 2013. the benefit of increased leverage of the company's cost base resulting from higher 2013 sales and the year-over-year decline in restructuring costs was offset by incremental year-over-year increases in investments in sales and marketing growth initiatives. year-over-year comparisons were also adversely impacted by an impairment charge related to intangible assets associated with a communications business' technology investment which increased selling, general and administrative expenses by 15 basis points in 2013.
research and development expenses (consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs) as a percentage of sales increased 10 basis points on a year-over-year basis in 2014 as compared to 2013. incremental year-over-year increases in investments in the company's new product development initiatives were the primary contributors to this increase. research and development expenses as a percentage of sales increased 30 basis points on a year-over-year basis in 2013 as compared to 2012 due primarily to new product development initiatives.
other income during 2014, the company received cash proceeds of $167 million from the sale of certain marketable equity securities and recorded a pre-tax gain related to these sales of $123 million ($77 million after-tax or $0.11 per diluted share). in addition, the company completed the divestiture of its evs/hybrid product line for a sale price of $87 million in cash in august 2014. this product line, which was part of the industrial technologies segment, had revenues of approximately $60 million in 2014 prior to the divestiture and approximately $100 million in each of 2013 and 2012. operating results of the product line were not significant to segment or overall company reported results in 2014. the company recorded a pre-tax gain on the sale of the product line of $34 million ($26 million after-tax or $0.04 per diluted share) in its third quarter 2014 results. subsequent to the sale, the company has no continuing involvement in the evs/hybrid product line.
during the fourth quarter of 2013, the company sold approximately 5 million of the approximately 8 million shares of align technology, inc. ("align") common stock that the company received in 2009 as a result of a settlement between align and ormco corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company. the company received cash proceeds of $251 million from the sale of these marketable equity securities and recorded a pre-tax gain of $202 million ($125 million after-tax or $0.18 per diluted share).
on july 4, 2010, the company entered into a joint venture with cooper industries, plc ("cooper"), combining certain of the company's hand tool businesses with cooper's tools business to form a new entity called apex tool group, llc ("apex"). each of cooper and the company had owned a 50% interest in apex, had an equal number of representatives on apex's board of directors and neither joint venture partner controlled the significant operating and financing activities of apex. the company had accounted for its investment in the joint venture based on the equity method of accounting.
during 2012, the company recorded $70 million of earnings from unconsolidated joint venture related to its interest in apex. in february 2013, the company and cooper sold apex to an unrelated third party for approximately $1.6 billion. the company received $797 million from the sale, consisting of cash of $759 million (including $67 million of dividends received prior to closing) and a note receivable of $38 million (which has been subsequently collected). the company recognized a pre-tax gain of $230 million ($144 million after-tax or $0.20 per diluted share) in its first quarter 2013 results in connection with this transaction. the company's share of the 2013 earnings generated by apex prior to the closing of the sale was insignificant. subsequent to the sale of its investment in apex, the company has no continuing involvement in apex's operations.
interest costs for a description of the company's outstanding indebtedness, refer to "-liquidity and capital resources - financing activities and indebtedness" below.
interest expense of $123 million for 2014 was $23 million lower than in 2013, due primarily to the repayment of the $400 million principal amount of 1.3% senior unsecured notes due 2014 (the "2014 notes") upon maturity in june 2014 in addition to the repayment of the €500 million principal amount of eurobond notes due 2013 (the "eurobond notes") and the $300 million principal amount of floating rate senior notes due 2013 (the "2013 notes") upon maturity in july and june 2013, respectively. interest expense of $146 million in 2013 was $12 million lower than the 2012 interest expense of $158 million due primarily to the repayment of the eurobond notes and the 2013 notes.
44
interest income was $17 million, $6 million and $3 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the increase in interest income in 2014 compared to prior periods reflects higher overall cash holdings throughout 2014 compared to 2013 and 2012.
income taxes general income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management's assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in the company's financial statements. the company records the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur.
the company's effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates (including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions), changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and period-to-period changes in such accruals, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns (as discussed below), the expiration of statutes of limitations, the implementation of tax planning strategies, tax rulings, court decisions, settlements with tax authorities and changes in tax laws. for a description of the tax treatment of earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states, refer to "-liquidity and capital resources - cash and cash requirements" below.
the amount of income taxes the company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis. based on these reviews, the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities, tax rulings and court decisions, and the expiration of statutes of limitations, reserves for contingent tax liabilities are accrued or adjusted as necessary. for a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters, please refer to "item 1a. risk factors".
year-over-year changes in the tax provision and effective tax rate the company's effective tax rate related to continuing operations for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was 25.4%, 24.4% and 23.6%, respectively.
the company's effective tax rate for each of 2014, 2013 and 2012 differs from the u.s. federal statutory rate of 35.0% due principally to the company's earnings outside the united states that are indefinitely reinvested and taxed at rates lower than the u.s. federal statutory rate. the effective tax rates for 2014 and 2013 also include the benefit from the reinstatement of certain tax benefits and credits resulting from the enactments of the tax increase prevention act of 2014 and the america tax relief act of 2012. in addition, the effective tax rate of 25.4% in 2014 includes tax expense for audit settlements in various jurisdictions and changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions, partially offset by the release of valuation allowances and the release of reserves upon the expiration of statutes of limitations. the effective tax rates of 24.4% in 2013 and 23.6% in 2012 include recognition of tax benefits associated with favorable resolutions of certain international and domestic uncertain tax positions and the lapse of certain statutes of limitations, partially offset by adjustments of reserve estimates related to prior period uncertain tax positions. the matters referenced above have been treated as discrete items in the periods they occurred and in the aggregate increased the provision for income taxes by approximately 165 basis points in 2014 and reduced the provision for income taxes by approximately 20 basis points in 2013 and 30 basis points in 2012.
the company conducts business globally, and files numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns in the united states federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. the countries in which the company has a significant presence that have significantly lower statutory tax rates than the united states include china, denmark, germany and the united kingdom. the company's ability to obtain a tax benefit from lower statutory tax rates outside of the united states is dependent on its levels of taxable income in these foreign countries. the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate of any individual foreign country would not have a material effect on the company's financial statements given the geographic dispersion of the company's taxable income.
the company and its subsidiaries are routinely examined by various domestic and international taxing authorities. the internal revenue service ("irs") has completed examinations of certain of the company's federal income tax returns through 2009 and is currently examining certain of the company's federal income tax returns for 2010 and 2011. the company's u.s. tax returns for 2012 and 2013 remain open for examination by the irs. in addition, the company has subsidiaries in belgium, brazil, canada, china, denmark, france, finland, germany, india, italy, japan, norway, singapore, sweden, the united kingdom and various other countries, states and provinces that are currently under audit for years ranging from 2002 through 2013.
45
tax authorities in denmark have raised significant issues related to interest accrued by certain of the company's subsidiaries. on december 10, 2013, the company received assessments from the danish tax authority ("skat") totaling approximately dkk 1.2 billion (approximately $190 million based on exchange rates as of december 31, 2014) including interest through december 31, 2014, imposing withholding tax relating to interest accrued in denmark on borrowings from certain of the company's subsidiaries for the years 2004-2009. if the skat claims are successful, it is likely that the company would be assessed additional amounts for years 2010-2012 totaling approximately dkk 650 million (approximately $106 million based on exchange rates as of december 31, 2014). management believes the positions the company has taken in denmark are in accordance with the relevant tax laws and intends to vigorously defend its positions. the company appealed these assessments with the national tax tribunal in 2014 and intends on pursuing this matter through the european court of justice should this appeal be unsuccessful. the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain, could take many years, and could result in a material adverse impact to the company's financial statements, including its effective tax rate.
as previously disclosed, german tax authorities had raised issues related to the deductibility and taxability of interest accrued by certain of the company's subsidiaries. in the fourth quarter of 2014, the company entered into a settlement agreement with the german tax authorities to resolve these open matters through 2014. the company recorded €49 million (approximately $60 million based on exchange rates as of december 31, 2014) of expense for taxes and interest related to this settlement during the fourth quarter of 2014.
the company's effective tax rate for 2015 is expected to be approximately 24.0%. this anticipated rate reflects no benefit from the research and experimentation credit in the united states which expired at the end of 2014.
comprehensive income comprehensive income decreased by $2.0 billion for 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the strengthening of the u.s. dollar compared to most major currencies during the year, in addition to pension and post-retirement plan benefit adjustments.  the company recorded a foreign currency translation loss of $1.2 billion for 2014 compared to a translation loss of $62 million for 2013. pension and post-retirement plan benefit adjustments resulted in a loss of $361 million in 2014 compared to a gain of $289 million in 2013. comprehensive income increased by $599 million for 2013 as compared to 2012, primarily due to increased net earnings for 2013 and the impact of pension and post-retirement plan benefit adjustments.  the company recorded a pension and post-retirement plan benefit gain of $289 million for 2013 compared to a loss of $140 million for 2012.
inflation the effect of inflation on the company's revenues and net earnings was not significant in any of the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 or 2012.
financial instruments and risk management the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit risk, equity prices and commodity prices, each of which could impact its financial statements. the company generally addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. in addition, the company's broad-based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating profit as a whole.
interest rate risk the company manages interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. a change in interest rates on long-term debt impacts the fair value of the company's fixed-rate long-term debt but not the company's earnings or cash flow because the interest on such debt is fixed. generally, the fair market value of fixed-rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. as of december 31, 2014, an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of the company's fixed-rate long-term debt (excluding the lyons, which have not been included in this calculation as the value of this convertible debt is primarily derived from the value of its underlying common stock) by approximately $90 million. however, since the company currently has no plans to repurchase its outstanding fixed-rate instruments before their maturity, the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on the company's fixed-rate long-term debt does not affect the company's results of operations or stockholders' equity.
46
as of december 31, 2014, the company's variable-rate debt obligations consisted primarily of u.s. dollar and euro-based commercial paper borrowings (refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company's outstanding commercial paper balances as of december 31, 2014). as a result, the company's primary interest rate exposure results from changes in short-term interest rates. as these shorter duration obligations mature, the company anticipates issuing additional short-term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings. in 2014, a 10% increase in average market interest rates on the company's commercial paper borrowings would have increased the company's interest expense by approximately $0.1 million. a 10% hypothetical fluctuation is used as the company's actual commercial paper interest rates fluctuated near that amount during 2014.
currency exchange rate risk the company faces transactional exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the united states and from intercompany transactions between affiliates. transactional exchange rate risk arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than danaher's functional currency or the functional currency of our applicable subsidiary. the company also faces translational exchange rate risk related to the translation of financial statements of our foreign operations into u.s. dollars, danaher's functional currency. costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into u.s. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period. as a result, the company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the u.s. dollar. in particular, the company has more sales in european currencies than it has expenses in those currencies. therefore, when european currencies strengthen or weaken against the u.s. dollar, operating profits are increased or decreased, respectively. the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company's net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of stockholders' equity. a 10% depreciation in major currencies relative to the u.s. dollar as of december 31, 2014 would have resulted in a reduction of stockholders' equity of approximately $1.0 billion.
currency exchange rates negatively impacted 2014 reported sales by 1.0% on a year-over-year basis as the u.s. dollar was, on average, stronger against most major currencies during 2014 as compared to exchange rate levels during 2013. if the exchange rates in effect as of december 31, 2014 were to prevail throughout 2015, currency exchange rates would adversely impact 2015 estimated sales by approximately 3.5% relative to the company's performance in 2014 due to the continued strengthening of the u.s. dollar against most major currencies at the end of the fourth quarter of 2014. additional strengthening of the u.s. dollar against other major currencies would further adversely impact the company's sales and results of operations on an overall basis. any weakening of the u.s. dollar against other major currencies would positively impact the company's sales and results of operations.
the company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk. both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the u.s. dollar will therefore continue to affect the reported amount of sales, profit, and assets and liabilities in the company's consolidated financial statements.
on april 2, 2014, the company terminated the japanese yen/u.s. dollar currency swap agreement that had been acquired in connection with a prior business acquisition. the currency swap agreement initially required the company to purchase approximately 184 million japanese yen (jpy/¥) at a rate of $1/¥102.25 on a monthly basis through june 1, 2018. the currency swap did not qualify for hedge accounting, and as a result, changes in the fair value of the currency swap were reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings each reporting period. the fair value of the currency swap as of the termination date was not significant and the fair value had not changed significantly during 2014 prior to the swap being terminated. during the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, the company recorded pre-tax income of $14 million and $22 million, respectively, related to changes in the fair value of this currency swap.
credit risk the company is exposed to potential credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to its financial instruments. financial instruments that potentially subject the company to credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments, receivables from customers and derivatives. the company places cash and temporary investments with various high-quality financial institutions throughout the world and exposure is limited at any one institution. although the company typically does not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations, it does regularly monitor the third party depository institutions that hold its cash and cash equivalents. the company's emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds.

in addition, concentrations of credit risk arising from receivables from customers are limited due to the diversity of the company's customers. the company's businesses perform credit evaluations of their customers' financial conditions as appropriate and also obtain collateral or other security when appropriate.
the company enters into derivative transactions infrequently and, with the exception of the yen swap noted above, such transactions are generally insignificant to the company's financial condition and results of operations. these transactions are entered into only with high-quality financial institutions and exposure at any one institution is limited.
equity price risk the company's available-for-sale investment portfolio includes publicly traded equity securities that are sensitive to fluctuations in market price. changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the company's available-for-sale investments due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the equity securities. a 10% decline in the value of these equity securities as of december 31, 2014 would have reduced the fair value of the company's available-for-sale investment portfolio by $26 million.

liquidity and capital resources management assesses the company's liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. the company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and believes that its operating cash flow and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to allow it to continue investing in existing businesses, consummating strategic acquisitions, paying interest and servicing debt and managing its capital structure on a short and long-term basis.
following is an overview of the company's cash flows and liquidity for the years ended december 31:

•   operating cash flows from continuing operations increased $173 million, or approximately 5%, during 2014 as compared to 2013. cash flow increases generated from higher operating profit, as well as higher non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization, were largely offset by increased investments in working capital. in addition, operating cash flows for 2013 benefited from $67 million of dividends received related to earnings of the apex joint venture.

•   cash paid for acquisitions constituted the most significant use of cash during 2014. the company acquired seventeen businesses during 2014, including the acquisition of nobel biocare, for total consideration (net of cash acquired) of approximately $3.1 billion.
•   during 2014, the company received cash proceeds of $254 million from the sale of certain marketable securities and the divestiture of its evs/hybrid product line.
•   as of december 31, 2014, the company held $3.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents.
operating activities cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for income taxes, restructuring activities, pension funding and other items impact reported cash flows.
operating cash flows from continuing operations were $3.8 billion for 2014, an increase of $173 million, or 5% as compared to 2013. the year-over-year change in operating cash flows from 2013 to 2014 was primarily attributable to the following factors:
•   2014 operating cash flows benefited from higher net earnings as compared to 2013 excluding the impacts of the gains included in other non-operating income in both years. while these non-operating gains are included in earnings, the proceeds from the sales of investments, product lines and discontinued operations are reflected in the investing activities section of the statement of cash flows and, therefore, do not contribute to operating cash flows.
•   the aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories and trade accounts payable provided $27 million in operating cash flows during 2014, compared to $197 million provided in 2013. the amount of cash flow generated from or used by the aggregate of trade accounts receivable, inventories and trade accounts payable depends upon how effectively the company manages the cash conversion cycle, which effectively represents the number of days that elapse from the day it pays for the purchase of raw materials and components to the collection of cash from its customers and can be significantly impacted by the timing of collections and payments in a period.
•   net earnings for 2014 reflected an increase of $44 million of depreciation and amortization expense as compared to 2013. amortization expense primarily relates to the amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with acquisitions. depreciation expense relates to both the company's manufacturing and operating facilities as well as instrumentation leased to customers under operating-type lease arrangements. depreciation and amortization are non-cash expenses that decrease earnings without a corresponding impact to operating cash flows.
•   2013 operating cash flows included $67 million of dividends received related to earnings of the apex joint venture, which was sold in 2013. these dividends increased the 2013 operating cash flows but did not repeat in 2014 due to the sale.
operating cash flows from continuing operations were $3.6 billion for 2013, an increase of $83 million, or 2% as compared to 2012. this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in operating profit in 2013 as compared to 2012.
investing activities cash flows relating to investing activities consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures, including instruments leased to customers, and cash proceeds from divestitures of businesses or assets.
net cash used in investing activities was $3.4 billion during 2014 compared to $553 million and $1.9 billion of net cash used in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
acquisitions, divestitures and sale of investments
2014 acquisitions, divestitures and sale of investments for a discussion of the company's 2014 acquisitions, divestitures and the sale of certain marketable equity securities, refer to "-overview."

2013 acquisitions, divestitures and sale of investments during 2013, the company acquired fourteen businesses for total consideration of $957 million in cash, net of cash acquired. the businesses acquired complement existing units of the industrial technologies, life sciences & diagnostics, environmental and test & measurement segments. the aggregate annual sales of these fourteen businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the company's revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $300 million.
during the fourth quarter of 2013, the company sold approximately 5 million of the approximately 8 million shares of align common stock that the company received in 2009 as a result of a settlement between align and ormco. the company received cash proceeds of $251 million from the sale of these securities and recorded a pre-tax gain of $202 million ($125 million after-tax or $0.18 per diluted share).
on july 4, 2010, the company entered into a joint venture with cooper, combining certain of the company's hand tool businesses with cooper's tools business to form a new entity, apex. in february 2013, the company and cooper sold apex to an unrelated third party for approximately $1.6 billion. the company received $797 million from the sale, consisting of cash of $759 million (including $67 million of dividends received prior to closing) and a note receivable of $38 million (which has been subsequently collected). the company recognized a pre-tax gain of $230 million ($144 million after-tax or $0.20 per diluted share) in its first quarter 2013 results in connection with this transaction.
2012 acquisitions and divestitures during 2012, the company acquired fourteen businesses for total consideration of $1.8 billion in cash, net of cash acquired. the businesses acquired complement existing units of each of the company's five segments. the aggregate annual sales of these fourteen businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the acquired company's revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were $666 million.
in january 2012, the company completed the sale of its integrated scanning system business (the asi business) for $132 million in cash. in addition, in february 2012, the company completed the sale of its keo business for $205 million in cash. these businesses were part of the industrial technologies segment. the businesses had combined annual revenues of $275 million in 2011. the company recorded an aggregate after-tax gain on the sale of these businesses of $94 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, in its first quarter 2012 results. the company has reported the asi and keo businesses as discontinued operations in its consolidated financial statements. accordingly, the results of operations for all periods presented reflect these businesses as discontinued operations.
capital expenditures capital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity, replacing equipment, supporting new product development, improving information technology systems and the manufacture of instruments that are used in operating-type lease arrangements that certain of the company's businesses enter into with customers. capital expenditures totaled $598 million in 2014, $552 million in 2013 and $458 million in 2012. the increase in capital spending in 2014 and 2013 is due primarily to increases in equipment leased to customers. in 2015, the company expects capital spending to be between $650 million and $700 million, though actual expenditures will ultimately depend on business conditions.
financing activities and indebtedness cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper, common stock and debt, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, payments of principal on indebtedness, payments for repurchases of common stock and payments of cash dividends to shareholders. financing activities used cash of $218 million during 2014 compared to $1.6 billion of cash used during 2013. the year-over-year decrease was due primarily to the incrementally lower year-over-year repayment of borrowings with maturities longer than 90 days and incrementally higher year-over-year net proceeds received from the issuance of commercial paper borrowings. the company repaid the 2014 notes upon their maturity in june 2014.

total debt was $3.5 billion as of december 31, 2014 and 2013. the company's debt as of december 31, 2014 was as follows:
•   $765 million of outstanding commercial paper;
•   $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.3% senior unsecured notes due 2016 (the "2016 notes");
•   $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior unsecured notes due 2018 (the "2018 notes");
•   $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.4% senior unsecured notes due 2019 (the "2019 notes");
•   $600 million aggregate principal amount of 3.9% senior unsecured notes due 2021 (the "2021 notes" and together with the 2016 notes, the "2011 financing notes");
•   $130 million (chf 120 million aggregate principal amount) of 4.0% bonds due 2016 (the "2016 bonds");
•   $111 million of zero coupon liquid yield option notes due 2021 ("lyons"); and
•   $118 million of other borrowings.
the 2011 financing notes, the 2018 notes and the 2019 notes are collectively referred to as the "notes".
commercial paper programs and credit facility the company satisfies any short-term liquidity needs that are not met through operating cash flow and available cash primarily through issuances of commercial paper under its u.s. and euro commercial paper programs. under these programs, the company or a subsidiary of the company, as applicable, may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes. interest expense on the notes is paid at maturity and is generally based on the ratings assigned to the company by credit rating agencies at the time of the issuance and prevailing market rates measured by reference to libor. borrowings under the program are available for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. during 2014, as commercial paper balances matured the company either paid such balances from available cash or refinanced such balances by issuing new commercial paper. as of december 31, 2014, the company had $450 million in u.s. dollar denominated commercial paper outstanding and $315 million (€260 million) of commercial paper outstanding under the euro commercial paper program.
as of december 31, 2014, borrowings outstanding under the company's u.s. and euro commercial paper programs had a weighted average annual interest rate of 0.13% and a weighted average remaining maturity of approximately twelve days. commercial paper outstanding at any one time during the year had balances ranging from $450 million to $822 million, carried interest at annual rates ranging between 0.04% and 0.2% and had original maturities between seven and thirty-four days. the company has classified its borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program as of december 31, 2014 as long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheet as the company had the intent and ability, as supported by availability under the credit facility referenced below, to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date.
credit support for the commercial paper program is provided by a $2.5 billion unsecured multi-year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks that expires on july 15, 2016 (the "credit facility"). the credit facility can also be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. under the credit facility, borrowings (other than bid loans) bear interest at a rate equal to (at the company's option) either (1) a libor-based rate plus a margin that varies according to the company's long-term debt credit rating (the "eurodollar rate"), or (2) the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1%, (b) the prime rate and (c) the eurodollar rate plus 1%, plus in each case a margin that varies according to the company's long-term debt credit rating. in addition to certain initial fees the company paid at inception of the credit facility, the company is obligated to pay an annual commitment fee that varies according to its long-term debt credit rating. the credit facility requires the company to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the facility) of 0.65 to 1.00 or less, and also contains customary representations, warranties, conditions precedent, events of default, indemnities and affirmative and negative covenants. as of december 31, 2014, no borrowings were outstanding under the credit facility and the company was in compliance with all covenants under the facility. the non-performance by any member of the credit facility syndicate would reduce the maximum capacity of the credit facility by such member's commitment amount. in addition to the credit facility, the company has entered into reimbursement agreements with various commercial banks to support the issuance of letters of credit.
the availability of the credit facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the existing credit ratings of the company's commercial paper programs. the company expects to limit any borrowings under the credit facility to amounts that would leave sufficient credit available under the facility to allow the company to borrow, if needed, to repay all of the outstanding commercial paper as it matures.
51
the company's ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related costs of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of the company's credit rating and market conditions. any downgrade in the company's credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under the company's commercial paper program and the credit facility, and could limit or preclude the company's ability to issue commercial paper. if the company's access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a downgrade, change in market conditions or otherwise, the company expects it would rely on a combination of available cash, operating cash flow and the company's credit facility to provide short-term funding. in such event, the cost of borrowings under the company's credit facility could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings.
other long-term indebtedness
2013 notes, 2014 notes, 2016 notes and 2021 notes-on june 23, 2011, the company completed the underwritten public offering of the 2011 financing notes, the 2013 notes and the 2014 notes, all of which are (or in the case of the 2013 notes and 2014 notes were) unsecured. the 2013 notes were issued at 100% of their principal amount, accrued interest at a floating rate equal to three-month libor plus 0.25% per year and matured and were repaid in june 2013. the 2014 notes were issued at 99.918% of their principal amount, accrued interest at the rate of 1.3% per year and matured and were repaid in june 2014. the 2016 notes were issued at 99.84% of their principal amount, will mature on june 23, 2016 and accrue interest at the rate of 2.3% per year. the 2021 notes were issued at 99.975% of their principal amount, will mature on june 23, 2021 and accrue interest at the rate of 3.9% per year. the net proceeds from the 2011 financing notes, 2013 notes and 2014 notes offering, after deducting expenses and the underwriters' discount, were approximately $1.8 billion and were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of beckman coulter. the company paid interest on the 2013 notes quarterly in arrears on march 21, june 21, september 21 and december 21 of each year. the company paid interest on the 2014 notes, and pays interest on the 2016 notes and 2021 notes semi-annually in arrears, on june 23 and december 23 of each year.

2016 bonds-in connection with the acquisition of nobel biocare in december 2014, the company acquired bonds with an aggregate principal amount of chf 120 million and a stated interest rate of 4.0% per year. in accordance with accounting for business combinations, the bonds were recorded at their fair value of chf 127 million ($133 million based on exchange rates in effect at the time of the acquisition), as such, for accounting purposes interest charges recorded in the company's statement of earnings reflect an effective interest rate of approximately 0.2% per year. the company will pay interest on the 2016 bonds annually in arrears on october 10 of each year (based on the stated 4.0% interest rate). the 2016 bonds mature on october 10, 2016.
lyons-in 2001, the company issued $830 million (value at maturity) in lyons. the net proceeds to the company were $505 million, of which $100 million was used to pay down debt and the balance was used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. the lyons carry a yield to maturity of 2.375% (with contingent interest payable as described below). holders of the lyons may convert each $1,000 of principal amount at maturity into 29.0704 shares of the company's common stock (in the aggregate for all lyons that were originally issued, approximately 24 million shares of the company's common stock) at any time on or before the maturity date of january 22, 2021. as of december 31, 2014, an aggregate of approximately 20 million shares of the company's common stock had been issued upon conversion of lyons. as of december 31, 2014, the accreted value of the outstanding lyons was lower than the traded market value of the underlying common stock issuable upon conversion. the company may redeem all or a portion of the lyons for cash at any time at scheduled redemption prices.
under the terms of the lyons, the company pays contingent interest to the holders of lyons during any six month period from january 23 to july 22 and from july 23 to january 22 if the average market price of a lyon for a specified measurement period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price and accrued original issue discount for such lyon. the amount of contingent interest to be paid with respect to any quarterly period is equal to the higher of either 0.0315% of the bonds' average market price during the specified measurement period or the amount of the common stock dividend paid during such quarterly
52
period multiplied by the number of shares issuable upon conversion of a lyon. the company paid $2 million, $1 million and $1 million of contingent interest on the lyons for each of the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. except for the contingent interest described above, the company will not pay interest on the lyons prior to maturity.
eurobond notes-on july 21, 2006, a financing subsidiary of the company issued the eurobond notes in a private placement outside the united states. payment obligations under these eurobond notes were guaranteed by the company. the net proceeds of the offering, after the deduction of underwriting commissions but prior to the deduction of other issuance costs, were €496 million ($627 million based on exchange rates in effect at the time the offering closed) and were used to pay down a portion of the company's outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. the eurobond notes matured and were repaid in july 2013.
covenants and redemption provisions applicable to the notes and the 2016 bonds the company may redeem some or all of the 2016 notes, the 2018 notes and/or the 2019 notes at any time by paying the principal amount and a "make-whole" premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest. prior to march 23, 2021 (three months prior to their maturity date), the company may redeem some or all of the 2021 notes by paying the principal amount and a "make-whole" premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest. on or after march 23, 2021, the company may redeem some or all of the 2021 notes for their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. at any time after 85% or more of the 2016 bonds have been redeemed or purchased and canceled, the company may redeem some or all of the remaining 2016 bonds for their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. if a change of control triggering event occurs with respect to the notes, each holder of notes may require the company to repurchase some or all of its notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued interest. a change of control triggering event means the occurrence of both a change of control and a rating event, each as defined in the applicable supplemental indenture. except in connection with a change of control triggering event as described above, the company does not have any credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of outstanding debt.
the indentures pursuant to which the notes were issued each contain customary covenants including, for example, limits on the incurrence of secured debt and sale/leaseback transactions, and the 2016 bonds are subject to similar covenants. none of these covenants are considered restrictive to the company's operations and as of december 31, 2014, the company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants.
for additional details regarding the company's debt as of december 31, 2014 see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.
shelf registration statement the company has filed a "well-known seasoned issuer" shelf registration statement on form s-3 with the sec that registers an indeterminate amount of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares, purchase contracts and units for future issuance. the company expects to use net proceeds realized by the company from future securities sales off this shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes, including without limitation repayment or refinancing of debt or other corporate obligations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, share repurchases and dividends, and working capital.
stock repurchase program on july 16, 2013, the company's board of directors approved a new repurchase program (the "2013 repurchase program") authorizing the repurchase of up to 20 million shares of the company's common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. the 2013 repurchase program replaced the repurchase program approved by the company's board of directors in may 2010 (the "2010 repurchase program"). there is no expiration date for the 2013 repurchase program, and the timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will be determined by the company's management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. the 2013 repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with the company's equity compensation plans (or any successor plan) and for other corporate purposes. as of december 31, 2014, 20 million shares remained available for repurchase pursuant to the 2013 repurchase program. the company expects to fund any future stock repurchases using the company's available cash balances or proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper.
neither the company nor any "affiliated purchaser" repurchased any shares of company common stock during 2014 and 2013. during the year ended december 31, 2012, the company repurchased approximately 12.5 million shares of company common stock under the 2010 repurchase program in open market transactions at a cost of $648 million.

dividends the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share that was paid on january 30, 2015 to holders of record on december 26, 2014. aggregate cash payments for dividends during 2014 were $228 million. dividend payments were higher in 2014 as compared to 2013 as the company increased its quarterly dividend rate in the first quarter of 2014 to $0.10 per share and because the company made no cash payments for dividends during the first quarter of 2013. the company's board accelerated the quarterly dividend payment that normally would have been paid in january 2013 and paid it in december 2012.
cash and cash requirements as of december 31, 2014, the company held approximately $3.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investment grade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less with an approximate weighted average annual interest rate of 0.4%. of this amount $813 million was held within the united states and approximately $2.2 billion was held outside of the united states. the company will continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs, capital expenditures and acquisitions, to pay interest and service debt, pay taxes and any related interest or penalties, fund its restructuring activities and pension plans as required, repurchase shares of the company's common stock, pay dividends to shareholders and support other business needs. the company generally intends to use available cash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements, but in the event that additional liquidity is required, particularly in connection with acquisitions, the company may also borrow under its commercial paper programs or the credit facility, enter into new credit facilities and either borrow directly thereunder or use such credit facilities to backstop additional borrowing capacity under its commercial paper programs and/or access the capital markets. the company also may from time to time access the capital markets, including to take advantage of favorable interest rate environments or other market conditions.
while repatriation of some cash held outside the united states may be restricted by local laws, most of the company's foreign cash balances could be repatriated to the united states but, under current law, could be subject to u.s. federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. for most of its foreign subsidiaries, the company makes an election regarding the amount of earnings intended for indefinite reinvestment, with the balance available to be repatriated to the united states. a deferred tax liability has been accrued for the funds that are available to be repatriated to the united states. no provisions for u.s. income taxes have been made with respect to earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states, and the amount of u.s. income taxes that may be applicable to such earnings is not readily determinable given the various tax planning alternatives the company could employ if it repatriated these earnings. the cash that the company's foreign subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance foreign operations and investments, including acquisitions. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, the total amount of earnings planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states for which deferred taxes have not been provided was approximately $11.8 billion and $10.6 billion, respectively. as of december 31, 2014, management believes that it has sufficient liquidity to satisfy its cash needs, including its cash needs in the united states.
during 2014, the company contributed $52 million to its u.s. defined benefit pension plan and $62 million to its non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans. during 2015, the company's cash contribution requirements for its u.s. and its non-u.s. defined benefit pension plans are expected to be approximately $25 million and $55 million, respectively. the ultimate amounts to be contributed depend upon, among other things, legal requirements, underlying asset returns, the plan's funded status, the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution, local practices, market conditions, interest rates and other factors.
contractual obligations the following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of the company's contractual obligations relating to continuing operations as of december 31, 2014 under (1) long-term debt obligations, (2) leases, (3) purchase obligations and (4) other long-term liabilities reflected on the company's balance sheet under gaap. the amounts presented in the table below do not reflect $804 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, the timing of which is uncertain. refer to note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on unrecognized tax benefits. certain of our acquisitions also involve the potential payment of contingent consideration. the table below does not reflect any such obligations, as the timing and amounts of any such payments are uncertain. refer to "-off-balance sheet arrangements" for a discussion of other contractual obligations that are not reflected in the table below.

(e)   consist of agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction.
(f)   primarily consist of obligations under product service and warranty policies and allowances, performance and operating cost guarantees, estimated environmental remediation costs, self-insurance and litigation claims, post-retirement benefits, pension obligations, deferred tax liabilities (excluding unrecognized tax benefits) and deferred compensation obligations. the timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based upon management's estimates over the terms of these arrangements and is largely based upon historical experience.
off-balance sheet arrangements the following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of off-balance sheet commitments of the company as of december 31, 2014.

guarantees consist primarily of outstanding standby letters of credit, bank guarantees and performance and bid bonds. these guarantees have been provided in connection with certain arrangements with vendors, customers, financing counterparties and governmental entities to secure the company's obligations and/or performance requirements related to specific transactions.
other off-balance sheet arrangements the company has from time to time divested certain of its businesses and assets. in connection with these divestitures, the company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities, such as claims for damages arising out of the use of products or relating to intellectual property matters, commercial disputes, environmental matters or tax matters. the company has not included any such items in the contractual obligations table above because they relate to unknown conditions and the company cannot estimate the potential liabilities from such matters, but the company does not believe it is reasonably possible that any such liability will have a material effect on the company's financial statements. in addition, as a result of these divestitures, as well as restructuring activities, certain properties leased by the company have been sublet to third parties. in the event any of these third parties vacate any of these premises, the
55
company would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements. the company believes that the financial risk of default by such sub-lessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the company's financial statements.
in the normal course of business, the company periodically enters into agreements that require it to indemnify customers, suppliers or other business partners for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the company's products or services or claims alleging that company products, services or software infringe third party intellectual property. the company has not included any such indemnification provisions in the contractual obligations table above. historically, the company has not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification obligations.
the company's restated certificate of incorporation requires it to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made, or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director or officer of the company, or by reason of serving at the request of the company as a director or officer of any other entity, subject to limited exceptions. danaher's amended and restated by-laws provide for similar indemnification rights. in addition, danaher has executed with each director and executive officer of danaher corporation an indemnification agreement which provides for substantially similar indemnification rights and under which danaher has agreed to pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such indemnifiable proceeding. while the company maintains insurance for this type of liability, a significant deductible applies to this coverage and any such liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage.
legal proceedings please refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for information regarding legal proceedings and contingencies, and for a discussion of risks related to legal proceedings and contingencies, please refer to "item 1a. risk factors."
critical accounting estimates management's discussion and analysis of the company's financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states. the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. the company bases these estimates and judgments on historical experience, the current economic environment and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results may differ materially from these estimates and judgments.
the company believes the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements. estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and (2) material changes in the estimate are reasonably likely from period to period. for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates, refer to note 1 in the company's consolidated financial statements.
accounts receivable: the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts to reflect probable credit losses inherent in its portfolio of receivables. determination of the allowances requires management to exercise judgment about the timing, frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the allowances for doubtful accounts and, therefore, net income. the allowances for doubtful accounts represent management's best estimate of the credit losses expected from the company's trade accounts, contract and finance receivable portfolios. the level of the allowances is based on many quantitative and qualitative factors including historical loss experience by receivable type, portfolio duration, delinquency trends, economic conditions and credit risk quality. the company regularly performs detailed reviews of its accounts receivable portfolio to determine if an impairment has occurred and to assess the adequacy of the allowances. if the financial condition of the company's customers were to deteriorate with a severity, frequency and/or timing different from the company's assumptions, additional allowances would be required and the company's financial statements would be adversely impacted.
inventories: the company records inventory at the lower of cost or market value. the company estimates the market value of its inventory based on assumptions of future demand and related pricing. estimating the market value of inventory is inherently uncertain because levels of demand, technological advances and pricing competition in many of the company's markets can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to circumstances beyond the company's control. if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, the company could be required to reduce the value of its inventory, which would adversely impact the company's financial statements.
56
acquired intangibles: the company's business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill, in-process research and development and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that the company may incur. refer to notes 1, 2 and 6 in the company's consolidated financial statements for a description of the company's policies relating to goodwill, acquired intangibles and acquisitions.
in performing its goodwill impairment testing, the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units primarily using a market based approach. the company estimates fair value based on multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda") determined by current trading market multiples of earnings for companies operating in businesses similar to each of the company's reporting units, in addition to recent market available sale transactions of comparable businesses. in evaluating the estimates derived by the market based approach, management makes judgments about the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and marketplace data as well as judgments about the comparability of the market proxies selected. in certain circumstances the company also estimates fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis (i.e., an income approach) in order to validate the results of the market approach. the discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth, future operating margins, discount rates and terminal values. there are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management's judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment.
as of december 31, 2014, the company had twenty-two reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. reporting units resulting from recent acquisitions generally present the highest risk of impairment. management believes the impairment risk associated with these reporting units decreases as these businesses are integrated into the company and better positioned for potential future earnings growth. the carrying value of the goodwill included in each individual reporting unit ranges from $7 million to $4.3 billion. the company's annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2014 indicated that in all instances, the fair values of the company's reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge. the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of the company's reporting units as of the annual testing date ranged from approximately 10% to approximately 1140%. in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test, the company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those values to the reporting unit carrying values. based on this hypothetical 10% decrease, the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of the company's reporting units ranged from approximately 2% to approximately 1015%.
the company reviews identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. the company also tests intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually for impairment. determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. these analyses require management to make judgments and estimates about future revenues, expenses, market conditions and discount rates related to these assets.
if actual results are not consistent with management's estimates and assumptions, goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings which would adversely affect the company's financial statements.
contingent liabilities: as discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to its business (or the business operations of previously owned entities). the company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. these assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes, the anticipated outcome of negotiations, the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims. in addition, because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to various factors, including those discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. if the reserves established by the company with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate, the company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves, which would adversely affect the company's financial statements.
revenue recognition: the company derives revenues from the sale of products and services. refer to note 1 to the company's consolidated financial statements for a description of the company's revenue recognition policies.
57
although most of the company's sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions, certain agreements contain multiple elements or non-standard terms and conditions. as a result, judgment is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the deliverables specified in these agreements should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and, if so, how the consideration should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element. the company allocates revenue to each element in the contractual arrangement based on the selling price hierarchy that, in some instances, may require the company to estimate the selling price of certain deliverables that are not sold separately or where third party evidence of pricing is not observable. the company's estimate of selling price impacts the amount and timing of revenue recognized in multiple element arrangements. the company also enters into lease arrangements with customers, which requires the company to determine whether the arrangements are operating or sales-type leases. certain of the company's lease contracts are customized for larger customers and often result in complex terms and conditions that typically require significant judgment in applying the lease accounting criteria.
if the company's judgments regarding revenue recognition prove incorrect, the company's revenues in particular periods may be adversely affected.
stock-based compensation: for a description of the company's stock-based compensation accounting practices, refer to note 17 to the company's consolidated financial statements. determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock-based payment awards require subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the awards, stock price volatility and expected forfeiture rate. the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based payment awards represent the company's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. if actual results are not consistent with management's assumptions and estimates, the company's equity-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.
pension and other post-retirement benefits: for a description of the company's pension and other post-retirement benefit accounting practices, refer to notes 10 and 11 in the company's consolidated financial statements. calculations of the amount of pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations, including assumptions regarding discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rates of salary increases, health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, and other factors. if the assumptions used in calculating pension and other post-retirement benefits costs and obligations are incorrect or if the factors underlying the assumptions change (as a result of differences in actual experience, changes in key economic indicators or other factors) the company's financial statements could be materially affected. a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rates used for the plans would have increased the u.s. net obligation by $150 million ($94 million on an after tax basis) and the non-u.s. net obligation by $138 million ($107 million on an after tax basis) from the amounts recorded in the financial statements as of december 31, 2014.
for 2014, the estimated long-term rate of return for the u.s. plan is 7.5%, and the company intends to use an assumption of 7.5% for 2015. this expected rate of return reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the expected long-term returns on equity and debt investments included in plan assets. the u.s. plan targets to invest between 60% and 70% of its assets in equity portfolios which are invested in funds that are expected to mirror broad market returns for equity securities or in assets with characteristics similar to equity investments. the balance of the asset portfolio is generally invested in bond funds. the company's non-u.s. plan assets consist of various insurance contracts, equity and debt securities as determined by the administrator of each plan. the estimated long-term rate of return for the non-u.s. plans was determined on a plan by plan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and ranged from 1.25% to 7.10%. if the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for 2014 was reduced by 50 basis points, pension expense for the u.s. and non-u.s. plans for 2014 would have increased $10 million ($6 million on an after-tax basis) and $4 million ($3 million on an after-tax basis), respectively.
for a discussion of the company's 2014 and anticipated 2015 defined benefit pension plan contributions, please see "-liquidity and capital resources - cash and cash requirements".
income taxes: for a description of the company's income tax accounting policies, refer to notes 1 and 12 to the company's consolidated financial statements. the company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized which requires management to make judgments and estimates regarding: (1) the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, (2) expected future taxable income, and (3) the impact of tax planning strategies. future changes to tax rates would also impact the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities and could have an adverse impact on the company's financial statements.
the company provides for unrecognized tax benefits when, based upon the technical merits, it is "more-likely-than-not" that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination. judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions. the company re-evaluates the technical merits of its tax positions and may recognize an uncertain tax benefit in certain circumstances, including when: (i) a tax audit is completed; (ii) applicable tax laws change, including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance; or (iii) the applicable statute of limitations expires.
58
in addition, certain of the company's tax returns are currently under review by tax authorities including in denmark (see "-results of operations - income taxes" and note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements). management believes the positions taken in these returns are in accordance with the relevant tax laws. however, the outcome of these audits is uncertain and could result in the company being required to record charges for prior year tax obligations which could have a material adverse impact to the company's financial statements, including its effective tax rate.
an increase in the company's nominal tax rate of 1.0% would have resulted in an additional income tax provision for continuing operations for the fiscal year ended december 31, 2014 of $35 million.
new accounting standards in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued accounting standards update ("asu") no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606), which impacts virtually all aspects of an entity's revenue recognition. the core principle of the new standard is that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. the standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016. management has not yet completed its assessment of the impact of the new standard, including possible transition alternatives, on the company's financial statements.

item 1a. risk factors risk factors investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk, and you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10-k. if any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer, possibly materially. in that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline.
risks related to our business our business and future net product revenues depend heavily on the success of lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor, which has not been approved by the fda or the european commission. if we are unable to obtain marketing approval for this combination therapy, if we experience material delays in receipt of marketing approval, or if reimbursement levels agreed to by third-party payors are unfavorable or do not meet the expectations of investors or public equity market analysts, our business will be materially harmed and the market price of our common stock would likely decline.
we believe that a significant portion of the value attributed to our company by investors is based on the commercial potential of lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor. in november 2014, we submitted an nda in the united states and an maa in europe for this potential combination regimen. obtaining approval of an nda or an maa is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process, and we may not be successful. obtaining marketing approval for the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor in one country or region does not ensure that we will be able to obtain marketing approval in any other country or region.
obtaining approval to market the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor will depend on many factors, including:
•   whether or not the fda and european regulatory authorities determine that the evidence gathered in well-controlled clinical trials, other clinical trials and nonclinical studies demonstrates that lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor is safe and effective as a treatment for patients with cf 12 years of age and older who have two copies of the f508del mutation in their cftr gene;
•   whether or not the fda and european regulatory authorities are satisfied that the manufacturing facilities, processes and controls for the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor are adequate, that the labeling is satisfactory and that plans for post-marketing studies, safety monitoring and risk evaluation and mitigation are sufficient; and
•   the timing and nature of the fda and ema's comments and questions regarding the nda and maa for the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor, the scheduling and recommendations of any advisory committee meeting to consider the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor, the time required to respond to the fda or ema's comments and questions and to obtain the final labeling for the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor and any other delays that may be associated with the nda and maa review process.
even if lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor is approved, the fda or european regulatory authorities, as the case may be, could require extensive warnings on the product labeling or require expensive and time-consuming clinical trials, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies or reporting as conditions of approval. if we experience material delays in obtaining marketing approval for the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor in either or both of the united states or europe, our future net product revenues and cash flows will be adversely effected. if we do not obtain approval to market the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor in the united states and europe, our business will be materially harmed.
additionally, even if the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor receives marketing approval, coverage and reimbursement may not be available and, even if it is available, the level of reimbursement may not be satisfactory. the regulations that govern pricing, coverage and reimbursement for drugs vary widely from country to country. some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. in many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing approval is granted. adverse pricing limitations or a delay in obtaining coverage and reimbursement would decrease our future net product revenues and harm our business.
24
we are incurring losses, and we may not become profitable in future periods.
we have incurred significant operating losses in each of the last three years. in the short-term, our revenues will be dependent on continued sales of kalydeco and over the longer-term, we expect our revenues will be dependent on both continued sales of kalydeco and our ability to obtain regulatory approval for, and successfully commercialize, lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor. even if we are successful in obtaining marketing approval for lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor on a timely basis, we currently do not expect to recognize revenue from lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor until at least mid-2015. our net losses are having an adverse effect on, among other things, our shareholders' equity, total assets and working capital. because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we cannot predict when we will become profitable, if ever.
we are currently substantially dependent on revenues from kalydeco, and future revenues from kalydeco are dependent, among other factors, on our ability to increase the number of patients eligible for treatment with ivacaftor.
until we obtain regulatory approval for lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor, we expect to be substantially dependent on revenues from kalydeco. in 2012, we obtained approval to market kalydeco for the treatment of patients with cf six years of age and older with the g551d mutation in the cftr gene. since this time, we have sought to expand the number of patients eligible for treatment with kalydeco. in february 2014, the fda approved kalydeco for the treatment of patients with cf six years of age and older who have one of eight other mutations in their cftr gene, which were studied in our first phase 3 label-expansion clinical trial for ivacaftor. in july 2014, the european commission approved kalydeco for this patient group. in december 2014, the fda approved kalydeco for the treatment of patients six years of age and older who have the r117h in their cftr gene.
in order to further expand the market for ivacaftor, we need to demonstrate that ivacaftor is safe and effective in additional patient populations. we have completed a phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate ivacaftor as a treatment for children with cf two to five years of age with specific gating mutations in their cftr gene, including the g551d mutation, and have submitted an nda to the fda and an maa line extension application to the ema based on this clinical trial. we also have submitted a maa variation to the ema for ivacaftor for patients with cf 18 years of age and older with the r117h mutation in their cftr gene.
these clinical trials and our discussions with regulatory authorities are subject to the same risks and uncertainties that are described in these risk factors with respect to the development of our drug candidates. there can be no assurance that the results from our clinical trials of ivacaftor or the data included in our submissions to regulatory authorities will be sufficient to obtain approval for use of ivacaftor in additional indications or that we will be successful in obtaining reimbursement for the use of kalydeco in additional indications, if approved.
if our competitors bring drugs with superior product profiles to market, our drugs may not be competitive and our revenues could decline.
kalydeco and any drugs we develop in the future may not be able to compete effectively with marketed drugs or new drugs that may be developed by competitors. there are many other companies developing drugs for the same indications that we are pursuing. in order to compete successfully in these areas, we must demonstrate improved safety, efficacy and/or tolerability, and ease of manufacturing, and gain and maintain market acceptance over competing drugs. many of our competitors, including major pharmaceutical companies such as abbvie, bristol-myers squibb, gilead, johnson & johnson, merck, novartis, pfizer, sanofi and roche, possess substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we possess. potential competitors also include other public and private companies, academic institutions, government agencies, other public and private research organizations and charitable venture philanthropy organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and/or establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. as an example, we experienced a rapid decline in the number of patients being treated with incivek in 2013 and 2014 as new medicines for the treatment of hcv infection neared approval and were ultimately approved and became the accepted standard of care. despite the initial success of incivek, incivek only resulted in significant net product revenues during 2011, 2012 and 2013.
mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. smaller and other early-stage companies also may prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. these third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial
25
sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
a number of companies are seeking to identify and develop drug candidates for the treatment of cf, including novartis, pfizer, genzyme, which is a division of sanofi, and proqr therapeutics b.v., and several private companies. our competitors have research and development programs directed at identifying cftr potentiators, cftr correctors and drug candidates with other mechanisms of action that seek to address the underlying cause of cf, and our success in rapidly developing and commercializing kalydeco and developing and potentially commercializing lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor may increase the resources that our competitors allocate to the development of these potential treatments for cf. if one or more competing therapies are successfully developed as a treatment for patients with cf, our revenues from kalydeco, lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor, if approved, and/or other compounds, if then approved, could face competitive pressures.
if we discover safety issues with any of our products or if we fail to comply with continuing u.s. and applicable foreign regulations, commercialization efforts for the product could be negatively affected, the approved product could lose its approval or sales could be suspended, and our business could be materially harmed.
our products are subject to continuing regulatory oversight, including the review of additional safety information. drugs are more widely used by patients once approval has been obtained and therefore side-effects and other problems may be observed after approval that were not seen or anticipated, or were not as prevalent or severe, during pre-approval clinical trials or nonclinical studies. for example, in december 2012, we updated the incivek label in the united states to include a boxed warning stating that fatal and non-fatal serious skin reactions have been reported in patients taking incivek combination treatment. the subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with a product could negatively affect commercial sales of the product, result in restrictions on the product or lead to the withdrawal of the product from the market. the reporting of adverse safety events involving our products or public speculation about such events could cause our stock price to decline or experience periods of volatility.
if we or our collaborators fail to comply with applicable continuing regulatory requirements, we or our collaborators may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals for specific products, product recalls and seizures, operating restrictions and/or criminal prosecutions. in addition, the manufacturers we engage to make our products and the manufacturing facilities in which our products are made are subject to periodic review and inspection by the fda and foreign regulatory authorities. if problems are identified during the review or inspection of these manufacturers or manufacturing facilities, it could result in our inability to use the facility to make our product or a determination that inventories are not safe for commercial sale.
if physicians, patients and third-party payors do not accept our drugs, we may be unable to generate significant revenues in future periods.
our drugs may not gain or maintain market acceptance among physicians and patients. effectively marketing our drugs and any of our drug candidates, if approved, requires substantial efforts, both prior to launch and after approval. physicians may elect not to prescribe our drugs, and patients may elect not to request or take them, for a variety of reasons including:
•   prevalence and severity of adverse side-effects;
•   lack of reimbursement availability from third-party payors;
•   lower demonstrated efficacy, safety and/or tolerability compared to other drugs;
•   lack of cost-effectiveness;
•   a decision to wait for the approval of other therapies in development that have significant perceived advantages over our drug;
•   convenience and ease of administration;
•   other potential advantages of alternative treatment methods; and
•   ineffective sales, marketing and/or distribution support.
26
if our drugs fail to achieve or maintain market acceptance, we will not be able to generate significant revenues in future periods.
government and other third-party payors seek to contain costs of health care through legislative and other means. if they fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement rates for our products, our revenues will be harmed.
in both domestic and foreign markets, our sales of products depend in part upon the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. third-party payors include government health programs such as medicare and medicaid in the united states and the national health care systems in many international markets, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. the trend in the u.s. health care industry and elsewhere is cost containment and efforts of third-party payors to contain or reduce health care costs that may adversely affect our ability to establish or maintain appropriate prices for our products or any drugs that we may develop and commercialize. in certain foreign markets, pricing or profitability of therapeutic and other pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control. reimbursement agencies in europe are often more conservative than those in the united states and the reimbursement process is often slower since reimbursement decisions are made on a country-by-country basis. in the united states, there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental control as currently exists in europe. the aca requires discounts under the medicare drug benefit program and increased the rebates paid by pharmaceutical companies on drugs covered by medicaid. the aca also imposes an annual fee, which increases annually, on sales by branded pharmaceutical manufacturers.
in addition, third-party payors attempt to contain health care costs by demanding price discounts or rebates and limiting both the types and variety of drugs that they will cover and the amounts that they will pay for drugs. as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our products. we might need to conduct post-marketing studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products or any other future products to such payors' satisfaction. such studies might require us to commit a significant amount of management's time and our financial and other resources. our products might not ultimately be considered cost-effective. adequate third-party reimbursement might not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
reimbursement rates vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on payments allowed for lower-cost products that already are reimbursed, may be incorporated into existing payments for other products or services and may reflect budgetary constraints and/or imperfections in the data used to calculate these rates. net prices for products are reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government health care programs and privately-negotiated discounts. while we have implemented policies in an effort to comply with mandated reimbursement rates, the u.s. federal government, state governments and private payors frequently pursue actions against pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies alleging that the companies have overstated prices in order to inflate reimbursement rates. any such action could adversely affect the pricing of and revenues from our products. additionally, in the united states and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals and initiatives to change the health care system in ways that could affect our ability to sell products. some of these proposed and implemented reforms have resulted, or could result, in reduced reimbursement rates for our current or future products, which would adversely affect our business, operations and financial results.
specialty pharmaceuticals are drugs that are prescribed by specialist physicians to treat rare or life-threatening conditions and typically address smaller patient populations. each of our products is a specialty pharmaceutical product, and our research and development programs are primarily focused on developing additional specialty pharmaceutical products. the increasing availability and use of innovative specialty pharmaceuticals, combined with their relative higher cost as compared to other types of pharmaceutical products, is beginning to generate significant third-party payor interest in developing cost-containment strategies targeted to this sector. government regulations in both non-u.s. and u.s markets could limit the prices that can be charged for our products and may limit our commercial opportunity. the increasing use of health technology assessments in markets around the world and the financial challenges faced by many governments may lead to significant adverse effects on our business.
any legislation or regulatory changes or relaxation of laws that restrict imports of drugs from other countries also could reduce the net price we receive for our products.
27
if we market any of our products in a manner that violates applicable health care laws, including fraud and abuse laws, laws prohibiting off-label promotion, disclosure laws or other similar laws, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties.
we are subject to health care fraud and abuse laws, such as the federal false claims act and the anti-kickback provisions of the federal social security act, laws prohibiting off-label product promotion and other similar laws and regulations both in united states and in non-u.s. markets. while we have a corporate compliance program designed to actively identify, prevent and mitigate risk through the implementation of compliance policies and systems and the promotion of a culture of compliance, if we are found not to be in full compliance with these laws our business could be materially harmed.
the federal anti-kickback law prohibits knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the ordering, furnishing, arranging for or recommending of an item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a federal health care program, such as medicare or medicaid. the federal statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, patients, purchasers and formulary managers on the other hand, and therefore constrains our marketing practices and our various service arrangements with physicians, including physicians who make clinical decisions to use our products. although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and courts generally will apply a "one purpose test" and find a violation of the law if any part of the intent in providing the remuneration was to induce referrals, even if it also was intended to compensate for professional services or other legitimate purposes.
federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of alleged promotional and marketing activities, such as providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product; reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then used by federal programs to set reimbursement rates; engaging in promotion for uses that the fda has not approved, known as "off-label" uses, that caused claims to be submitted to medicaid for non-covered off-label uses; submitting inflated "best price" information to the medicaid rebate program; and certain manufacturing-related violations. the scope of this and other laws may expand in ways that make compliance more difficult and expensive.
although physicians are permitted, based on their medical judgment, to prescribe products for indications other than those approved by the fda, manufacturers are prohibited from promoting their products for such off-label uses. we market kalydeco for patients six years of age and older with cf who have specific mutations in their cftr gene and provide promotional materials and training programs to physicians regarding the use of kalydeco in these patient populations. if the fda determines that our promotional materials, training or other activities constitute off-label promotion, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or other activities, conduct corrective advertising or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions, including the issuance of a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine and criminal penalties. it also is possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they believe that the alleged improper promotion led to the submission and payment of claims for an off-label use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. even if it is later determined we were not in violation of these laws, we may be faced with negative publicity, incur significant expenses defending our actions and have to divert significant management resources from other matters.
also applicable to some of our practices is hipaa and its implementing regulations, which created federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements relating to health care matters and which also imposes certain regulatory and contractual requirements regarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.
the majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. in addition, certain states have laws governing the privacy of certain health information, which may differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by hipaa, complicating compliance efforts. sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties from private causes of action, exclusion of a pharmaceutical manufacturer's products from reimbursement under government programs and criminal fines. even if we are not determined
28
to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could harm our business.
in recent years, several states and localities have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state or make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials, health care provider payments and other activities. additionally, as part of the aca, the federal government recently enacted the physician payment sunshine act provisions. the physician payment sunshine act provisions require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report annually to the secretary of hhs payments or other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals. we were required to begin reporting certain information with respect to such payments in june 2014. we also now have similar reporting obligations in certain european countries and medicines australia and the european federation of pharmaceutical industries and associations recently adopted codes that will require us to begin reporting such information in australia in 2015 and throughout the european union in 2016. we expended significant efforts to establish, and are continuing to devote significant resources to maintain and enhance, systems and processes in order to comply with these regulations. failure to comply with the reporting requirements would result in significant civil monetary penalties. the aca also includes various provisions designed to strengthen significantly fraud and abuse enforcement, such as increased funding for enforcement efforts and the lowering of the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback statute and criminal health care fraud statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it.
on january 1, 2015, the ema adopted a new policy on publication of clinical data whereby it will publish clinical reports submitted as part of maas for drugs. the policy applies to all clinical reports submitted after january 1, 2015 and the reports will be released as soon as a decision on the application has been made by the ema. in addition to the general compliance cost associated with the new policy, the ability of third-parties to review the raw data from our clinical trials may increase the risk of patient confidentiality breaches and could result in enhanced scrutiny of our clinical trials results. such scrutiny could result in misconceptions being spread about our drugs and drug candidates, even if the underlying analysis of such review turns out to be flawed. these publications could also result in the disclosure of information to our competitors that we might otherwise deem confidential, which could harm our competitive position.
if our past or present operations are found to be in violation of any such laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from federal health care programs and/or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. the risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are subject to a variety of interpretations. any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against them, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management's attention from the operation of our business.
the sales and marketing practices of our industry have been the subject of increased scrutiny from governmental entities in the united sates and other countries in which we market our products, and we believe that this trend will continue. we have in place policies to govern how we may retain health care professionals as consultants that reflect the current climate on this issue and are providing training on these policies. any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against them, also could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management's attention from the operation of our business.
the increasing use of social media platforms presents new risks and challenges.
social media increasingly is being used by third parties to communicate about our products and drug candidates and the diseases our therapies are designed to treat. we believe that members of the cf community may be more active on social media as compared to other patient populations due to the demographics of this patient population. social media practices in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are evolving, which creates uncertainty and risk of noncompliance with regulations applicable to our business. for example, patients may use social media platforms to comment on the effectiveness of, or adverse experiences with, a drug or a drug candidate, which could result in reporting obligations. in addition, there is a risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us on any social networking website. if any of these events were to occur or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could incur liability, face restrictive regulatory actions or incur other harm to our business.
29
risks related to development, clinical testing and regulation of our products and drug candidates our drug candidates remain subject to clinical testing and regulatory approval. if we are unable to successfully develop additional drug candidates, our business will be materially harmed.
our business depends upon the successful development and commercialization of drug candidates. these drug candidates are in various stages of development and must satisfy rigorous standards of safety and efficacy before they can be approved for sale by the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. to satisfy these standards, we must allocate resources among our various development programs and must engage in expensive and lengthy testing of our drug candidates. discovery and development efforts for new pharmaceutical products, including new combination therapies, are resource-intensive and may take 10 to 15 years or longer for each drug candidate. despite our efforts, our drug candidates may not:
•   offer therapeutic or other improvement over existing competitive drugs;
•   be proven safe and effective in clinical trials;
•   meet applicable regulatory standards;
•   be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at acceptable costs; or
•   if approved for commercial sale, be successfully marketed as pharmaceutical products.
we have recently completed and/or have ongoing or planned clinical trials for ivacaftor, ivacaftor in combination with lumacaftor, and ivacaftor in combination with vx-661. the strength of our company's product portfolio and pipeline will depend in large part upon the outcomes of these clinical trials and our ability to develop and commercialize combination treatments for cf that include ivacaftor in combination with (i) lumacaftor or vx-661 and/or (ii) a next-generation cftr corrector compound. results of our clinical trials and findings from our nonclinical studies, including toxicology findings in nonclinical studies conducted concurrently with clinical trials, could lead to abrupt changes in our development activities, including the possible cessation of development activities associated with a particular drug candidate or program. moreover, clinical data are often susceptible of varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their drug candidates performed satisfactorily in clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their drug candidate. furthermore, results from our clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the fda or other regulatory authorities for approval of a drug candidate.
many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including our company, have suffered significant setbacks in later-stage clinical trials even after achieving promising results in earlier-stage clinical trials. accordingly, the results from completed preclinical studies and clinical trials may not be replicated in later clinical trials, and ongoing clinical trials for our drug candidates may not be predictive of the results we may obtain in later-stage clinical trials or of the likelihood of approval of a drug candidate for commercial sale. in addition, from time to time we report interim data from our clinical trials. interim data from a clinical trial may not be predictive of final results from the clinical trial.
if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval, we will be unable to commercialize our drug candidates.
the time required to complete clinical trials and to satisfy the fda and other countries' regulatory review processes is uncertain and typically takes many years. our analysis of data obtained from nonclinical and clinical activities is subject to confirmation and interpretation by regulatory authorities, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. we also may encounter unanticipated delays or increased costs due to government regulation from future legislation or administrative action or changes in governmental policy during the period of drug development, clinical trials and governmental regulatory review.
any failure to obtain regulatory approvals for a drug candidate would prevent us from commercializing that drug candidate. any delay in obtaining required regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our ability to successfully commercialize a drug candidate. furthermore, any regulatory approval to market a drug may be subject to limitations that we do not expect on the indicated uses for which we may market the drug. any such limitations could reduce the size of the market for the drug.
we also are subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing authorization, pricing and third-party reimbursement. non-u.s. jurisdictions have different approval
30
procedures than those required by the fda, and these jurisdictions may impose additional testing requirements for our drug candidates. the foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with the fda approval process described above, as well as risks attributable to the satisfaction of foreign requirements. approval by the fda does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities outside the united states and approval by a foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by the fda. in addition, although the fda may accept data from clinical trials conducted outside the united states, acceptance of this data is subject to conditions imposed by the fda. for example, the clinical trial must be well designed and conducted and performed by qualified investigators in accordance with ethical principles. the trial population also must adequately represent the u.s. population, and the data must be applicable to the u.s. population and u.s. medical practice in ways that the fda deems clinically meaningful. in addition, while these clinical trials are subject to the applicable local laws, fda acceptance of the data will depend on its determination that the trials also complied with all applicable u.s. laws and regulations. if the fda does not accept the data from any trial that we conduct outside the united states, it would likely result in the need for additional trials, which would be costly and time-consuming and delay or permanently halt our development of the applicable drug candidate.
we have developed multiple manufacturing process for co-formulated lumacaftor/ivacaftor, and any failure to validate our manufacturing process could adversely affect our ability to commercially launch lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor.
we have developed several manufacturing processes to produce commercial quantities of co-formulated lumacaftor/ivacaftor. in addition to a traditional batch manufacturing process, we have developed a continuous manufacturing process that connects the processes used in traditional batch manufacturing. we have not previously designed, implemented or utilized a continuous manufacturing process to produce commercial quantities of a pharmaceutical product and believe that we are the first company to seek approval for an nda or an maa using this method of manufacturing. as a result, it may be more difficult to satisfy regulators that our process is capable of consistently producing commercial quantities of co-formulated lumacaftor/ivacaftor and that our methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the final products are sufficient. while we believe that we could manufacture sufficient co-formulated lumacaftor/ivacaftor using either of our manufacturing processes, a failure to establish and validate our manufacturing processes for co-formulated lumacaftor/ivacaftor or any disruption in our supply chain could increase costs or adversely affect our ability to commercially launch lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in a timely manner.
if clinical trials are prolonged or delayed, our development timelines for the affected development program could be extended, our costs to develop the drug candidate could increase and the competitive position of the drug candidate could be adversely affected.
we cannot predict whether or not we will encounter problems with any of our completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials that will cause us or regulatory authorities to delay or suspend clinical trials, or delay the analysis of data from our completed or ongoing clinical trials. among the factors that could delay our development programs are:
•   ongoing discussions with the fda or comparable foreign authorities regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials and the number of clinical trials we must conduct;
•   delays in enrolling volunteers or patients into clinical trials, including as a result of low numbers of patients that meet the eligibility criteria for the trial;
•   a lower than anticipated retention rate of volunteers or patients in clinical trials;
•   the need to repeat clinical trials as a result of inconclusive results, unforeseen complications in testing or clinical investigator error;
•   inadequate supply or deficient quality of drug candidate materials or other materials necessary for the conduct of our clinical trials;
•   unfavorable fda or foreign regulatory authority inspection and review of a manufacturing facility that supplied clinical trial materials or its relevant manufacturing records or a clinical trial site or records of any clinical or preclinical investigation;
•   unfavorable scientific results from clinical trials;
31
•   serious and unexpected drug-related side-effects experienced by participants in our clinical trials or by participants in clinical trials being conducted by our competitors to evaluate drug candidates with similar mechanisms of action or structures to drug candidates that we are developing;
•   favorable results in testing of our competitors' drug candidates, or fda or foreign regulatory authority approval of our competitors' drug candidates; or
•   action by the fda or a foreign regulatory authority to place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on a trial or compound or deeming the clinical trial conduct as problematic.
our ability to enroll patients in our clinical trials in sufficient numbers and on a timely basis is subject to a number of factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the availability of effective treatments for the relevant disease, the number of other clinical trials ongoing and competing for patients in the same indication and the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial. in addition, patients may drop out of our clinical trials or may be lost to follow-up medical evaluation after treatment ends, and this could impair the validity or statistical significance of the trials. delays in patient enrollment or unforeseen drop-out rates may result in increased costs and longer development times.
we, our collaborators, the fda or other applicable regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials of a drug candidate at any time if we or they believe the healthy volunteers or patients participating in such clinical trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or for other reasons. for example, in july 2013, the fda placed a partial clinical hold on vx-135, a drug candidate we were developing for the treatment of patients with hepatitis c virus infection. any such suspension could materially adversely affect the development of a particular drug candidate and our business.
if our processes and systems are not compliant with regulatory requirements, we could be subject to restrictions on marketing our products or could be delayed in submitting regulatory filings seeking approvals for our drug candidates.
we have a number of regulated processes and systems that are required to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our drugs and drug candidates. these processes and systems are subject to continual review and periodic inspection by the fda and other regulatory bodies. in addition, the clinical research organizations and other third parties that we work with in our non-clinical studies and clinical trials and our oversight of such parties are subject to similar reviews and periodic inspection by the fda and other regulatory bodies. if compliance issues are identified at any point in the development and approval process, we may experience delays in filing for regulatory approval for our drug candidates, or delays in obtaining regulatory approval after filing. any later discovery of previously unknown problems or safety issues with approved drugs or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in restrictions on such drugs or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of drugs from the market, the imposition of civil or criminal penalties or a refusal by the fda and/or other regulatory bodies to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new drugs or supplements to approved applications, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. in addition, we are a party to agreements that transfer responsibility for complying with specified regulatory requirements, such as filing and maintenance of marketing authorizations and safety reporting or compliance with manufacturing requirements, to our collaborators and third-party manufacturers. if our collaborators or third-party manufacturers do not fulfill these regulatory obligations, any drugs for which we or they obtain approval may be subject to later restrictions on manufacturing or sale, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
risks related to collaborations and other business development activities our ability to execute on our long-term strategy depends in part on our ability to acquire rights to additional drugs, drug candidates and other technologies that have the potential to add to our pipeline or provide us with new commercial opportunities.
in order to achieve our long-term business objectives, our strategy is to supplement our internal pipeline by acquiring rights to additional drugs, drug candidates and other technologies that have the potential to provide us with new commercial opportunities. in particular, we are focusing on drug candidates for the treatment of patients with cf and other third-party drug candidates that could be developed for specialty markets. we may not be able to acquire, in-license or otherwise obtain rights to additional drugs, drug candidates or other technologies on acceptable terms or at all. we have faced and will continue to face significant competition for these types of drugs, drug candidates and other technologies from a variety of other companies with interests in the specialty pharmaceutical marketplace, many of which have significantly more financial resources and experience in business development activities than we have. in addition, non-profit organizations may be
32
willing to provide capital to the companies that control additional drugs, drug candidates or technologies, which may provide incentives for companies to advance these drugs, drug candidates or technologies independently. because of these competitive pressures, the cost of acquiring, in-licensing or otherwise obtaining rights to such drugs, drug candidates or other technologies has grown dramatically in recent years and may be at levels that we cannot afford or that we believe are not justified by market potential. this competition is most intense for approved drugs and late-stage drug candidates, which have the lowest risk and would have the most immediate effect on our financial performance.
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of potential acquisitions or licenses to businesses, drugs, drug candidates and other technologies, and the integration following any such acquisition or license may disrupt our business and management.
if we acquire a business or the rights to additional drugs, drug candidates or other technologies, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any such transaction, each of which involves numerous risks. these risks include:
•   failure to successfully further develop the acquired or licensed drugs or technology or to achieve strategic objectives, including successfully developing and commercializing the drugs, drug candidates or technologies that we acquire or license;
•   inadequate or unfavorable data from clinical trials evaluating the acquired or licensed drug or drug candidates;
•   entry into markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience or where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions;
•   disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and employees from other opportunities and challenges;
•   potential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired company, or acquired or licensed product or technology, including but not limited to, problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges with respect to intellectual property, product quality, safety, accounting practices, employee, customer or third party relations and other known and unknown liabilities;
•   liability for activities of the acquired company or licensor before the acquisition or license, including intellectual property infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities;
•   exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of an acquisition or license, including but not limited to, claims from terminated employees, customers, former equity holders or other third-parties;
•   difficulty in integrating the drugs, drug candidates, technologies, business operations and personnel of an acquired company; and
•   difficulties in the integration of the acquired company's departments, systems, including accounting, human resource and other administrative systems, technologies, books and records, and procedures, as well as in maintaining uniform standards, controls, including internal control over financial reporting required by the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 and related procedures and policies.
acquisitions and licensing arrangements are inherently risky, and ultimately, if we do not complete an announced acquisition or license transaction or integrate an acquired business, or an acquired or licensed drug, drug candidate or other technology successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition or license to the extent anticipated and the perception of the effectiveness of our management team and our company may suffer in the marketplace. additionally, we may later incur impairment charges related to assets acquired in any such transaction. for example, we acquired or licensed several drug candidates for the treatment of hcv infection, but due to adverse clinical data regarding these drug candidates and competitive pressures, we incurred significant costs and impairment charges but did not realize the expected benefits from these transactions. in addition, even if we achieve the long-term benefits associated with strategic transactions, our expenses and short-term costs may increase materially and adversely affect our liquidity and short-term net income (loss). future licenses or acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence
33
of debt, the creation of contingent liabilities, impairment expenses related to goodwill, and impairment or amortization expenses related to other intangible assets, which could harm our financial condition.
we face risks in connection with existing and future collaborations with respect to the development, manufacture and commercialization of our products and drug candidates.
the risks that we face in connection with our current and any future collaborations include the following:
•   our collaborators may change the focus of their development and commercialization efforts or may have insufficient resources to effectively develop our drug candidates. the ability of some of our products and drug candidates to reach their potential could be limited if collaborators decrease or fail to increase development or commercialization efforts related to those products or drug candidates. our collaboration agreements provide our collaborators with a level of discretion in determining the amount and timing of efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations.
•   any future collaboration agreements may have the effect of limiting the areas of research and development that we may pursue, either alone or in collaboration with third parties.
•   collaborators may develop and commercialize, either alone or with others, drugs that are similar to or competitive with the drugs or drug candidates that are the subject of their collaborations with us.
•   disagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development, might cause delays or termination of the research, development or commercialization of drug candidates, might lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to drug candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration. any such disagreements would divert management attention and resources and be time-consuming and expensive.
•   collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation.
•   collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability.
•   investigations and/or compliance or enforcement actions against a collaborator, which may expose us to indirect liability as a result of our partnership with such collaborator.
•   our collaboration agreements are subject to termination under various circumstances.
additionally, if a collaborator were to be involved in a business combination, it might deemphasize or terminate the development or commercialization of any drug candidate licensed to it by us. if one of our collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may find it more difficult to attract new collaborators and our perception in the business and financial communities could be harmed.
we may not be able to attract collaborators or external funding for the development and commercialization of certain of our drug candidates.
as part of our ongoing strategy, we may seek additional collaborative arrangements or external funding for certain of our development programs and/or seek to expand existing collaborations to cover additional commercialization and/or development activities. we have a number of research programs and early-stage clinical development programs, some of which are being developed in collaboration with a third party. for example, in june 2014, we granted janssen pharmaceuticals, inc. an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize vx-787, a drug candidate discovered by us for the treatment of influenza. at any time, we may determine that in order to continue development of a drug candidate or program or successfully commercialize a drug we need to identify a collaborator or amend or expand an existing collaboration. whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator's resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator's evaluation of a number of factors. those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the fda or similar regulatory authorities outside the united states, the potential market for the subject drug candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such drug candidate to patients, the
34
potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of the applicable intellectual property, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge, and industry and market conditions generally. potentially, and depending on the circumstances, we may desire that a collaborator either agree to fund portions of a drug development program led by us, or agree to provide all of the funding and directly lead the development and commercialization of a program. no assurance can be given that any efforts we make to seek additional collaborative arrangements will be successfully completed on a timely basis or at all. if we elect to fund and undertake development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. if we are unable to enter into acceptable collaborative relationships, one or more of our development programs could be delayed or terminated and the possibility of our receiving a return on our investment in the program could be impaired.
risks related to third-party manufacturing and reliance on third parties we depend on third-party manufacturers to manufacture our products and the materials we require for our clinical trials. we may not be able to maintain these relationships and could experience supply disruptions outside of our control.
we rely on a worldwide network of third-party manufacturers to manufacture and distribute our drugs for commercial use and our drug candidates for clinical trials. as a result of our reliance on these third-party manufacturers and suppliers, including a sole source supplier of one of the components in our products, we could be subject to significant supply disruptions outside of our control. our supply chain for sourcing raw materials and manufacturing drug product ready for distribution is a multi-step international endeavor. third-party contract manufacturers, including some in china, supply us with raw materials, and convert these raw materials into drug substance and convert the drug substance into final dosage form. establishing and managing this global supply chain requires a significant financial commitment and the creation and maintenance of numerous third-party contractual relationships. although we attempt to manage the business relationships with companies in our supply chain, we do not have control over their operations.
supply disruptions may result from a number of factors, including shortages in product raw materials, labor or technical difficulties, regulatory inspections or restrictions, shipping or customs delays or any other performance failure by any third-party manufacturer on which we rely. any supply disruptions could disrupt sales of our products and/or the timing of our clinical trials. furthermore, we may be required to modify our production methods to permit us to economically manufacture our drugs for sale and our drug candidates for clinical trials. these modifications may require us to re-evaluate our resources and the resources of our third-party manufacturers, which could result in abrupt changes in our production methods and supplies.
we require a supply of ivacaftor for commercial sale (as kalydeco), and if we successfully obtain marketing approval for lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor, we will require a commercial supply of lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor. we also require a supply of ivacaftor, lumacaftor, vx-661 and our other drug candidates for use in our clinical trials. we obtain ivacaftor and lumacaftor (and the combinations thereof) to meet our commercial and clinical supply needs through a third-party manufacturing network. our supply chain for kalydeco and lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor includes a sole source supplier of one of the components in our products. a disruption in the commercial supply of kalydeco, or lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor, if we successfully obtain marketing approval for such combination, would have a significant effect on patients, our business and our product revenues. a disruption in the clinical supply of drug products could delay the completion of clinical trials and affect timelines for regulatory filings. there can be no assurance that we will be able to establish and maintain secondary manufacturers for all of our ivacaftor or lumacaftor supply needs on a timely basis or at all.
in the course of providing its services, a contract manufacturer may develop process technology related to the manufacture of our products or drug candidates that the manufacturer owns, either independently or jointly with us. this would increase our reliance on that manufacturer or require us to obtain a license from that manufacturer in order to have our products or drug candidates manufactured by other suppliers utilizing the same process.
we rely on third parties to conduct certain pre-clinical work and clinical trials, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet established deadlines for the completion of such studies and/or trials or failing to satisfy regulatory requirements.
we rely on third parties such as contract research organizations to help manage certain pre-clinical work and our clinical trials and on medical institutions and clinical investigators to enroll qualified patients and conduct our clinical trials. our
35
reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities but does not relieve us of our responsibilities. for example, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the clinical trial. moreover, the fda requires us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as good laboratory practices and good clinical practices for conducting, recording and reporting the results of pre-clinical and clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. if these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be required to replace them. although we believe that there are a number of other third-party contractors we could engage to continue these activities, it may result in a delay of the affected clinical trial or drug development program. if clinical trials are not conducted in accordance with our contractual expectations or regulatory requirements, action by regulatory authorities might significantly and adversely affect the conduct or progress of these clinical trials or in specific circumstances might result in a requirement that a clinical trial be redone. accordingly, our efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for and commercialize our drug candidates could be delayed.
risks related to intellectual property if our patents do not protect our drugs, or our drugs infringe third-party patents, we could be subject to litigation and substantial liabilities.
we have numerous issued patents and pending patent applications in the united states, as well as counterparts in other countries. our success will depend, in significant part, on our ability to obtain and defend u.s. and foreign patents covering our drugs, their uses and our processes, to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. we cannot be certain that any patents will issue from our pending patent applications or, even if patents issue or have issued, that the issued claims will provide us with any adequate protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable.
due to evolving legal standards relating to the patentability, validity and enforceability of patents covering pharmaceutical inventions and the scope of claims made under these patents, our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce patents is uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. recent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents in the u.s. the leahy-smith america invents act, or the leahy-smith act, includes a number of significant changes to united states patent law. these include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. the united states patent office recently developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the leahy-smith act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the leahy-smith act, and in particular, the first to file provisions, only became effective in march 2013. the first to file provisions limit the rights of an inventor who is the first to invent an invention but is not the first to file an application claiming that invention. u.s. and foreign patent applications typically are maintained in confidence for a period of time after they initially are filed with the applicable patent office. consequently, we cannot be certain that we were the first to invent, or the first to file patent applications on, our products or drug candidates or their use. if a third party also has filed a u.s. patent application relating to our drugs or drug candidates, their uses, or a similar invention, we may have to participate in interference proceedings to determine priority of invention and could lose our patent position. for applications governed by the lahey-smith act, if a third-party has an earlier filed u.s. patent application relating to our drugs or drug candidates, their uses, or a similar invention, we may be unable to obtain an issued patent from our application.
the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability. our patents may be challenged by third parties, resulting in the patent being deemed invalid, unenforceable or narrowed in scope, or the third party may circumvent any such issued patents. also, our pending patent applications may not issue, and we may not receive any additional patents. our patents might not contain claims that are sufficiently broad to prevent others from utilizing our technologies. for instance, the issued patents relating to our drugs or drug candidates may be limited to a particular molecule or molecules and may not cover similar molecules that have similar clinical properties. consequently, our competitors may independently develop competing products that do not infringe our patents or other intellectual property. in addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future products.
the laws of many foreign jurisdictions do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the united states and many companies in our segment of the pharmaceutical industry have encountered significant difficulties in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. if we encounter such difficulties in protecting or are otherwise
36
precluded from effectively protecting our intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions, our business could be substantially harmed.
because of the extensive time required for the discovery, development, testing and regulatory review of drug candidates, it is possible that, a patent may expire before a drug candidate can be commercialized, or a patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization of such drug candidate resulting in a minimal, if any, period of patent exclusivity. to the extent our drug candidates are not commercialized significantly ahead of the expiration date of any applicable patent, or to the extent we have no patent protection on such drug candidates, then, to the extent available we would rely on other forms of exclusivity, such as regulatory exclusivity provided by the fdca and its counterpart agencies in various jurisdictions, and/or orphan drug exclusivity.
uncertainty over intellectual property in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry has been the source of litigation and other disputes, which is inherently costly and unpredictable.
there is considerable uncertainty within our industry about the validity, scope and enforceability of many issued patents in the united states and elsewhere in the world, and, to date, the law and practice remains in substantial flux both in the agencies that grant patents and in the courts. we cannot currently determine the ultimate scope and validity of patents which may be granted to third parties in the future or which patents might be asserted as being infringed by the manufacture, use and sale of our products.
there has been, and we expect that there may continue to be, significant litigation in the industry regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. litigation, arbitrations, administrative proceedings and other legal actions with private parties and governmental authorities concerning patents and other intellectual property rights may be protracted, expensive and distracting to management. competitors may sue us as a way of delaying the introduction of our drugs or to remove our drugs from the market. any litigation, including litigation related to abbreviated new drug applications, or anda, interference proceedings to determine priority of inventions, derivations proceedings, inter partes review, oppositions to patents in foreign countries, litigation against our collaborators or similar actions, may be costly and time consuming and could harm our business. we expect that litigation may be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our proprietary rights. litigation may be necessary in other instances to determine the validity, scope or non-infringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our products. ultimately, the outcome of such litigation could adversely affect the validity and scope of our patent or other proprietary rights, hinder our ability to manufacture and market our products, or result in the assessment of significant monetary damages against us that may exceed amounts, if any, accrued in our financial statements.
to the extent that valid present or future third-party patents or other intellectual property rights cover our drugs, drug candidates or technologies, we or our strategic collaborators may seek licenses or other agreements from the holders of such rights in order to avoid or settle legal claims. such licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, which may hinder our ability to, or prevent us from being able to, manufacture and market our drugs. payments under any licenses that we are able to obtain would reduce our profits derived from the covered products.
we may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that our employees or we have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.
many of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee's former employer. litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.
in addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. our and their assignment agreements may not be self-executing or may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.
37
if we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.
risks related to our operations if we fail to manage our operations effectively, our business may suffer.
we have expanded and are continuing to expand our global operations and capabilities, which has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our management and our operational, research and development and financial infrastructure. to effectively manage our business, we need to:
•   implement and clearly communicate our corporate-wide strategies;
•   enhance our operational and financial infrastructure, including our controls over records and information;
•   enhance our operational, financial and management processes, including our cross-functional decision-making processes and our budget prioritization systems;
•   train and manage our global employee base;
•   transition from a u.s.-centric company into an organization capable of developing and commercializing multiple drug candidates in international markets; and
•   enhance our compliance and legal resources.
risks associated with operating in foreign countries could materially adversely affect our business.
we have expanded our international operations over the past several years in order to market kalydeco, prepare to market lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor, if approved, and expand our research and development capabilities. in 2014, a substantial portion of our revenues and expenses were associated with our foreign operations. new laws and industry codes in the european union and elsewhere have recently expanded transparency requirements regarding payments and transfers of value as well as patient-level clinical trial data, which will add to our compliance costs and expose us to potential sanctions for failing to meet the enhanced reporting demands in these jurisdictions. in addition, a significant portion of our commercial supply chain, including sourcing of raw materials and manufacturing, is located in china and the european union. consequently, we are, and will continue to be, subject to risks related to operating in foreign countries. risks associated with conducting operations in foreign countries include:
•   differing regulatory requirements for drug approvals and regulation of approved drugs in foreign countries;
•   collectibility of accounts receivable;
•   unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;
•   economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;
•   complying with local laws and regulations, which are interpreted and enforced differently across jurisdictions and which can change significantly over time;
•   foreign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;
•   foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in reduced revenues or increased operating expenses, and other obligations incident to doing business or operating in another country;
•   workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the united states;
•   import and export licensing requirements, tariffs, and other trade and travel restrictions;
•   production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and
38
•   business interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism.
our revenues are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to the global nature of our operations. although we have foreign currency forward contracts to hedge forecasted product revenues denominated in foreign currencies, our efforts to reduce currency exchange losses may not be successful. as a result, currency fluctuations among our reporting currency, the u.s. dollar, and the currencies in which we do business will affect our operating results, often in unpredictable ways.
in addition, our international operations are subject to regulation under u.s. law. for example, the foreign corrupt practices act prohibits u.s. companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad. in many countries, the health care professionals we regularly interact with may meet the definition of a foreign government official for purposes of the foreign corrupt practices act. we also are subject to import/export control laws. failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences, including the possible delay in approval or refusal to approve a product, recalls, seizures, withdrawal of an approved product from the market, the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions, the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations and corresponding bad publicity and negative perception of our company in foreign countries.
our business has a substantial risk of product liability claims. if we do not obtain appropriate levels of insurance, product liability claims could adversely affect our business.
our business exposes us to significant potential product liability risks that are inherent in the development, clinical testing, manufacturing and sales and marketing of drugs and drug candidates. we have product liability insurance and clinical trial insurance in amounts that we believe are adequate to cover this risk. however, our insurance may not provide adequate coverage against all potential liabilities. if a claim is brought against us, we might be required to pay legal and other expenses to defend the claim, as well as pay uncovered damage awards resulting from a claim brought successfully against us and these damages could be significant and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. furthermore, whether or not we are ultimately successful in defending any such claims, we might be required to direct significant financial and managerial resources to such defense and adverse publicity is likely to result.
a breakdown or breach of our information technology systems could subject us to liability or interrupt the operation of our business.
we maintain and rely extensively on information technology systems and network infrastructures for the effective operation of our business. a disruption, infiltration or failure of our information technology systems or any of our data centers as a result of software or hardware malfunctions, computer viruses, cyber attacks, employee theft or misuse, power disruptions, natural disasters, floods or accidents could cause breaches of data security and loss of critical data, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business and subject us to both private and governmental causes of action. while we have implemented security measures in an attempt to minimize these risks to our data and information technology systems, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business.
if we fail to attract and retain skilled employees, our business could be materially harmed.
because our drug discovery and development activities are highly technical in nature, we require the services of highly qualified and trained scientists who have the skills necessary to conduct these activities. in addition, we need to attract and retain employees with experience in marketing and commercialization of medicines. we face intense competition for our personnel from our competitors and other companies throughout our industry. we also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. moreover, the growth of local biotechnology companies and the expansion of major pharmaceutical companies into the boston area have increased competition for the available pool of skilled employees, especially in technical fields, and the high cost of living in massachusetts makes it difficult to attract employees from other parts of the country to massachusetts. in addition, our october 2013 restructuring activities may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified employees. our ability to commercialize our products, and achieve our research and development objectives, depends on our ability to respond effectively to these demands. if we are unable to hire and retain qualified personnel, there could be a material adverse effect on our business.
39
the loss of the services of key employees or the failure to effectively integrate key employees could negatively affect our business.
our future success will depend in large part on our ability to retain the services of our key scientific and management personnel and to integrate new scientific and management personnel into our business. a loss of key personnel or a failure to properly integrate new personnel could be disruptive. we have entered into employment agreements with some executives and provide compensation-related benefits to all of our key employees that vest over time and therefore induce them to remain with us. however, the employment agreements can be terminated by the executive on relatively short notice. the value to employees of stock-related benefits that vest over time-such as options and restricted stock-is significantly affected by movements in our stock price, and may at any point in time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies. a failure to retain, as well as hire, train and effectively integrate into our organization a sufficient number of qualified scientists, professionals, sales personnel and senior management would negatively affect our business.
if we do not comply with laws regulating the protection of the environment and health and human safety, our business could be adversely affected.
our research and development efforts involve the regulated use of hazardous materials, chemicals and various controlled and radioactive compounds. although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by state, federal and foreign regulations, the risk of loss of, or accidental contamination or injury from, these materials cannot be eliminated. if an accident occurs, we could be held liable for resulting damages, which could be substantial. we also are subject to numerous environmental, health and workplace safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne pathogens and the handling of biohazardous materials. although we maintain workers' compensation insurance to cover us for costs we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of these materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. we maintain insurance to cover pollution conditions or other extraordinary or unanticipated events relating to our use and disposal of hazardous materials that we believe is appropriate based on the small amount of hazardous materials we generate. additional federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting our operations may be adopted in the future. we may incur substantial costs to comply with, and substantial fines or penalties if we violate, any of these laws or regulations.
if our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, our operations would be seriously harmed.
most of our operations, including our research and development activities, are conducted in a limited number of facilities. if any of our major facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, due to a fire, earthquake or similar event, our operations could be seriously harmed. for example, our corporate headquarters, as well as additional leased space that we use for certain logistical and laboratory operations and manufacturing, are located in a flood zone along the massachusetts coast. any such losses at our facilities could disrupt our operations and result in a significant disruption in our research, development, manufacturing and/or commercial activities, the loss or critical data and/or large expenses to repair or replace the facility, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.
risks related to holding our common stock and financing activities our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, and the terms of our credit agreement impose restrictions on our business, reducing our operational flexibility and creating default risks.
in july 2014, we entered into a credit agreement that provides for a $300.0 million senior secured term loan. we are required to repay principal on the loan in installments of $15.0 million per quarter from october 1, 2015 through july 1, 2016 and in installments of $60.0 million per quarter from october 1, 2016 through july 9, 2017.
our indebtedness could have important consequences to our business, including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse financial, business, economic and industry conditions, as well as other factors that are beyond our control. in october 2015, we will be required to begin repayment of the principal amount of our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of future cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes.
the credit agreement requires that we maintain, on a quarterly basis, a minimum level of kalydeco net revenues. further, the credit agreement includes negative covenants, subject to exceptions, restricting or limiting our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, engage in certain investment,
40
acquisition and disposition transactions, pay dividends, repurchase capital stock and enter into transactions with affiliates. as a result, we may be restricted from engaging in business activities that may otherwise improve our business. failure to comply with the covenants could result in an event of default that could trigger acceleration of our indebtedness, which would require us to repay all amounts owing under the credit agreement and/or our capital leases and could have a material adverse effect on our business.
additionally, our obligations under the credit agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries. all obligations under the credit agreement, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured, subject to certain exceptions, by substantially all of our assets and the assets of all guarantors, including the pledge of all or a portion of the equity interests of certain of our subsidiaries. if we fail to satisfy our obligations under the credit agreement or are unable to obtain sufficient funds to make payments, the lenders could foreclose on our pledged collateral.
our stock price may fluctuate.
market prices for securities of companies such as ours are highly volatile. from january 1, 2014 to december 31, 2014, our common stock traded between $59.79 and $124.35 per share. the market for our stock, like that of other companies in the biotechnology industry, has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. the future market price of our securities could be significantly and adversely affected by factors such as:
•   the information contained in our quarterly earnings releases, including our net product revenues and operating expenses for completed periods and guidance regarding future periods;
•   announcements of fda actions with respect to our drugs or our competitors' drugs, or regulatory filings for our drug candidates or those of our competitors, or announcements of interim or final results of clinical trials or nonclinical studies relating to our drugs, drug candidates or those of our competitors;
•   prescription data and other information disclosed by third parties regarding our business or products;
•   technological innovations or the introduction of new drugs by our competitors;
•   government regulatory action;
•   public concern as to the safety of drugs developed by us or our competitors;
•   developments in patent or other intellectual property rights or announcements relating to these matters;
•   developments in domestic and international governmental policy or regulation, for example, relating to intellectual property rights;
•   developments relating specifically to other companies and market conditions for pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks or stocks in general;
•   business development, capital structuring or financing activities; and
•   general worldwide or national economic, political and capital market conditions.
our quarterly operating results are subject to significant fluctuation.
our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past, and we expect that they will continue to do so in the future. factors that have caused quarterly fluctuations in the past include variable amounts of revenues, impairment charges, charges for excess and obsolete inventories, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments and the deconsolidation of alios. we cannot accurately predict our future revenues from our products, and our revenues from our products could vary on a quarterly basis. our revenues from our products may be affected by, among other factors, the timing of orders from our significant customers. our revenues also are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to the global nature of our operations. although we have foreign currency forward contracts to hedge forecasted product revenues denominated in foreign currencies, our efforts to reduce currency exchange losses may not be successful. as a result, currency fluctuations among our reporting currency, the u.s. dollar, and the currencies in which we do business may affect our operating results, often in unpredictable ways. our quarterly results also could be materially affected by significant charges, which may or may not be similar to charges we have experienced in the past. most of our operating expenses relate
41
to our research and development activities, do not vary directly with the amount of revenues and are difficult to adjust in the short term. as a result, if revenues in a particular quarter are below expectations, we are unlikely to reduce operating expenses proportionately for that quarter. these examples are only illustrative and other risks, including those discussed in these "risk factors," could also cause fluctuations in our reported financial results. our operating results during any one period do not necessarily suggest the results of future periods.
we expect that results from our clinical development activities and the clinical development activities of our competitors will continue to be released periodically, and may result in significant volatility in the price of our common stock.
any new information regarding our products and drug candidates or competitive products or potentially competitive drug candidates can substantially affect investors' perceptions regarding our future prospects. we, our collaborators and our competitors periodically provide updates regarding drug development programs, typically through press releases, conference calls and presentations at medical conferences. these periodic updates often include interim or final results from clinical trials conducted by us or our competitors and/or information about our or our competitors' expectations regarding regulatory filings and submissions as well as future clinical development of our products or drug candidates, competitive products or potentially competitive drug candidates. the timing of the release of information by us regarding our drug development programs is often beyond our control and is influenced by the timing of receipt of data from our clinical trials and by the general preference among pharmaceutical companies to disclose clinical data during medical conferences. in addition, the information disclosed about our clinical trials, or our competitors' clinical trials, may be based on interim rather than final data that may involve interpretation difficulties and may in any event not accurately predict final results.
we could be negatively affected by securities class action complaints.
on may 28, 2014, a purported shareholder class action local no. 8 ibew retirement plan & trust v. vertex pharmaceuticals incorporated, et al. was filed in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts, naming us and certain of our current and former officers and directors as defendants. the lawsuit alleged that we made material misrepresentations and/or omissions of material fact in our disclosures during the period from may 7, 2012 through may 29, 2012, all in violation of section 10(b) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, and rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. the purported class consists of all persons (excluding defendants) who purchased our common stock between may 7, 2012 and may 29, 2012. the plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages, costs and attorneys' fees as well as disgorgement of the proceeds from certain individual defendants' sales of our stock. on october 8, 2014, the court approved local no. 8 ibew retirement fund as lead plaintiff, and scott and scott llp as lead counsel for the plaintiff and the putative class. we filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on december 8, 2014 and the plaintiffs filed their opposition to our motion to dismiss on january 22, 2015. we believe that this action is without merit and intend to defend it vigorously. this action will take time and money to defend and may distract us from more productive activities. no assurance can be provided that we will be successful in defending this claim or that insurance proceeds will be sufficient to cover any liability under such claims.
we may need to raise additional capital that may not be available.
we expect to incur losses in 2015 and may in the future need to raise additional capital. we have borrowed $300.0 million under a credit agreement that we entered into in the third quarter of 2014. in recent periods, we also have received significant proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee benefit plans, but the amount and timing of future proceeds from employee benefits plans is uncertain. any potential public offering, private placement or debt financing may or may not be similar to the transactions that we entered into in the past. any debt financing may be on terms that, among other things, include conversion features that could result in dilution to our then-existing security holders and restrict our ability to pay interest and dividends-although we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. additionally, our pledge of our assets as collateral to secure our obligations under our credit agreement may limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing. any equity financings would result in dilution to our then-existing security holders. if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be required to curtail significantly or discontinue one or more of our research, drug discovery or development programs, including clinical trials, incur significant cash exit costs, or attempt to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies, drugs or drug candidates. based on many factors, including general economic conditions, additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.
42
issuances of additional shares of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline.
as of december 31, 2014, we had 241.8 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding. as of december 31, 2014, we also had outstanding options to purchase 12.0 million shares of common stock with a weighted-average exercise price of $56.81 per share. outstanding vested options are likely to be exercised if the market price of our common stock exceeds the applicable exercise price, and, in the future, we expect to issue additional options and restricted stock to directors and employees. in addition, we may issue additional common stock or restricted securities in the future as part of financing activities or business development activities and any such issuances may have a dilutive effect on our then-existing shareholders. sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the open market, or the availability of such shares for sale, could adversely affect the price of our common stock. the issuance of restricted common stock or common stock upon exercise of any outstanding options would be dilutive, and may cause the market price for a share of our common stock to decline.
we have adopted anti-takeover provisions and are subject to massachusetts corporate laws that may frustrate any attempt to remove or replace our current management or effectuate a business combination involving vertex.
our corporate charter and by-law provisions and massachusetts state laws may discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change of control of vertex that might be beneficial to us or our security holders. our charter provides for staggered terms for the members of the board of directors. our by-laws grant the directors a right to adjourn annual meetings of shareholders, and certain provisions of our by-laws may be amended only with an 80% shareholder vote. we may issue shares of any class or series of preferred stock in the future without shareholder approval and upon such terms as our board of directors may determine. the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any class or series of preferred stock that may be issued in the future. massachusetts state law prohibits us from engaging in specified business combinations, unless the combination is approved or consummated in a prescribed manner, and prohibits voting by any shareholder who acquires 20% or more of our voting stock without shareholder approval. as a result, shareholders or other parties may find it more difficult to remove or replace our current management.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are in the business of discovering, developing, manufacturing and commercializing small molecule drugs. we use precision medicine approaches to create transformative drugs for patients with serious diseases in specialty markets. our business is focused on developing and commercializing therapies for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, or cf, and advancing our research and early-stage development programs, while maintaining our financial strength.
we have marketed kalydeco (ivacaftor) since it was approved in 2012 for the treatment of patients six years of age and older with cf who have specific genetic mutations in their cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, or cftr, gene. in june 2014, we announced data from two phase 3 clinical trials, referred to as traffic and transport, of lumacaftor, a cftr corrector compound, in combination with ivacaftor, a cftr potentiator compound. in traffic and transport, we evaluated the combination regimen in patients with cf twelve years of age and older who have two copies (homozygous) of the f508del mutation in their cftr gene, which is the most prevalent form of cf. in november 2014, we submitted a new drug application, or nda, to the united states food and drug administration, or fda, and a marketing authorization application, or maa, to the european medicines agency, or ema, for lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor.
cystic fibrosis our plan is to (i) continue to increase the number of patients eligible for treatment with ivacaftor, (ii) obtain marketing approval for lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor for the treatment of patients with cf twelve years of age and older who have two copies of the f508del mutation in their cftr gene and (iii) research and develop earlier-stage compounds for the treatment of cf.
ivacaftor kalydeco (ivacaftor) was approved in 2012 in the united states and european union as a treatment for patients with cf six years of age and older who have the g551d mutation in their cftr gene. our kalydeco net product revenues have been increasing over the last several years due to the increased number of patients who are being treated with kalydeco in the united states and ex-u.s. markets as we have expanded the label for kalydeco and completed reimbursement discussions for a portion of the patients eligible for treatment with kalydeco in ex-u.s markets. we expect our kalydeco net product revenues to increase further in 2015 as a result of additional label expansions and an increase in the number of patients with cf for whom reimbursement is available in ex-u.s. markets.
lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in november 2014, we submitted an nda to the fda and an maa to the ema for lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in patients with cf twelve years of age and older who are homozygous for the f508del mutation in their cftr gene. in 2015, we submitted in canada, and expect to submit in australia, regulatory applications seeking approval for lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor. these regulatory applications were based on two phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor referred to as traffic and transport. all four treatment arms in traffic and transport met their primary endpoints of mean absolute improvement in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second, or ppfev1,  as compared to placebo.
the fda has granted us priority review of the nda and the european committee for medicinal products for human use has granted our request for accelerated assessment of the maa. the target date for the fda to complete its review of the nda for lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor under the prescription drug user fee act, or pdufa, is july 5, 2015. accordingly, we expect to begin recognizing net product revenues from lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in the united states in mid-2015. we do not expect significant net product revenues from lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor from ex-u.s. markets in 2015 due to the reimbursement discussions that will be required in these markets following the potential approval of the combination in the fourth quarter of 2015. we believe that there are approximately 22,000 patients with cf twelve years of age and older who are homozygous for the f508del mutation in north america, europe and australia, including approximately 8,500 in the united states and approximately 12,000 in europe.
49
vx-661 in combination with ivacaftor in 2015, we initiated a phase 3 development program for vx-661 in combination with ivacaftor in patients with cf twelve years of age and older, including patients who are homozygous for the f508del mutation in their cftr gene and patients who have one copy of the f508del mutation in their cftr gene (heterozygous).
next-generation cftr corrector compounds we also are seeking to identify and develop next-generation cftr corrector compounds that could be evaluated in future dual- and/or triple-combination treatment regimens with the potential to provide additional benefits to patients with cf. we have multiple next-generation correctors in the lead-optimization stage of research and expect to begin clinical development of a next-generation corrector in 2015.
research and early-stage development we are engaged in a number of other research and early-stage development programs, including programs in the areas of oncology and neurology. we plan to continue investing in our research programs and fostering scientific innovation in order to identify and develop transformative medicines with a focus on cf and other genetic diseases, oncology and neurology. we believe that pursuing research in diverse areas allows us to balance the risks inherent in drug development and may provide drug candidates that will form our pipeline in future years.
hcv infection in 2012 and 2013, we recognized significant net product revenues based on sales of incivek (telaprevir), a product for the treatment of genotype 1 hcv infection that we marketed in north america. in october 2013, in response to declining sales of incivek and increased competition, we reduced our focus on marketing incivek and eliminated the u.s. field-based sales force that had been promoting incivek. we have withdrawn incivek from the market in the united states, and we expect to wind-down any remaining activities relating to the field of hcv infection in 2015.
in addition, we incurred an intangible asset impairment charge of $412.9 million in the first quarter of 2013 related to vx-222 a drug candidate for the treatment of hcv infection. in the fourth quarter of 2014, we provided notice of termination of our collaboration with alios biopharma, inc., or alios, related to the development of hcv nucleotide analogues. our financial statements reflect the activities related to alios as discontinued operations.
drug discovery and development discovery and development of a new pharmaceutical product is a difficult and lengthy process that requires significant financial resources along with extensive technical and regulatory expertise and can take 10 to 15 years or more. potential drug candidates are subjected to rigorous evaluations, driven in part by stringent regulatory considerations, designed to generate information concerning efficacy, side-effects, proper dosage levels and a variety of other physical and chemical characteristics that are important in determining whether a drug candidate should be approved for marketing as a pharmaceutical product. most chemical compounds that are investigated as potential drug candidates never progress into development, and most drug candidates that do advance into development never receive marketing approval. because our investments in drug candidates are subject to considerable risks, we closely monitor the results of our discovery, research, clinical trials and nonclinical studies and frequently evaluate our drug development programs in light of new data and scientific, business and commercial insights, with the objective of balancing risk and potential. this process can result in abrupt changes in focus and priorities as new information becomes available and as we gain additional understanding of our ongoing programs and potential new programs, as well as those of our competitors.
if we believe that data from a completed registration program support approval of a drug candidate, we submit an nda to the fda requesting approval to market the drug candidate in the united states and seek analogous approvals from comparable regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions. to obtain approval, we must, among other things, demonstrate with evidence gathered in nonclinical studies and well-controlled clinical trials that the drug candidate is safe and effective for the disease it is intended to treat and that the manufacturing facilities, processes and controls for the manufacture of the drug candidate are adequate. the fda and foreign regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in deciding whether or not a drug candidate should be granted approval based on the benefits and risks of the drug candidate in the treatment of a particular disease, and could delay, limit or deny regulatory approval. if regulatory delays are significant or regulatory
50
approval is limited or denied altogether, our financial results and the commercial prospects for the drug candidate involved will be harmed.
regulatory compliance our marketing of pharmaceutical products is subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations. we have a corporate compliance program designed to actively identify, prevent and mitigate risk through the implementation of compliance policies and systems, and through the promotion of a culture of compliance. among other laws, regulations and standards, we are subject to various u.s. federal and state laws, and comparable foreign laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims statutes, and laws prohibiting the promotion of drugs for unapproved or off-label uses. anti-kickback laws make it illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration to induce the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. false claims laws prohibit anyone from presenting for payment to third-party payors, including medicare and medicaid, claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to maintain, administer and expand these compliance programs globally.
reimbursement sales of our products depend, to a large degree, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed health care organizations. we dedicate substantial management and other resources in order to obtain and maintain appropriate levels of reimbursement for our products from third-party payors, including governmental organizations in the united states and ex-u.s. markets. if lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor is approved, in the united states we will engage in discussions with numerous commercial insurers and managed health care organizations, along with government health programs that are typically managed by authorities in the individual states. in europe and many other foreign countries, we will need to focus on obtaining and maintaining government reimbursement for lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor on a country-by-country basis, because in many foreign countries patients are unable to access prescription pharmaceutical products that are not reimbursed by their governments. consistent with our experience with kalydeco when it was first approved, we expect reimbursement discussions in ex-u.s. markets may take a significant period of time following obtaining marketing approval for the combination therapy.

net loss attributable to vertex net loss attributable to vertex has been affected by increasing kalydeco net product revenues, rapidly declining incivek net product revenues and royalty revenues, significant intangible asset impairment charges, inventory write-offs, restructuring charges and income (loss) from discontinued operations during the three year period ended december 31, 2014.
comparison of net loss attributable to vertex 2014 vs. 2013
net loss attributable to vertex was $738.6 million in 2014 compared to net loss attributable to vertex of $445.0 million in 2013. our revenues decreased in 2014 as compared to 2013 due to a $442.3 million decrease in incivek revenues, a $166.1 million decrease in collaborative revenues and a $115.7 million decrease in royalty revenues, partially offset by a $92.5 million increase in kalydeco revenues. our operating costs and expenses decreased in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to an intangible asset impairment charge related to vx-222 of $412.9 million recorded in 2013 and decreases in cost of product revenues, royalty expenses, research and development expenses and sales, general and administrative expenses. in 2014, the $45.2 million loss reflected in other items, net was primarily due to interest expense associated with the leases for our corporate headquarters. in 2013 the $106.4 million gain reflected in other items, net was primarily due to a benefit from income taxes we recorded related to the vx-222 impairment charge. the income (loss) from discontinued operations in 2014 and 2013 related to a collaboration with alios that was terminated in 2014. in 2015, we expect that our net income (loss) will be largely dependent on the timing of potential regulatory approval of lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in the united states and on our success in commercializing this combination therapy following the potential approval.
comparison of net loss attributable to vertex 2013 vs. 2012
net loss attributable to vertex was $445.0 million in 2013 compared to net loss attributable to vertex of $107.0 million in 2012. our revenues decreased in 2013 as compared to 2012 due to a $695.5 million decrease in incivek net product revenues partially offset by a $199.6 million increase in kalydeco net product revenues and a $165.7 million increase in collaborative revenues. our operating costs and expenses increased in 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily due to an intangible asset impairment charge related to vx-222 of $412.9 million recorded in 2013 and an increase research and development expenses, partially offset by a decrease in sales, general and administrative expenses and an aggregate of $133.2 million in cost of product revenues related to charges for excess and obsolete incivek inventories that we incurred in 2012. the income (loss) from discontinued operations in 2013 and 2012 related to a collaboration with alios that was terminated in 2014.
earnings per share in 2014, 2013 and 2012, net loss attributable to vertex was $3.14, $1.98 and $0.50, respectively, per diluted share. in 2014 and 2013, net loss from continuing operations attributable to vertex was $3.14 and $2.24, respectively, per diluted share. in 2012, net income from continuing operations attributable to vertex was $0.15 per diluted share.
52
common shares outstanding our shares of outstanding common stock increased by 8.0 million shares from 233.8 million shares on december 31, 2013 to 241.8 million shares on december 31, 2014 due to our issuance in 2014 of approximately 8.0 million shares of common stock pursuant to our employee equity programs. our shares of outstanding common stock increased by 16.5 million shares from 217.3 million shares on december 31, 2012 to 233.8 million shares on december 31, 2013 due to our issuance in 2013 of approximately 8.3 million shares of common stock upon conversion of our convertible senior subordinated notes and 8.2 million shares of common stock issued pursuant to our employee equity programs.
stock-based compensation stock-based compensation expense was $177.5 million, $126.8 million and $113.8 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. our stock-based compensation expense has been increasing due to the increase in our stock price and the associated increase in the grant-date fair value of equity awards.

our total net product revenues have been decreasing on an annual basis due to significant decreases in incivek (telaprevir) net product revenues partially offset by increases in kalydeco (ivacaftor) net product revenues. in 2015, we expect net product revenues to increase due to (i) expected increases in kalydeco net product revenues and (ii) potential net product revenues in the second half of 2015 in the united states from sales of lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor.
we began marketing kalydeco in the united states and certain international markets in 2012. in 2014, the fda approved multiple label expansions for kalydeco, and in july 2014 we obtained the first label expansion for kalydeco in the european union. in 2014, kalydeco net product revenues were $463.8 million, including $201.4 million of net product revenues from ex-u.s. markets, compared to kalydeco net product revenues of $371.3 million, including $154.7 million of net product revenues from ex-u.s. markets in 2013. the increase in kalydeco net product revenues in 2014, compared to 2013, was primarily due to additional patients being treated with kalydeco as we completed reimbursement discussions in various jurisdictions and increased the number of patients eligible to receive kalydeco through label expansions. in 2015, we expect further increases in kalydeco net product revenues as we continue to increase the number of patients that are treated with kalydeco.
incivek net product revenues were $24.1 million in 2014, a significant decrease from $466.4 million in 2013. we have withdrawn incivek from the market in the united states, and we do not expect significant incivek net product revenues in future periods.
we believe our total net product revenues for 2015 will be dependent on the timing of potential regulatory approval of lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in the united states and on our success in commercializing this combination therapy following the potential approval. we submitted an nda to the fda and an maa to the ema for lumacaftor in
53
combination with ivacaftor in november 2014. the target date for the fda to complete its review of the nda under pdufa is july 5, 2015. accordingly, we expect to begin recognizing net product revenues from lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in the united states in mid-2015. we do not expect significant net product revenues from lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in 2015 from ex-u.s. markets due to the reimbursement discussions that will be required in these markets following the potential approval of the combination in the fourth quarter of 2015.
royalty revenues our royalty revenues were $40.9 million, $156.6 million and $141.5 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. since the beginning of 2014, our royalty revenues have consisted of (i) revenues related to a cash payment we received in 2008 when we sold our rights to certain hiv royalties and (ii) revenues related to certain third-party royalties payable by our collaborators on sales of hiv drugs and telaprevir that also result in corresponding royalty expenses. in 2012 and 2013, we received significant royalties from janssen nv based on incivo (telaprevir) net product sales. our rights to receive royalties on incivo sales ended at the beginning of 2014, and janssen nv currently has a fully-paid license to market incivo in its territories, subject to the continued payment of certain third-party royalties.
collaborative revenues our collaborative revenues have fluctuated significantly on an annual basis. this variability has been due to, among other things: the recognition of payments from janssen inc. related to our outlicense of vx-787 in 2014; the 2013 amendment of our collaboration agreement with janssen nv that resulted in significant collaborative revenues in 2013; and revenues we received from services we provided to janssen nv and mitsubishi tanabe through our third-party manufacturing network in 2012.
the table presented below is a summary of our collaborative revenues for 2014, 2013 and 2012:

in 2014, the majority of our collaborative revenues related to $35.0 million in payments we received from janssen inc. related to our outlicense of vx-787.
in 2013, we recognized $203.4 million in janssen nv collaborative revenues, which were primarily attributable to the $152.0 million payment we received pursuant to our amendment to the janssen nv collaboration agreement. these collaborative revenues also included the acceleration of the remaining deferred revenues related to the up-front payment we received from janssen nv in 2006. in 2014, our collaborative revenues from janssen nv decreased to $7.1 million, and we do not expect significant collaborative revenues from janssen nv in future periods.
collaborative revenues from cfft decreased from $14.3 million in 2013 to $6.5 million in 2014 due to the completion of the reimbursable research activities pursuant to our collaboration with cfft in february 2014. collaborative revenues from cfft decreased slightly in 2012 as compared to 2013. we do not expect significant collaborative revenues from cfft in future periods.
54
in 2012, we recognized $9.6 million in collaborative revenues related to a one-time payment that we received from mitsubishi tanabe in 2009 and recognized over a period of time, and also recognized revenues related to manufacturing services we provided to mitsubishi tanabe through our third-party manufacturing network. we have not recognized any collaborative revenues from mitsubishi tanabe since the first half of 2012 and will not recognize any future collaborative revenues pursuant to our collaboration agreement with mitsubishi tanabe.

cost of product revenues our cost of product revenues includes the cost of producing inventories that corresponded to product revenues for the reporting period, plus the third-party royalties payable on our net sales of kalydeco and incivek. in 2014, cost of product revenues consisted primarily of third-party royalties for kalydeco. pursuant to our agreement with cfft, our tiered third-party royalties on kalydeco, and lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor, if approved, calculated as a percentage of net sales, range from the single digits to the sub-teens. in 2015, we expect our cost of product revenues to increase as compared to 2014 due to increased net product revenues, together with an increase in the third-party royalty rate payable to cfft as we begin to pay royalties at the top end of the royalty range.
cost of product revenues in 2013 and 2012 included an aggregate of $10.4 million and $133.2 million, respectively, in write-offs for excess and obsolete inventories.
our cost of product revenues decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 as a result of decreased product revenues and the charges incurred in 2013 for excess and obsolete incivek inventories and a $9.3 million commercial milestone payment to cfft that was reflected in cost of product revenues in 2013. our cost of product revenues decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 due to decreased product revenues and the charges incurred for excess and obsolete incivek inventories that we incurred in 2012.
royalty expenses royalty expenses include third-party royalties payable upon net sales of telaprevir by our collaborators and royalty expenses related to a subroyalty payable to a third party on net sales of an hiv protease inhibitor sold by glaxosmithkline. royalty expenses in 2014 decreased by $20.0 million, or 49%, as compared to 2013 as a result of decreased incivo sales by janssen nv. royalty expenses in 2013 decreased slightly compared to 2012. our royalty expenses in future periods will be dependent on our collaborators' net sales of telaprevir in their territories. our royalty expenses with respect to telaprevir and the hiv protease inhibitor are offset by corresponding royalty revenues.

our research and development expenses include internal and external costs incurred for research and development of our drugs and drug candidates. we do not assign our internal costs, such as salary and benefits, stock-based compensation expense, laboratory supplies and other direct expenses and infrastructure costs, to individual drugs or drug candidates, because the employees within our research and development groups typically are deployed across multiple research and development programs. these internal costs are significantly greater than our external costs, such as the costs of services provided to us by clinical research organizations and other outsourced research, which we allocate by individual program. all research and development costs for our drugs and drug candidates are expensed as incurred.
over the past three years, we have incurred $2.5 billion in research and development expenses associated with drug discovery and development. the successful development of our drug candidates is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risks. in addition, the duration of clinical trials may vary substantially according to the type, complexity and novelty of the drug candidate and the disease indication being targeted. the fda and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial requirements on the introduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products, typically requiring lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures, sampling activities and other costly and time-consuming procedures. data obtained from nonclinical and clinical activities at any step in the testing process may be adverse and lead to discontinuation or redirection of development activities. data obtained from these activities also are susceptible of varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. the duration and cost of discovery, nonclinical studies and clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project and are difficult to predict. therefore, accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate costs to bring our drug candidates to market are not available.
in 2013 and 2014, costs related to our cf programs represented the largest portion of our development costs. in 2012, our hcv programs represented the largest portion of our development costs. additionally, any estimates regarding development and regulatory timelines for our drug candidates are highly subjective and subject to change. in november 2014, we submitted an nda to the fda and an maa to the ema for lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor. the target date for the fda to complete its review of the nda under pdufa is july 5, 2015. accordingly, if we obtain approval on a timely basis, we expect to begin recognizing net product revenues from lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in the united states in mid-2015. we do not expect significant net product revenues from lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in 2015 from ex-u.s. markets due to the reimbursement discussions that will be required in these markets following the potential approval of the combination in the fourth quarter of 2015. we cannot make a meaningful estimate when, if ever, our other clinical development programs will generate revenues and cash flows.

our development expenses decreased by $50.4 million, or 8%, in 2014 as compared to 2013 and increased by $96.1 million, or 17%, in 2013 as compared to 2012. the decrease in 2014 compared to 2013 was principally due to decreased outsourced services expenses and drug supply costs, partially offset by increased stock-based compensation expense. the significant decrease in outsourced services expenses in 2014 was largely attributable to decreased clinical trial expenses resulting from the completion of the traffic and transport clinical trials in the first half of 2014. we expect our development expenses for outsourced activities to increase in 2015 as compared to 2014 due to activities related to clinical trials, including the phase 3 clinical development program for vx-661 in combination with ivacaftor.
the increased development expenses in 2013 in comparison to 2012 were principally due to the expansion of clinical development programs in cf, including the conduct of the phase 3 program for the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor, and increased drug supply costs primarily related to lumacaftor.

sales, general and administrative expenses decreased by 14% in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to decreased headcount following our october 2013 restructuring activities. sales, general and administrative expenses decreased by 18% in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to decreased incivek commercial expenses and our october 2013 restructuring activities, partially offset by increased kalydeco commercial expenses.
restructuring expense in 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recorded restructuring expenses of $50.9 million, $40.5 million and $1.8 million, respectively. our restructuring expenses in 2014 primarily related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters in massachusetts to boston from cambridge. our restructuring expenses in 2013 primarily related to our october 2013 reduction in headcount. as of december 31, 2014, our accrued restructuring liability related to our lease obligations in cambridge was $45.0 million. these lease obligations primarily expire on december 31, 2015 and april 30, 2018.
intangible asset impairment charges in 2013, we recorded a $412.9 million impairment charge related to vx-222, a non-nucleoside hcv polymerase inhibitor. in connection with this impairment charge, we recorded a credit of $127.6 million in our provision for income taxes, resulting in a net effect on net loss attributable to vertex related to this impairment charge of $285.3 million in 2013. there were no corresponding intangible asset impairment charges recorded related to continuing operations in 2014 or 2012.
in 2013, we recorded a $250.6 million impairment charge related to the alios hcv nucleotide analogue program and a benefit for income taxes of $102.1 million that is included in loss from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interest for 2013.
other items, net interest expense, net in 2014, 2013 and 2012, interest expense, net was $72.9 million, $22.9 million and $15.0 million, respectively. the increase in interest expense in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to interest expense of $60.2 million associated with the leases for our corporate headquarters and interest expense of $10.4 million related to the $300.0 million we borrowed in july 2014 pursuant to our credit agreement. the increase in interest expense, net in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to interest expense associated with the leases for our corporate headquarters commencing in the fourth quarter of 2013.
other income (expense), net in 2014, net other income was $30.4 million primarily due to a credit of $36.7 million related to a one-time cash payment we received in 2014 from our landlord pursuant to leases for our corporate headquarters. in 2013, we recorded net other income of $6.9 million primarily related to foreign exchange gains. in 2012, our net other income was not significant.
income taxes in 2014, we recorded a provision for income taxes of $7.0 million. in 2013, we recorded a benefit from income taxes of $122.4 million. this benefit from income taxes was primarily due to a benefit of $127.6 million related to our impairment charge for the vx-222 intangible asset. in 2012, our benefit from income taxes was not significant.
58
discontinued operations as of september 30, 2014, we concluded that we no longer had significant continuing involvement with alios, a variable interest entity that we consolidated from june 2011 through december 2013.  as a result, the effect of the alios collaboration is presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations.
in 2014, we recorded a loss from discontinued operations attributable to vertex of $0.9 million.  in 2013, we recorded income from discontinued operations of $58.6 million and in 2012 we recorded a loss from discontinued operations of $139.3 million.  our income (losses) from discontinued operations in these periods related to gains and losses due to the deconsolidation of alios, an intangible asset impairment charge, a benefit from income taxes related to this charge and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration we estimated alios would receive under the collaboration agreement. for additional information regarding the alios collaboration please refer to "critical accounting policies and estimates - collaborations; variable interest entities."
liquidity and capital resources as of december 31, 2014, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $1.39 billion, which represented a decrease of $78.0 million from approximately $1.47 billion as of december 31, 2013. this decrease was due to cash expenditures we made during 2014 related to, among other things, research and development expenses and sales, general and administrative expenses and $132.9 million for capital expenditures, largely offset by cash receipts from product sales, $300.0 million we borrowed pursuant to a credit agreement we entered into in the third quarter of 2014, $274.6 million in cash we received from issuances of common stock pursuant to employee benefit plans, the payments of $35.0 million that we received from janssen inc. and a one-time cash payment of $36.7 million from our landlord pursuant to the terms of the leases for our corporate headquarters. we expect to continue to incur losses on a quarterly basis until we can substantially increase revenues as a result of potential future regulatory approvals, the timing of which are uncertain.
sources of liquidity we intend to rely on our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities together with cash flows from product sales as our primary source of liquidity. our cash flows from product sales have decreased on an annual basis during each of the past two years. in the near-term, we expect cash flows from sales of kalydeco to increase as we continue to increase the number of patients that are treated with kalydeco. if we obtain approval on a timely basis, we expect to begin recognizing net product revenues from lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in the united states in mid-2015. we do not expect significant net product revenues from lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in 2015 from ex-u.s. markets due to the reimbursement discussions that will be required in these markets following the potential approval of the combination in the fourth quarter of 2015.
we have borrowed $300.0 million under a credit agreement that we entered into in the third quarter of 2014 and, subject to certain conditions, we may request up to an additional $200.0 million pursuant to that credit agreement. in recent periods, we also have received significant proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee benefit plans, but the amount and timing of future proceeds from employee benefits plans is uncertain. other possible sources of liquidity include strategic collaborative agreements that include research and/or development funding, commercial debt, public and private offerings of our equity and debt securities, development milestones and royalties on sales of products, software and equipment leases, strategic sales of assets or businesses and financial transactions. negative covenants in our credit agreement may prohibit or limit our ability to access these sources of liquidity.
future capital requirements we incur substantial operating expenses to conduct research and development activities and operate our organization. in addition, we must repay the principal amount on the $300.0 million we borrowed in the third quarter of 2014 as follows: $15.0 million in the second half of 2015, $105.0 million in 2016 and $180.0 million in 2017. we also have substantial facility and capital lease obligations, including leases for two buildings in boston, massachusetts that continue through 2028. we expect that cash flows from kalydeco together with our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. the adequacy of our available funds to meet our future operating and capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the amounts of future revenues generated by kalydeco, potential revenues from lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor, and the potential introduction or one or
59
more of our other drug candidates to the market, and the number, breadth, cost and prospects of our research and development programs.
financing strategy in the third quarter of 2014, we borrowed $300.0 million pursuant to a credit agreement. in addition, subject to certain conditions, we may request that the lenders loan us up to an additional $200.0 million under the credit agreement. although we do not have any plans to do so in the near term, we may raise additional capital through public offerings or private placements of our securities. in addition, we may raise additional capital through securing new collaborative agreements or other methods of financing. we will continue to manage our capital structure and to consider all financing opportunities, whenever they may occur, that could strengthen our long-term liquidity profile. negative covenants in our credit agreement may prohibit or limit our ability to obtain future financing and there can be no assurance that any such financing opportunities will be available on acceptable terms, if at all.

leases we lease two buildings that are located at fan pier in boston, massachusetts. we commenced lease payments on these two buildings in december 2013 and the initial lease periods end in december 2028.
our future minimum commitments under our kendall square lease are included in "facility operating leases, excluding fan pier leases." we have entered into three subleases for a portion of the rentable square footage at the kendall square facility to offset our on-going contractual lease obligations. the future minimum committed income from the subleases is $11.4 million for 2015, $30.7 million for 2016 and 2017 and $5.1 million for 2018, including amounts related to a sublease executed in february 2015. these amounts are not offset against our obligations set forth in the table above.
the table also reflects leases of equipment, leasehold improvements and software licenses that are accounted for as capital leases.
senior secured term loan in july 2014, we entered into a credit agreement with the lenders party thereto, and macquarie us trading llc, or macquarie, as administrative agent. the credit agreement provides for a $300.0 million senior secured term loan. the interest rate under the term loan is subject to adjustment and the table above assumes a mid-2015 approval of lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor. the company includes estimates for interest in "senior secured term loan", which are equivalent to management's expectations for the probable outcome of variable interest rates that are dependent on various future events and market interest rates.
research, development and drug supply costs
"research, development and drug supply costs," does not include certain payments we are obligated to make to clinical research organizations, or cros because these contracts are cancelable, at our option, with notice. however, we historically have not cancelled such contracts. as of december 31, 2014, we had accrued $22.4 million related to these contracts for
60
costs incurred for services provided through december 31, 2014, and we have approximately $96.9 million in cancelable future commitments based on existing contracts as of december 31, 2014. these amounts reflect planned expenditures based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to, or terminations of, existing contracts or anticipated or potential new contracts.
collaborative arrangements we have entered into certain research and development collaboration agreements with third parties that include the funding of certain development, manufacturing and commercialization efforts with the potential for future milestone and royalty payments by us upon the achievement of pre-established developmental, regulatory and/or commercial targets. our obligation to fund these efforts is contingent upon continued involvement in the programs and/or the lack of any adverse events that could cause the discontinuance of the programs. pursuant to our collaboration with bioaxone, bioaxone has the potential to receive up to $90.0 million including a license continuation fee and development and regulatory milestone payments; and commercial milestone payments as well as royalties on future product sales, if any. we also have royalty and milestone obligations to the cfft. contingent payments under these agreements become due and payable only upon achievement of certain milestones and are not included in the contractual obligations table above.
tax-related obligations we exclude liabilities pertaining to uncertain tax positions from our summary of contractual obligations as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. as of december 31, 2014, we have $0.9 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions. as of december 31, 2014, we cannot reasonably estimate the amount we expect to pay within the next twelve months in connection with such settlements.
other funding commitments our table detailing contractual commitments and obligations does not include severance payment obligations to certain of our executive officers in the event of a not-for-cause employment termination under existing employment contracts. we provide information regarding these obligations annually in our proxy statement for our annual meeting of shareholders.
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. these items are monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which the change occurs. we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate.
we believe that our application of the following accounting policies, each of which requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management, are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results:
•   revenue recognition;
•   intangible assets;
•   collaborations and variable interest entities;
•   research and development accruals;
•   commercial supplies and inventories;
•   income taxes;
•   leases; and
•   restructuring expenses.
61
our accounting policies, including the ones discussed below, are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, including note a, "nature of business and accounting policies," included in this annual report on form 10-k.
revenue recognition product revenues, net we generate product revenues from sales in the united states and in international markets. we sell our products principally to a limited number of specialty pharmacy providers and selected regional wholesalers in north america as well as government-owned and supported customers in international markets, collectively, our customers. our customers in north america subsequently resell our products to patients and health care providers. separately, we have arrangements with numerous third-party payors in north america that provide for government-mandated and privately-negotiated rebates, chargebacks and discounts. we recognize net product revenues from sales of our products upon delivery to our customers as long as:
•   there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists between us and our customer;
•   collectability is reasonably assured; and
•   the price is fixed or determinable.
in order to conclude that the price is fixed or determinable, we must be able to calculate our gross product revenues from our customers and reasonably estimate our net product revenues. our gross product revenues are based on the fixed price for our products that we charge our customers. we estimate our net product revenues by deducting from our gross product revenues (i) trade allowances, such as invoice discounts for prompt payment and customer fees, (ii) estimated government and private payor rebates, chargebacks and discounts, (iii) estimated reserves for expected product returns and (iv) estimated costs of incentives offered to certain indirect customers, including patients. we make significant estimates and judgments that materially affect our recognition of net product revenues. changes in our estimates of net product revenues could have a material effect on net product revenues recorded in the period in which we determine that change occurs.
in certain instances, we may be unable to reasonably conclude that the price is fixed or determinable at the time of delivery, in which case we defer the recognition of revenues. once we are able to determine that the price is fixed or determinable, we recognize the revenues associated with the units in which revenue recognition was deferred.
the value of the rebates, chargebacks and discounts provided to third-party payors per course of treatment vary significantly and are based on government-mandated discounts and our arrangements with other third-party payors. typically, government-mandated discounts in the united states and canada are significantly larger than discounts provided to other third-party payors in those countries. in order to estimate our total rebates, chargebacks and discounts, we estimate the percentage of prescriptions that will be covered by each third-party payor, which is referred to as the payor mix. we track available information regarding changes, if any, to the payor mix for our products, to our contractual terms with third-party payors and to applicable governmental programs and regulations and levels of our products in the distribution channel. we adjust our estimated rebates, chargebacks and discounts based on new information, including information regarding actual rebates, chargebacks and discounts for our products, as it becomes available. claims by third-party payors for rebates, chargebacks and discounts frequently are submitted to us significantly after the related sales, potentially resulting in adjustments in the period in which the new information becomes known.
we have withdrawn incivek from the market in the united states. as of december 31, 2014, we maintained a reserve of approximately $16.2 million for government rebates for incivek. there typically is no deadline by which government payors must submit claims, and as a result we expect to monitor this reserve at least through 2016. if an adjustment to this reserve is required, we expect it would be reflected as either an increase or decrease to net product revenues in the period in which the adjustment is made.
our customers generally have the right to return unopened unprescribed packages subject to contractual limitations. to date returns have been minimal and, based on inventory levels held by our customers and our distribution model, we believe that returns of products will continue to be minimal. we track actual returns by individual production lots and will continue to monitor inventory levels in the distribution channel. if necessary, we will adjust our estimated product returns based on new information as it becomes available.
62
collaborative revenues we recognize revenues generated through collaborative research, development and/or commercialization agreements. the terms of these agreements typically include payment to us of one or more of the following: nonrefundable, up-front license fees; development and commercial milestone payments; funding of research and/or development activities; payments for services we provide through our third-party manufacturing network; and royalties on net sales of licensed products. each of these types of payments results in collaborative revenues, except for revenues from royalties on net sales of licensed products, which are classified as royalty revenues.
for each collaborative research, development and/or commercialization agreement that results in revenues, we determine (i) whether multiple deliverables exist, (ii) whether the undelivered elements have value to the customer on a stand-alone basis, (iii) how the deliverables should be separated and (iv) how the consideration should be allocated to the deliverables. for arrangements entered into or materially modified after january 1, 2011, we allocate consideration in an arrangement using the relative selling price method based on our best estimate of selling price of deliverables if we do not have vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence. as part of the accounting for these agreements, we must develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the best estimate of selling price. we utilize key assumptions to determine the best estimate of selling price, which may include patient enrollment requirements from regulatory authorities, development timelines, reimbursement rates for personnel costs, discount rates, and estimated third-party development costs.
in the fourth quarter of 2013, we amended our collaboration agreement with janssen nv, and were required to make significant estimates regarding (i) the determination of whether or not the agreement was materially modified and (ii) the estimated selling price for the remaining telaprevir development activities. we recognized $182.4 million of collaborative revenues pursuant to the collaboration agreement in the fourth quarter of 2013. this amount was primarily attributable to (i) the new consideration received from janssen nv, including the $152.0 million fourth quarter 2013 payment and the remaining deferred revenues related to the 2006 up-front payment less (ii) our best estimate of selling price for the remaining telaprevir development activities. as of december 31, 2014, the remaining deferred revenue balance related to janssen nv was not material.
intangible assets we maintain an indefinite-lived in-process research and development asset on our consolidated balance sheet until either the research and development project underlying it is completed or the asset becomes impaired. when we determine that an asset has become impaired or we abandon a project, we write down the carrying value of the related intangible asset to its fair value and take an impairment charge in the period in which the impairment occurs.
we assess the fair value of assets, including intangible assets such as in-process research and development assets, using a variety of methods, including present-value models that are based upon multiple probability-weighted scenarios involving the development and potential commercialization of the acquired drug candidates. the present-value models require us to make significant assumptions regarding the estimates that market participants would make in evaluating a drug candidate, including the probability of successfully completing clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approval to market the drug candidate, the timing of and the expected costs to complete in-process research and development projects, future net cash flows from potential drug sales, which are based on estimates of the sales price of the drug, the number of patients who will be diagnosed and treated and our competitive position in the marketplace, and appropriate discount and tax rates.
we test our intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis as of october 1, and more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstance suggest that impairment may exist. events that could result in an impairment, or trigger an interim impairment assessment, include the receipt of additional clinical or nonclinical data regarding our drug candidate or a potentially competitive drug candidate, changes in the clinical development program for a drug candidate or new information regarding potential sales for the drug. in connection with each annual impairment assessment and any interim impairment assessment, we compare the fair value of the asset as of the date of the assessment with the carrying value of the asset on our consolidated balance sheet.
in 2013, we incurred intangible asset impairment charges of $412.9 million and $250.6 million related to continuing operations and discontinued operations, respectively, that related to drug candidates for the treatment of hcv infection. as of december 31, 2014, we had $29.0 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet related to a vie.

collaborations; variable interest entities our collaborations require us to apply accounting policies that involve significant judgments and that have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. under applicable accounting guidance, as a result of the relationships established through collaboration agreements, our collaborators may be deemed to be variable interest entities, or vies, our licenses may result in a variable interest in collaborators as a whole and our being the primary beneficiary of vies. as a result, we are required to consolidate vies financial statements into our financial statements for the period during which we have a variable interest in the vie and are the vie's primary beneficiary, and if we later determine that we no longer have a variable interest or are no longer the primary beneficiary we are required to deconsolidate the vie. in addition, if we determine that we no longer have significant continuing involvement with a vie, its operations and direct expenses incurred by us are reflected in our discontinued operations presentation.
we believe that the following effects of the consolidation and deconsolidation of vies on our consolidated financial statements are the most significant:
•   beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014, we are consolidating all of bioaxone's expenses and revenues into our consolidated statements of operations, eliminating all intercompany balances and transactions. as of december 31, 2014, our consolidated balance sheet includes bioaxone's balances.
•   as of september 30, 2014, we concluded that we no longer had significant continuing involvement with alios due to our intent and ability to terminate the alios agreement, which we terminated during the fourth quarter of 2014; therefore, the operations of alios, including collaboration expenses reimbursed by vertex are presented as discontinued operations for the periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
•   in 2013, the deconsolidation of alios resulted in a gain of $68.2 million attributable to vertex. the $68.2 million gain was approximately equal to the difference between (i) losses we recorded in 2011 and 2012 based on increases in the fair value of contingent milestone payments and royalties payable by us to alios and (ii) the aggregate of $120.0 million in up-front and milestone payments that we made to alios pursuant to the alios collaboration.
•   in each period, we recorded net loss (income) attributable to the alios noncontrolling interest. this net loss (income) reflected alios' net loss (income) for the period as adjusted for gains and losses in the fair value of the contingent milestone payments and royalties payable by us to alios. determining the fair value of the contingent milestone payments and royalties payable by us to alios required us to make significant estimates regarding the probability and potential timing of achieving each of the milestones pursuant to the agreement, future potential net sales of the hcv nucleotide analogues licensed from alios and appropriate discount and tax rates. these net losses (income) attributable to the alios noncontrolling interest are included in loss from discontinued operations for 2012 and 2013.
research and development accruals research and development expenses, including amounts funded through research and development collaborations, are expensed as incurred. when third-party service providers' billing terms do not coincide with our period-end, we are required to make estimates of our obligations to those third parties, including clinical trial and pharmaceutical development costs, contractual services costs, costs for drug supply, marketing expenses and infrastructure expenses incurred in a given accounting period and record accruals at the end of the period. we base our estimates on our knowledge of the research and development programs, services performed for the period, experience with related activities and the expected duration of the third-party service contract, where applicable.
commercial supplies and inventories we began capitalizing the costs of our kalydeco inventories on january 1, 2012 and the costs of our lumacaftor inventories on july 1, 2014. we capitalize inventories produced in preparation for initiating sales of a drug candidate when the related drug candidate is considered to have a high likelihood of regulatory approval and the related costs are expected to be recoverable through sale of the inventories. in determining whether or not to capitalize such inventories, we evaluate, among other factors, information regarding the drug candidate's safety and efficacy, the status of regulatory submissions and communications with regulatory authorities and the outlook for commercial sales, including the existence of current or anticipated competitive drugs and the availability of reimbursement. in addition, we evaluate risks associated with manufacturing the drug candidate and the remaining shelf life of the inventories. after we begin capitalizing inventories, we
64
perform an assessment of the recoverability of capitalized inventory during each reporting period, and write down any excess and obsolete inventories to their net realizable value in the period in which the impairment is first identified.
in 2013 and 2012, following periodic assessments of the recoverability of our inventories, we recorded within cost of product revenues an aggregate of $10.4 million and $133.2 million, respectively in charges primarily related to excess and obsolete incivek inventories based on our analysis of our inventory levels in relation to our commercial outlook for incivek. as of december 31, 2014, all of our inventories are related to kalydeco and lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor. periodic assessments of the recoverability of capitalized costs involve significant estimates and judgments on the part of management.
income taxes we maintain a valuation allowance on our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets because we have an extended history of annual losses. our u.s. federal net operating loss carryforwards totaled approximately $3.6 billion as of december 31, 2014. on an annual basis, we reassess the valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets. after consideration of all the evidence, both positive and negative, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset as of december 31, 2014 because it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. in future periods, if we determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized, (i) the valuation allowance would be decreased, (ii) a portion or all of the deferred tax asset would be reflected on our consolidated balance sheet and (iii) we would record non-cash benefits in our consolidated statements of operations related to the reflection of the deferred tax asset on our consolidated balance sheet.
leases in 2011, we entered into two leases for our corporate headquarters. our corporate headquarters were built during the period from 2011 through december 2013. we lease our corporate headquarters pursuant to leases that expire in 2028, subject to our right to extend the leases for an additional 10 years. because we were involved in the construction project, we were deemed for accounting purposes to be the owner of the buildings during the construction period. accordingly, we recorded project construction costs incurred by the landlord as an asset and a related financing obligation in "property and equipment, net" and "construction financing lease obligation," respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets.
upon completion of the construction of the buildings, we evaluated the leases and determined that the leases did not meet the criteria for "sale-leaseback" treatment. accordingly, we depreciate the asset and incur interest expense related to the financing obligation recorded on our balance sheet. we bifurcate our lease payments pursuant to the leases into (i) a portion that is allocated to the buildings and (ii) a portion that is allocated to the land on which the buildings were constructed. the portion of the lease obligations allocated to the land is treated as an operating lease. in connection with the leases for our corporate headquarters, in 2015, we expect to incur approximately $60 million in interest expense, $13 million in depreciation expense and $7 million in operating expenses.
restructuring expenses we have adopted several plans to restructure our facility operations for which we have incurred restructuring expenses in the three years ended december 31, 2014. in particular, in 2014, we recorded $50.9 million in costs associated with exit and disposal activities related to the relocation of our headquarters in massachusetts from cambridge to boston and maintained a liability related to these activities of $33.4 million as of december 31, 2014. our initial estimate of our liabilities for net ongoing costs associated with these facility obligations are recorded at fair value. in estimating the expenses and liabilities related to these facilities, we utilize probability-weighted discounted cash-flows of our ongoing lease obligations. in estimating the expense and liability under our lease obligations, we estimate (i) the costs to be incurred to satisfy rental and build-out commitments under the lease (including operating costs), (ii) the lead-time necessary to sublease the space, (iii) the projected sublease rental rates and (iv) the anticipated durations of subleases. we use a credit-adjusted risk-free rate to discount the estimated cash flows.
we review our estimates and assumptions on at least a quarterly basis. we intend to continue such reviews until the termination of these facility lease obligations and will make whatever modifications we believe are necessary, based on our best judgment, to reflect any changed circumstances. our estimates have changed in the past, and may change in the future, resulting in additional adjustments to the estimate of these liabilities. changes to our estimate of these liabilities are recorded as additional restructuring expenses (credits). in addition, because our estimate of these liabilities includes the application of
65
a discount rate to reflect the time-value of money, we record imputed interest costs related to these liabilities each quarter. these costs are included in restructuring expenses on our consolidated statements of operations.
recent accounting pronouncements refer to note a, "nature of business and accounting policies," in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. there were no new accounting pronouncements adopted during 2014 that had a material effect on our financial statements.

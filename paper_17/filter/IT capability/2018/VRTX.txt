item 1a. risk factors risk factors investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk, and you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10-k. if any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer, possibly materially. in that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline.
risks related to our business all of our product revenues and the vast majority of our total revenues are derived from sales of medicines for the treatment of cystic fibrosis. if we are unable to continue to increase revenues from sales of our cystic fibrosis medicines, our business would be materially harmed and the market price of our common stock would likely decline.
our net product revenues and the vast majority of our total revenues are derived from the sale of cf medicines. symdeko/symkevi, orkambi and kalydeco net product revenues represented approximately 25%, 41% and 33% of our total revenues in the year ended december 31, 2018, respectively. as a result, our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to increase revenues from sales of our cf medicines. in the near term, this will require us to increase cf net product revenues from our current medicines and in the longer term, this will require us to successfully develop, obtain approval for and commercialize at least one triple combination therapy that will allow us to treat f508del/min patients and to improve the treatment options available to patients with cf who are eligible for our current medicines.
our concentrated source of revenues presents a number of risks to our business, including:
•   that one or more competing therapies may successfully be developed as a treatment for patients with cf;
•   that we may experience adverse developments with respect to development or commercialization of our cf medicines and/or cf drug candidates; and
•   that reimbursement policies of payors and other third parties may make it difficult to obtain reimbursement or reduce the net price we receive for our products.
if one or more of the above risks were to materialize, if we are otherwise unable to increase revenues from sales of our cf medicines or if we do not meet the expectations of investors or public equity market analysts, our business would be materially harmed and our stock price would likely decline.
we are investing significant resources in the development of our next-generation cftr corrector compounds in triple combinations and if we are unable to show the safety and efficacy of these regimens, experience delays in doing so or are unable to successfully commercialize at least one of these medicines, our business would be materially harmed.
we are investing significant resources in the development of our next-generation cftr corrector compounds, vx-659 and vx-445, which are currently being evaluated in phase 3 clinical development as part of separate triple combination treatment regimens for patients with cf. we believe that a significant portion of the long-term value attributed to our company by investors is based on the commercial potential of these triple combination therapies. while we believe, based on data, including interim data, from the ongoing vx-659 phase 3 clinical trials and the status of the ongoing vx-445 clinical trials, that we will be able to submit an nda to the fda for a triple combination regimen no later than mid-2019, there can be no assurances that the data will be sufficient to submit an nda on this timeline, or at all.
clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations and, even if we view data as sufficient to support the safety, effectiveness and/or approval of a triple combination regimen, regulatory authorities may disagree and may require additional data, may limit the scope of the approval or may deny approval altogether. furthermore, interim results of a clinical trial may differ materially from final results from such clinical trials. if the final data from our ongoing phase 3 clinical trials are not favorable, the fda and comparable foreign regulatory authorities may not approve these treatment regimens and/or we may be forced to delay or terminate the development of these treatment regimens, which would have an adverse effect on our business. even successfully completed large-scale clinical trials may not result in marketable medicines. if a triple combination fails to achieve its primary endpoint in clinical trials, if safety issues arise, or if the results from our clinical trials are otherwise inadequate to support regulatory approval of our triple combination therapies, commercialization of that combination regimen could be delayed or halted.
even if we gain marketing approval for one or more combination therapies containing a next-generation cftr corrector compound in a timely manner, we cannot be sure that such combination therapy will be commercially successful. in addition, since we expect that a significant portion of the patients for whom a triple combination treatment regimen would be indicated would also be eligible for our then-existing medicines, a portion of the revenues from our triple combination regimens will likely displace revenues from our then-marketed products, reducing the overall positive effect of the commercialization of our triple combination regimens on our total revenues.
if the anticipated or actual timing of marketing approvals for these triple combination regimens, or the market acceptance of these triple combination regimens, if approved, including treatment reimbursement levels agreed to by third-party payors, do not meet the expectations of investors or public market analysts, the market price of our common stock would likely decline.
we have experienced challenges commercializing products outside of the united states, and our future revenues will be dependent on our ability to obtain adequate reimbursement for our products.
in most ex-u.s. markets, the pricing and reimbursement of therapeutic and other pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control. given recent global economic pressures and geopolitical uncertainty, government authorities throughout the world are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of drug products. the reimbursement process in ex-u.s. markets can take a significant period of time and reimbursement decisions are made on a country-by-country basis.
our medicines treat life-threatening conditions and address relatively small patient populations and our research and development programs are primarily focused on developing medicines to treat similar diseases. particular attention is being paid by payors, including government and private payors, to these types of medicines given the relative higher cost of these products as compared to other types of pharmaceutical products - and countries are increasingly refusing to reimburse costly medicines. as a result, we have recognized limited ex-u.s. net product revenues for orkambi in various countries outside the united states, including the united kingdom and france, both of which represent significant potential markets for orkambi. our future product revenues, including from orkambi, symkevi and our triple combination regimens, if approved, depend on, among other things, our ability to complete reimbursement discussions in ex-u.s. markets for our products. there is no assurance that coverage and reimbursement will be available outside of the united states and, even if it is available, whether the timing or the level of reimbursement will be sufficient to allow us to market our medicines. adverse pricing limitations or a delay in obtaining coverage and reimbursement would decrease our future net product revenues and harm our business.
if our competitors bring drugs with superior product profiles to market, our drugs may not be competitive and our revenues could decline.
a number of companies are seeking to identify and develop drug candidates for the treatment of cf, including abbvie, eloxx pharmaceuticals, proqr therapeutics, proteostasis therapeutics, translate bio, and several private companies. our competitors have research and development programs directed at identifying cftr potentiators, cftr correctors, enac inhibitors and drug candidates with other mechanisms of action or that utilize new therapeutic approaches that seek to address the underlying cause of cf. our success in rapidly developing and commercializing our cf products may increase the resources that our competitors allocate to the development of these potential treatments for cf. our competitors are exploring the development of drug candidates both as monotherapies and as part of combination regimens. if one or more competing therapies are successfully developed as a treatment for patients with cf, our products and our cf net product revenues could face competitive pressures. if one or more competing therapies prove to be superior to our then existing products and/or drug candidates for the treatment of cf, our business would be materially adversely affected.
in addition, our business faces competition from major pharmaceutical companies, such as abbvie, bristol-myers squibb, gilead, johnson & johnson, merck, novartis, pfizer, sanofi and roche, which possess substantially greater financial resources than we possess, and numerous smaller public and private companies, academic institutions, government agencies, public and private research organizations and charitable venture philanthropy organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and/or establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. as an example of how competition has affected our business in the past, in 2013 and 2014 we experienced a rapid decline in the number of patients being treated with incivek, a product we previously marketed for the treatment of hepatitis c virus infection, as a result of competition from a treatment regimen identified by a small biotechnology company and developed and commercialized by gilead.
mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. smaller and other early-stage companies also may prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. these third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
our products and any drugs that we develop in the future may not be able to compete effectively with marketed drugs or new drugs that may be developed by competitors. the risk of competition is particularly important to our company because substantially all of our revenues as well as our most advanced drug candidates are related to the treatment of patients with cf. there are many other companies developing drugs for the same indications that we are pursuing. in order to compete successfully in these areas, we must demonstrate improved safety, efficacy and/or tolerability, ease of manufacturing, and gain and maintain market acceptance over competing drugs.
if we discover safety issues with any of our products or if we fail to comply with continuing u.s. and applicable foreign regulations, commercialization efforts for the product could be negatively affected, the approved product could lose its approval or sales could be suspended, and our business could be materially harmed.
our products are subject to continuing regulatory oversight, including the review of additional safety information. drugs are more widely used by patients once approval has been obtained and therefore side effects and other problems may be observed after approval that were not seen or anticipated, or were not as prevalent or severe, during pre-approval clinical trials or nonclinical studies. the subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with a product could negatively affect commercial sales of the product, result in restrictions on the product or lead to the withdrawal of the product from the market. each of our commercial products and our triple combination treatment regimens contain ivacaftor or vx-561, a deuterated version of ivacaftor. as a result, if any of our products or drug candidates were to experience safety issues, our other commercial products as well as one or more of our drug candidates, may be adversely affected. the reporting of adverse safety events involving our products or public speculation about such events could cause our stock price to decline or experience periods of volatility.
in addition, we and our third-party manufacturers must comply with cgmp and other applicable regulations governing the manufacturing and distribution of our products. regulatory authorities periodically inspect our drug manufacturing facilities, and those of our third-party manufacturers, to evaluate compliance with cgmp requirements.
if we or our collaborators, or third-parties acting on our behalf, fail to comply with applicable continuing regulatory requirements, we or our collaborators may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals for specific products, product recalls and seizures, operating restrictions and/or criminal prosecutions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.
if physicians and patients do not accept our drugs, or if patients do not remain on treatment or comply with the prescribed dosing regimen, our product revenues would be materially harmed in future periods.
our drugs may not gain or maintain market acceptance among physicians and patients. effectively marketing our drugs and any of our drug candidates, if approved, requires substantial efforts, both prior to launch and after approval. physicians may elect not to prescribe our drugs, and patients may elect not to take them or may discontinue use of our drugs after initiation of treatment, for a variety of reasons including:
•   prevalence and severity of adverse side effects;
•   lack of reimbursement availability from third-party payors, including governmental entities;
•   lower demonstrated efficacy, safety and/or tolerability compared to alternative treatment methods;
•   lack of cost-effectiveness;
•   a decision to wait for the approval of other therapies in development that have significant perceived advantages over our drug;
•   other potential advantages of alternative treatment methods; and
•   ineffective sales, marketing and/or distribution support.
if our drugs fail to achieve or maintain market acceptance, we may not be able to generate significant revenues in future periods.
government and other third-party payors seek to contain costs of health care through legislative and other means. if they fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement rates for our products, our revenues will be harmed.
our sales of products depend in part upon the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. third-party payors include government health programs such as medicare and medicaid in the united states and the national health care systems in many international markets, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. the trend in the health care industry is cost containment and efforts of third-party payors to contain or reduce health care costs may adversely affect our ability to establish or maintain appropriate prices for our products or any drugs that we may develop and commercialize. in most ex-u.s. markets, the pricing and reimbursement of therapeutic and other pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control and such government authorities are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of drug products. in the united states, there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to implement governmental controls that are similar to those that currently exist in europe. for example, the aca required manufacturers of medicare part d brand name drugs to provide discounts on those drugs to medicare part d beneficiaries during the coverage gap; increased the rebates paid by pharmaceutical companies to state medicaid programs on drugs covered by medicaid; and imposed an annual fee, which increases annually, on sales by branded pharmaceutical manufacturers.
third-party payors throughout the world also have been attempting to control drug spending through various other actions. in reimbursement negotiations, many payers are demanding price discounts and limiting both the types and variety of drugs that they will cover if they are not able to secure them. as part of these negotiations, international government payers also are requiring companies to establish product "cost-effectiveness" as a condition of reimbursement. these cost-effectiveness reviews frequently are subjective, may not account for many of the benefits provided by innovative medicines, and have led to conclusions that certain medicines, including our products in certain jurisdictions, are not worth their price. as a result, certain countries have declined to reimburse some of our products. although not mandated in the united states, various organizations have started advocating for cost-effectiveness analyses in the united states as well. notably, if u.s. payors were to adopt such assessments and make corresponding (negative) coverage determinations, we could expect to see a decrease in our future net product revenues, which could harm our business.
there is also an increase in laws, regulations, and activity related to drug pricing and drug pricing transparency. in the united states, various states, including nevada, maryland, louisiana, new york, california, and oregon, have passed legislation requiring companies to disclose significant amounts of information, including information relating to drug prices, drug price increases, and spending on research, development, and marketing. although it is not clear what states ultimately will do with the information collected, some laws were designed to obtain additional product discounts, and we likely will continue to see more state action, which could require further disclosures or other actions.
complying with these laws requires significant personnel and operational resources and deters focus on our business. additionally, any additional required discounts would adversely affect the pricing of, and revenues from, our products. finally, while we seek to comply with all statutory and regulatory requirements, we face increased enforcement activity by the u.s. federal government, state governments, and private payors against pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for pricing and reimbursement-related issues.
in addition, in the united states and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals and initiatives to change the health care system in ways that could affect our ability to sell products. for example, in the united states, there have been ongoing federal legislative and administrative efforts as well as legal challenges seeking to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the aca. tax legislation enacted at the end of 2017 eliminated the tax penalty for individuals who do not maintain sufficient health insurance coverage beginning in 2019. the bipartisan budget act of 2018 contained various provisions that affect coverage and reimbursement of drugs, including an increase in the discount that manufacturers of medicare part d brand name drugs must provide to medicare part d beneficiaries during the coverage gap from 50% to 70% starting in 2019. as a result, there is uncertainty regarding future changes in the laws and regulations applicable to the health care system and the effect any such changes may have on our business. some of these proposed and implemented reforms have resulted, or could result, in reduced reimbursement rates and/or more limited access for our current or future products, which would adversely affect our business, operations and financial results.
the increasing availability and use of innovative specialty pharmaceuticals, combined with their relative higher cost as compared to other types of pharmaceutical products, is beginning to generate significant third-party payor interest in developing cost-containment strategies targeted to this sector. government regulations in both u.s. and ex-u.s. markets could limit the prices that can be charged for our products and may limit our commercial opportunity. the increasing use of health technology assessments in markets around the world and the financial challenges faced by many governments may lead to significant adverse effects on our business.
any legislation or regulatory changes or relaxation of laws that restrict imports of drugs from other countries, revisions to reimbursement or pharmaceuticals under government programs or general budget control actions also could reduce the net price we receive for our products.
if regulatory authorities interpret any of our conduct, including our marketing practices, as being in violation of applicable health care laws, including fraud and abuse laws, laws prohibiting off-label promotion, disclosure laws or other similar laws, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties.
we are subject to health care fraud and abuse laws, such as the federal false claims act and the anti-kickback provisions of the federal social security act, laws prohibiting off-label product promotion and other similar laws and regulations both in united states and in non-u.s. markets. while we have a corporate compliance program designed to actively identify, prevent and mitigate risk through the implementation of compliance policies and systems and the promotion of a culture of compliance, if we are found not to be in full compliance with these laws and regulations, our business could be materially harmed.
the federal anti-kickback law prohibits knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the ordering, furnishing, arranging for or recommending of an item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a federal health care program, such as medicare or medicaid. the federal statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, patients, purchasers and formulary managers on the other hand, and therefore constrains our marketing practices and our various service arrangements with physicians, including physicians who make clinical decisions to use our products. although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and have been interpreted by courts as such.
federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of alleged promotional and marketing activities, such as providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product; reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then used by federal programs to set reimbursement rates; engaging in promotion for uses that the fda has not approved, known as "off-label" uses, that caused claims to be submitted to medicaid for non-covered off-label uses; submitting inflated "best price" information to the medicaid rebate program; and certain manufacturing-related violations. the scope of this and other laws may expand in ways that make compliance more difficult and expensive.
although physicians are permitted, based on their medical judgment, to prescribe products for indications other than those approved by the fda, manufacturers are prohibited from promoting their products for such off-label uses. we market our products to eligible cf patients for whom the applicable product has been approved and provide promotional materials and training programs to physicians regarding the use of each product in these patient populations. these eligible patients represent only a portion of the total patients with cf. if the fda determines that our promotional materials, training or other activities constitute off-label promotion, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or other activities, conduct corrective advertising or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions, including the issuance of a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine and criminal penalties. it also is possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they believe that the alleged improper promotion led to the submission and payment of claims for an off-label use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. even if it is later determined we were not in violation of these laws, we may be faced with negative publicity, incur significant expenses defending our actions and have to divert significant management resources from other matters.
in recent years, legislation has been adopted at the federal, state and local level requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports or make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials, health care provider payments and other activities. for example, as part of the aca, the federal government enacted the open payments (referred to as the sunshine act) provisions. open payments requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to report annually to the centers for medicare and medicaid services payments or other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals (and additional categories of health care practitioners beginning with reports submitted on or after january 1, 2022). we also now have similar reporting obligations throughout the european union, or the e.u. we expended significant efforts to establish, and are continuing to devote significant resources to maintain and enhance, systems and processes in order to comply with these regulations. requirements to track and disclose financial interactions with health care providers and organizations increase government and public scrutiny of these financial interactions. failure to comply with the reporting requirements would result in significant civil monetary penalties.
the sales and marketing practices of our industry have been the subject of increased scrutiny from governmental entities in the united sates and other countries in which we market our products, and we believe that this trend will continue. the risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are subject to a variety of interpretations. if our past or present operations are found to be in violation of any such laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from federal health care programs and/or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against them, also could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management's attention from the operation of our business.
there is also enhanced scrutiny of company-sponsored patient assistance programs, including insurance premium and co-pay assistance programs and donations to third party charities that provide such assistance. if we, or our vendors or donation recipients are deemed to fail to comply with relevant laws, regulations or government guidance in the operation of these programs, we could be subject to significant fines and penalties.
if we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the medicaid drug rebate program or other governmental pricing programs in the u.s., we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.
we participate in the medicaid drug rebate program and a number of other federal and state government pricing programs in the u.s. in order to obtain coverage for the product by certain government health care programs. these programs would generally require us to pay rebates or provide discounts to certain private purchasers or government payers in connection with our products when dispensed to beneficiaries of these programs. in some cases, such as with the medicaid drug rebate program, the rebates are based on pricing and rebate calculations that we report on a monthly and quarterly basis to the government agencies that administer the programs. the terms, scope and complexity of these government pricing programs change frequently. we may also have reimbursement obligations or be subject to penalties if we fail to provide timely and accurate information to the government, pay the correct rebates or offer the correct discounted pricing. changes to the price reporting or rebate requirements of these programs would affect our obligations to pay rebates or offer discounts. responding to current and future changes may increase our costs and the complexity of compliance, will be time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
changes in laws and regulations governing the privacy and protection of data and personal information could adversely affect our business.
we are subject to data privacy and protection laws and regulations that apply to the collection, transmission, storage and use of proprietary information and personally-identifying information, which among other things, impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. in addition, numerous other federal and state laws, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, disclosure and security of personal information. various foreign countries also have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use, disclosure, security, and cross-border transmission of personal information. the legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business. for example, the e.u. general data protection regulation went into effect in may 2018 and has imposed new obligations on us with respect to our processing of personal data and the cross-border transfer of such data. while we continue to address the implications of the recent changes to e.u. data privacy regulations, data privacy remains an evolving landscape at both the domestic and international level, with new regulations coming into effect and continued legal challenges and our efforts to comply with the evolving data protection rules may be unsuccessful. we must devote significant resources to understanding and complying with this changing landscape. failure to comply with laws regarding data protection would expose us to risk of enforcement actions taken by data protection authorities in the e.u. and the potential for significant penalties if we are found to be non-compliant. similarly, failure to comply with federal and state laws in the united states regarding privacy and security of personal information could expose us to penalties under such laws. even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could harm our business.
the ema has adopted a policy on publication of clinical data whereby it will publish clinical reports submitted as part of maas for drugs. the ema aims to publish reports within 60 days after a decision on the application has been made by the european commission. the ability of third-parties to review and/or analyze the raw data from our clinical trials may increase the risk of patient confidentiality breaches and could result in enhanced scrutiny of our clinical trials results. such scrutiny could result in misconceptions being spread about our drugs and drug candidates, even if the underlying analysis of such review turns out to be flawed. these publications could also result in the disclosure of information to our competitors that we might otherwise deem confidential, which could harm our competitive position.
the use of social media platforms presents risks and challenges.
social media is being used by third parties to communicate about our products and drug candidates and the diseases our therapies are designed to treat. we believe that members of the cf community may be more active on social media as compared to other patient populations due to the demographics of this patient population. social media practices in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are evolving, which creates uncertainty and risk of noncompliance with regulations applicable to our business. for example, patients may use social media platforms to comment on the effectiveness of, or adverse experiences with, a drug or a drug candidate, which could result in reporting obligations. in addition, our employees may engage on social media in ways that may not comply with our social media policy or with legal or regulatory requirements, which may give rise to liability, lead to the loss of trade secrets and other intellectual property, or result in public disclosure of protected personal information. there is a risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us on any social networking website. if any of these events were to occur or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could incur liability, face restrictive regulatory actions or incur other harm to our business, including damage to our reputation.
risks related to development, clinical testing and regulation of our products and drug candidates our drug candidates remain subject to clinical testing and regulatory approval. our future success is dependent on our ability to successfully develop additional drug candidates for both cf and non-cf indications.
our business depends upon the successful development and commercialization of drug candidates. these drug candidates are in various stages of development and must satisfy rigorous standards of safety and efficacy before they can be approved for sale by the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. to satisfy these standards, we must allocate resources among our various development programs and must engage in expensive and lengthy testing of our drug candidates. discovery and development efforts for new pharmaceutical products, including new combination therapies, are resource-intensive and may take 10 to 15 years or longer for each drug candidate. despite our efforts, our drug candidates may not:
•   offer therapeutic or other improvement over existing competitive therapies;
•   show the level of safety and efficacy, including the level of statistical significance, required by the fda or other regulatory authorities for approval of a drug candidate;
•   meet applicable regulatory standards;
•   be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at acceptable costs; or
•   if approved for commercial sale, be successfully marketed as pharmaceutical products.
we have recently completed and/or have ongoing or planned clinical trials for several of our drug candidates. the strength of our company's product portfolio and pipeline will depend in large part upon the outcomes of these clinical trials and our ability to develop and commercialize combination treatments for cf, including our next-generation cftr corrector compounds and develop treatments for other diseases. results of our clinical trials and findings from our nonclinical studies, including toxicology findings in nonclinical studies conducted concurrently with clinical trials, could lead to abrupt changes in our development activities, including the possible cessation of development activities associated with a particular drug candidate or program. for example, in 2018 we discontinued development of vx-210 based on a recommendation by the data safety monitoring board, or dsmb, to stop a clinical trial early due to futility.
moreover, clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations, and many companies that have believed their drug candidates performed satisfactorily in clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their drug candidate. furthermore, results from our clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance or otherwise provide the level of evidence or safety and efficacy required by the fda or other regulatory authorities for approval of a drug candidate.
many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including our company, have suffered significant setbacks in later-stage clinical trials even after achieving promising results in earlier-stage clinical trials. accordingly, the results from completed preclinical studies and clinical trials may not be replicated in later clinical trials, and ongoing clinical trials for our drug candidates may not be predictive of the results we may obtain in later-stage clinical trials or of the likelihood of approval of a drug candidate for commercial sale. in addition, from time to time we report interim data from our clinical trials. interim data from a clinical trial may not be predictive of final results from the clinical trial.
if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval, we will be unable to commercialize our drug candidates.
the time required to complete clinical trials and to satisfy the fda and other countries' regulatory review processes is uncertain and typically takes many years. our analysis of data obtained from nonclinical and clinical activities is subject to confirmation and interpretation by regulatory authorities, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. we also may encounter unanticipated delays or increased costs due to government regulation from future legislation or administrative action or changes in governmental policy during the period of drug development, clinical trials and governmental regulatory review.
we may seek a fast track and/or breakthrough therapy designation for some of our drug candidates. drug candidates that receive one or both of these designations may be eligible for, among other things, a priority regulatory review. each of these designations is within the discretion of the fda. accordingly, even if we believe one of our drug candidates meets the criteria for fast track and/or breakthrough therapy designation, the fda may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. the receipt of one or both of these designations for a drug candidate does not guarantee a faster development process, review or approval compared to drugs developed or considered for approval under conventional fda procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the fda. in addition, even if one or more of our drugs or drug candidates qualifies for fast track and/or breakthrough therapy designation, the fda may later decide to withdraw such designation if it determines that the drug or drug candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification.
any failure to obtain regulatory approvals for a drug candidate would prevent us from commercializing that drug candidate. any delay in obtaining required regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our ability to successfully commercialize a drug candidate. furthermore, any regulatory approval to market a drug may be subject to limitations that we do not expect on the indicated uses for which we may market the drug. any such limitations could reduce the size of the market for the drug.
we also are subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing authorization, pricing and third-party reimbursement. non-u.s. jurisdictions have different approval procedures than those required by the fda, and these jurisdictions may impose additional testing requirements for our drug candidates. the foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with the fda approval process described above, as well as risks attributable to the satisfaction of foreign requirements. approval by the fda does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities outside the united states and approval by a foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by the fda. in addition, although the fda may accept data from clinical trials conducted outside the united states, acceptance of this data is subject to conditions imposed by the fda. for example, the clinical trial must be well designed and conducted and performed by qualified investigators in accordance with ethical principles. the trial population also must adequately represent the u.s. population, and the data must be applicable to the u.s. population and u.s. medical practice in ways that the fda deems clinically meaningful. in addition, while these clinical trials are subject to the applicable local laws, fda acceptance of the data will depend on its determination that the trials also complied with all applicable u.s. laws and regulations. if the fda does not accept the data from any trial that we conduct outside the united states, it would likely result in the need for additional trials, which would be costly and time-consuming and delay or permanently halt our development of the applicable drug candidate.
if clinical trials are prolonged or delayed, our development timelines for the affected development program could be extended, our costs to develop the drug candidate could increase and the competitive position of the drug candidate could be adversely affected.
we cannot predict whether or not we will encounter problems with any of our completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials that will cause us or regulatory authorities to delay or suspend clinical trials, or delay the analysis of data from our completed or ongoing clinical trials. among the factors that could delay our development programs are:
•   ongoing discussions with the fda or comparable foreign authorities regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials and the number of clinical trials we must conduct;
•   delays in enrolling volunteers or patients into clinical trials, including as a result of low numbers of patients that meet the eligibility criteria for the trial;
•   the need to repeat clinical trials as a result of inconclusive results, unforeseen complications in testing or clinical investigator error;
•   inadequate supply or deficient quality of drug candidate materials or other materials necessary for the conduct of our clinical trials;
•   unfavorable fda or foreign regulatory authority inspection and review of a manufacturing facility that supplied clinical trial materials or its relevant manufacturing records or a clinical trial site or records of any clinical or preclinical investigation;
•   serious and unexpected drug-related side-effects experienced by participants in our clinical trials or by participants in clinical trials being conducted by our competitors to evaluate drug candidates with similar mechanisms of action or structures to drug candidates that we are developing;
•   favorable results in testing of our competitors' drug candidates, or fda or foreign regulatory authority approval of our competitors' drug candidates; or
•   action by the fda or a foreign regulatory authority to place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on a trial or compound or deeming the clinical trial conduct as problematic.
our ability to enroll patients in our clinical trials in sufficient numbers and on a timely basis is subject to a number of factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the availability of effective treatments for the relevant disease, the number of other clinical trials ongoing and competing for patients in the same indication and the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial. in addition, patients may drop out of our clinical trials or may be lost to follow-up medical evaluation after treatment ends, and this could impair the validity or statistical significance of the trials. delays in patient enrollment or unforeseen drop-out rates may result in increased costs and longer development times.
we, our collaborators, the fda or other applicable regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials of a drug candidate at any time if we or they believe the healthy volunteers or patients participating in such clinical trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or for other reasons. any such suspension could materially adversely affect the development of a particular drug candidate and our business.
if our processes and systems are not compliant with regulatory requirements, we could be subject to restrictions on marketing our products or could be delayed in submitting regulatory filings seeking approvals for our drug candidates.
we have a number of regulated processes and systems that are required both prior to and following approval of our drugs and drug candidates. these processes and systems are subject to continual review and periodic inspection by the fda and other regulatory bodies. in addition, the clinical research organizations and other third parties that we work with in our non-clinical studies and clinical trials and our oversight of such parties are subject to similar reviews and periodic inspection by the fda and other regulatory bodies. if compliance issues are identified at any point in the development and approval process, we may experience delays in filing for regulatory approval for our drug candidates, or delays in obtaining regulatory approval after filing, if at all. any later discovery of previously unknown problems or safety issues with approved drugs or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in restrictions on such drugs or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of drugs from the market, the imposition of civil or criminal penalties or a refusal by the fda and/or other regulatory bodies to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new drugs or supplements to approved applications, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. in addition, we are party to agreements that transfer responsibility for complying with specified regulatory requirements, such as filing and maintenance of marketing authorizations and safety reporting or compliance with manufacturing requirements, to our collaborators and third-party manufacturers. if our collaborators or third-party manufacturers do not fulfill these regulatory obligations, any drugs for which we or they obtain approval may be subject to later restrictions on manufacturing or sale, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
risks related to collaborations and other business development activities our ability to execute on our long-term strategy depends in part on our ability to acquire rights to additional drugs, drug candidates and other technologies that have the potential to add to our pipeline or provide us with new commercial opportunities.
in order to achieve our long-term business objectives, our strategy is to supplement our internal pipeline by acquiring rights to additional drugs, drug candidates and other technologies that have the potential to provide us with new commercial opportunities, including in cf and in therapeutic areas outside of cf. we may not be able to acquire, in-license or otherwise obtain rights to additional drugs, drug candidates or other technologies on acceptable terms or at all. we have faced and will continue to face significant competition for the acquisition of rights to these types of drugs, drug candidates and other technologies from a variety of other companies with interests in the specialty pharmaceutical marketplace, many of which have significantly more financial resources and experience in business development activities than we have. in addition, non-profit organizations may be willing to provide capital to the companies that control additional drugs, drug candidates or technologies, which may provide incentives for companies to advance these drugs, drug candidates or technologies independently. because of these competitive pressures, the cost of acquiring, in-licensing or otherwise obtaining rights to such drugs, drug candidates or other technologies has grown dramatically in recent years and may be at levels that we cannot afford or that we believe are not justified by market potential. this competition is most intense for approved drugs and late-stage drug candidates, which have the lowest risk and would have the most immediate effect on our financial performance.
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of potential acquisitions or licenses to businesses, drugs, drug candidates and other technologies, and the integration following any such acquisition or license may disrupt our business and management.
we may acquire a business or the rights to drugs, drug candidates or other technologies. in recent years we have entered into both acquisition and collaboration arrangements, including our acquisition of vx-561 from concert, our agreement with crispr to collaborate on the discovery and development of potential new treatments aimed at the underlying genetic causes of human diseases using crispr-cas9 gene editing technology and our collaboration agreement with moderna, pursuant to which we are seeking to identify and develop mrna therapeutics for the treatment of cf. with respect to each of these transactions and any additional acquisition of a business or rights to drugs, drug candidates or other technologies, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such transaction, each of which involves numerous risks. these risks include:
•   failure to successfully develop and commercialize the drugs, drug candidates or technologies that we acquire or license or to achieve other strategic objectives;
•   inadequate or unfavorable data from clinical trials evaluating the acquired or licensed drug or drug candidates;
•   entry into markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience or where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions;
•   disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and employees from other opportunities and challenges;
•   potential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired company, or acquired or licensed drug, drug candidate or technology, including but not limited to, problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges with respect to intellectual property, product quality, safety, accounting practices, employee, customer or third party relations and other known and unknown liabilities;
•   liability for activities of the acquired company or licensor before the acquisition or license, including intellectual property infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities;
•   exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of an acquisition or license, including but not limited to, claims from terminated employees, customers, former equity holders or other third-parties;
•   difficulty in integrating the drugs, drug candidates, technologies, business operations and personnel of an acquired asset or company; and
•   difficulties in the integration of the acquired company's departments, systems, including accounting, human resource and other administrative systems, technologies, books and records, and procedures, as well as in maintaining uniform standards, controls, including internal control over financial reporting required by the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 and related procedures and policies.
acquisitions and licensing arrangements are inherently risky, and ultimately, if we do not complete an announced acquisition or license transaction or integrate an acquired business, or an acquired or licensed drug, drug candidate or other technology successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition or license to the extent anticipated and the perception of the effectiveness of our management team and our company may suffer in the marketplace. additionally, we may later incur impairment charges related to assets acquired in any such transaction. for example, we entered into a strategic collaboration and license agreement with parion sciences, inc., or parion, to develop enac inhibitors in 2015 and incurred an impairment charge related to this collaboration in the third quarter of 2017. in addition, even if we achieve the long-term benefits associated with strategic transactions, our expenses and short-term costs may increase materially and adversely affect our liquidity and short-term net income (loss). future licenses or acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, the creation of contingent liabilities, impairment expenses related to goodwill, and impairment or amortization expenses related to other intangible assets, which could harm our financial condition.
we face risks in connection with existing and future collaborations with respect to the development, manufacture and commercialization of our products and drug candidates.
the risks that we face in connection with our current collaborations, including with arbor, crispr, janssen and moderna, and any future collaborations, include the following:
•   our collaborators may change the focus of their development and commercialization efforts or may have insufficient resources to effectively develop our drug candidates. the ability of some of our products and drug candidates to reach their potential could be limited if collaborators decrease or fail to increase development or commercialization efforts related to those products or drug candidates. our collaboration agreements provide our collaborators with a level of discretion in determining the amount and timing of efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations.
•   any future collaboration agreements may have the effect of limiting the areas of research and development that we may pursue, either alone or in collaboration with third parties.
•   collaborators may develop and commercialize, either alone or with others, drugs that are similar to or competitive with the drugs or drug candidates that are the subject of their collaborations with us.
•   disagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development, might cause delays or termination of the research, development or commercialization of drug candidates, might lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to drug candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration. any such disagreements would divert management attention and resources and be time-consuming and expensive.
•   collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation.
•   collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability.
•   investigations and/or compliance or enforcement actions against a collaborator, which may expose us to indirect liability as a result of our partnership with such collaborator.
additionally, if a collaborator were to be involved in a business combination, it might deemphasize or terminate the development or commercialization of any drug candidate licensed to it by us. if one of our collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may find it more difficult to attract new collaborators and our perception in the business and financial communities could be harmed.
we may not be able to attract collaborators or external funding for the development and commercialization of certain of our drug candidates.
as part of our ongoing strategy, we may seek additional collaborative arrangements or external funding for certain of our development programs and/or seek to expand existing collaborations to cover additional commercialization and/or development activities. we have a number of research programs and early-stage clinical development programs, some of which are being developed in collaboration with a third party. for example, we have an ongoing collaboration with janssen, pursuant to which janssen is developing drug candidates that resulted from our research activities. at any time, we may determine that in order to continue development of a drug candidate or program or successfully commercialize a drug we need to identify a collaborator or amend or expand an existing collaboration. whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator's resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator's evaluation of a number of factors. those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the fda or similar regulatory authorities outside the united states, the potential market for the subject drug candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such drug candidate to patients, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of the applicable intellectual property, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge, and industry and market conditions generally. potentially, and depending on the circumstances, we may desire that a collaborator either agree to fund portions of a drug development program led by us, or agree to provide all of the funding and directly lead the development and commercialization of a program. no assurance can be given that any efforts we make to seek additional collaborative arrangements will be successfully completed on a timely basis or at all. if we elect to fund and undertake development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. if we are unable to enter into acceptable collaborative relationships, one or more of our development programs could be delayed or terminated and the possibility of our receiving a return on our investment in the program could be impaired.
risks related to third-party manufacturing and reliance on third parties we depend on third-party manufacturers to manufacture our products and the materials we require for our clinical trials. we may not be able to maintain these relationships and could experience supply disruptions outside of our control.
we rely on a worldwide network of third-party manufacturers to manufacture our drugs for commercial use and our drug candidates for clinical trials. as a result of our reliance on these third-party manufacturers and suppliers, we could be subject to significant supply disruptions outside of our control. our supply chain for sourcing raw materials and manufacturing drug product ready for distribution is a multi-step international endeavor. third-party contract manufacturers, including some in china, perform different parts of our manufacturing process. contract manufacturers may supply us with raw materials, convert these raw materials into drug substance and/or convert the drug substance into final dosage form. establishing and managing this global supply chain requires a significant financial commitment and the creation and maintenance of numerous third-party contractual relationships. although we attempt to manage the business relationships with companies in our supply chain, we do not have control over their operations. supply disruptions may result from a number of factors, including shortages in product raw materials, labor or technical difficulties, regulatory inspections or restrictions, shipping or customs delays or any other performance failure by any third-party manufacturer on which we rely. any supply disruptions could disrupt sales of our products and/or the timing of our clinical trials.
we require a supply for our medicines for commercial sale and a supply of our drug candidates for use in our clinical trials. while we have developed some internal capabilities, a majority of the manufacturing steps needed to produce our drug candidates and drug products are performed through a third-party manufacturing network. to ensure the stability of our supply chains we aim to develop additional sources of manufacture for all steps of our manufacturing processes at the time of, or shortly after, marketing approval. therefore, at any point in time, we may have a limited number of single source manufacturers for certain steps in our manufacturing processes, particularly for recently launched products.
if we or our third-party manufacturers become unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing product on our behalf and we are not able to promptly identify another manufacturer, we could experience a disruption in the commercial supply of our then-marketed medicines, which would have a significant effect on patients, our business and our product revenues. similarly, a disruption in the clinical supply of drug products could delay the completion of clinical trials and affect timelines for regulatory filings. there can be no assurance that we will be able to establish and maintain secondary manufacturers for all of our drug candidates and drug products on a timely basis or at all.
in the course of providing its services, a contract manufacturer may develop process technology related to the manufacture of our products or drug candidates that the manufacturer owns, either independently or jointly with us. this would increase our reliance on that manufacturer or require us to obtain a license from that manufacturer in order to have our products or drug candidates manufactured by other suppliers utilizing the same process.
we rely on third parties to conduct certain pre-clinical work and clinical trials, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet established deadlines for the completion of such studies and/or trials or failing to satisfy regulatory requirements.
we rely on third parties such as contract research organizations to help manage certain pre-clinical work and our clinical trials and on medical institutions, clinical investigators and clinical research organizations such as the therapeutic development network, which is primarily funded by the cff, to assist in the design and review of, and to conduct our clinical trials, including enrolling qualified patients. our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities but does not relieve us of our responsibilities. for example, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the clinical trial. moreover, the fda requires us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as good laboratory practices and good clinical practices, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of pre-clinical and clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. if these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be required to replace them. although we believe that there are a number of other third-party contractors we could engage to continue these activities, it may result in a delay of the affected clinical trial or drug development program. if clinical trials are not conducted in accordance with our contractual expectations or regulatory requirements, action by regulatory authorities might significantly and adversely affect the conduct or progress of these clinical trials or in specific circumstances might result in a requirement that a clinical trial be redone. accordingly, our efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for and commercialize our drug candidates could be delayed.
risks related to intellectual property if our patents do not protect our drugs or our drugs infringe third-party patents, we could be subject to litigation which could result in injunctions preventing us from selling our products or substantial liabilities.
we have numerous issued patents and pending patent applications in the united states, as well as counterparts in other countries. our success will depend, in significant part, on our ability to obtain and defend u.s. and foreign patents covering our drugs, their uses and our processes, to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. we cannot be certain that any patents will issue from our pending patent applications or, even if patents issue or have issued, that the issued claims will provide us with adequate protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable.
due to evolving legal standards relating to the patentability, validity and enforceability of patents covering pharmaceutical inventions and the scope of claims made under these patents, our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce patents is uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. recent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents in the u.s. the leahy-smith america invents act, or the leahy-smith act, includes a number of significant changes to united states patent law. these include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. the united states patent office developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the leahy-smith act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the leahy-smith act, and in particular, the first to file provisions, became effective in march 2013. the first to file provisions limit the rights of an inventor who is the first to invent an invention but is not the first to file an application claiming that invention. u.s. and foreign patent applications typically are maintained in confidence for a period of time after they initially are filed with the applicable patent office. consequently, we cannot be certain that we were the first to invent, or the first to file patent applications on, our products or drug candidates or their use. if a third party also has filed a u.s. patent application relating to our drugs or drug candidates, their uses, or a similar invention, we may have to participate in legal or administrative proceedings to determine priority of invention. for applications governed by the lahey-smith act, if a third-party has an earlier filed u.s. patent application relating to our drugs or drug candidates, their uses, or a similar invention, we may be unable to obtain an issued patent from our application.
the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability. our patents may be challenged by third parties, resulting in the patent being deemed invalid, unenforceable or narrowed in scope, or the third party may circumvent any such issued patents. also, our pending patent applications may not issue, and we may not receive any additional patents. our patents might not contain claims that are sufficiently broad to prevent others from utilizing our technologies. for instance, the issued patents relating to our drugs or drug candidates may be limited to a particular molecule or molecules and may not cover similar molecules that have similar clinical properties. consequently, our competitors may independently develop competing products that do not infringe our patents or other intellectual property. in addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future products.
the laws of many foreign jurisdictions do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the united states and many companies in our segment of the pharmaceutical industry have encountered significant difficulties in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. if we encounter such difficulties in protecting or are otherwise precluded from effectively protecting our intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions, our business could be substantially harmed.
because of the extensive time required for the discovery, development, testing and regulatory review of drug candidates, it is possible that a patent may expire before a drug candidate can be commercialized, or a patent may expire or remain in effect for only a short period following commercialization of such drug candidate. this would result in a minimal or non-existent period of patent exclusivity. if our drug candidates are not commercialized significantly ahead of the expiration date of any applicable patent, or if we have no patent protection on such drug candidates, then, to the extent available we would rely on other forms of exclusivity, such as regulatory exclusivity provided by the fdca and its counterpart agencies in various jurisdictions, and/or orphan drug exclusivity.
uncertainty over intellectual property in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry has been the source of litigation and other disputes, which is inherently costly and unpredictable.
there is considerable uncertainty within our industry about the validity, scope and enforceability of many issued patents in the united states and elsewhere in the world, and, to date, the law and practice remains in substantial flux both in the agencies that grant patents and in the courts. we cannot currently determine the ultimate scope and validity of patents which may be granted to third parties in the future or which patents might be asserted as being infringed by the manufacture, use and sale of our products.
there has been, and we expect that there may continue to be, significant litigation in the pharmaceutical industry regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. litigation, arbitrations, administrative proceedings and other legal actions with private parties and governmental authorities concerning patents and other intellectual property rights may be protracted, expensive and distracting to management. competitors may sue us as a way of delaying the introduction of our drugs or to remove our drugs from the market. any litigation, including litigation related to abbreviated new drug applications, or anda, litigation related to 505(b)(2) applications, interference proceedings to determine priority of inventions, derivations proceedings, inter partes review, oppositions to patents in foreign countries, litigation against our collaborators or similar actions, may be costly and time consuming and could harm our business. we expect that litigation may be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our proprietary rights. litigation may be necessary in other instances to determine the validity, scope or non-infringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our products. ultimately, the outcome of such litigation could adversely affect the validity and scope of our patent or other proprietary rights, hinder our ability to manufacture and market our products, or result in the assessment of significant monetary damages against us that may exceed amounts, if any, accrued in our financial statements.
to the extent that valid present or future third-party patents or other intellectual property rights cover our drugs, drug candidates or technologies, we or our strategic collaborators may seek licenses or other agreements from the holders of such rights in order to avoid or settle legal claims. such licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, which may hinder our ability to, or prevent us from being able to, manufacture and market our drugs. payments under any licenses that we are able to obtain would reduce our profits derived from the covered products.
many of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee's former employer. litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.
in addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. our and their assignment agreements may not be self-executing or may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.
if we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.
risks related to our operations risks associated with operating in foreign countries could materially adversely affect our business.
we have expanded our international operations over the past several years in order to market our cf medicines and expand our research and development capabilities. new laws and industry codes in the e.u. and elsewhere have expanded transparency requirements regarding payments and transfers of value as well as patient-level clinical trial data. new laws in the e.u. also have expanded protections related to personal data and provided for increased sanctions for violations. collectively, our expansion and these new requirements are adding to our compliance costs and expose us to potential sanctions for failing to meet the enhanced safeguards and reporting demands in these jurisdictions. in addition, a significant portion of our commercial supply chain, including sourcing of raw materials and manufacturing, is located in china and the e.u. consequently, we are, and will continue to be, subject to risks related to operating in foreign countries, including risks relating to intellectual property protections and business interruptions. these risks are increased with respect to countries, such as china, that have substantially different local laws and business practices and weaker protections for intellectual property. risks associated with conducting operations in foreign countries include:
•   differing regulatory requirements for drug approvals and regulation of approved drugs in foreign countries;
•   varying reimbursement regimes and difficulties or the inability to obtain reimbursement for our products in foreign countries in a timely manner;
•   differing patient treatment infrastructures, particularly since our business is focused on the treatment of serious diseases that affect relatively smaller numbers of patients and are typically prescribed by specialist physicians;
•   collectibility of accounts receivable;
•   changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements, the risks of which appear to have increased in the current political environment;
•   economic weakness, including recession and inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;
•   differing levels of enforcement and/or recognition of contractual and intellectual property rights;
•   complying with local laws and regulations, which are interpreted and enforced differently across jurisdictions and which can change significantly over time;
•   foreign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;
•   foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in reduced revenues or increased operating expenses, and other obligations incident to doing business or operating in another country;
•   workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the united states;
•   import and export licensing requirements, tariffs, and other trade and travel restrictions;
•   production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and
•   business interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism.
our revenues are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to the global nature of our operations. although we have foreign currency forward contracts to hedge forecasted product revenues denominated in foreign currencies, our efforts to reduce currency exchange losses may not be successful. as a result, currency fluctuations among our reporting currency, the u.s. dollar, and the currencies in which we do business will affect our operating results, often in unpredictable ways.
in addition, our international operations are subject to regulation under u.s. law. for example, the fcpa prohibits u.s. companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad. in many countries, the health care professionals we regularly interact with may meet the definition of a foreign government official for purposes of the fcpa. we also are subject to import/export control laws. failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences, including the possible delay in approval or refusal to approve a product, recalls, seizures, withdrawal of an approved product from the market, the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions, the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations and corresponding bad publicity and negative perception of our company in foreign countries.
if we fail to manage our operations effectively, our business may suffer.
we have expanded and are continuing to expand our global operations and capabilities, which has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our management and our operational, research and development and financial infrastructure. to effectively manage our business, we need to:
•   implement and clearly communicate our corporate-wide strategies;
•   enhance our operational and financial infrastructure, including our controls over records and information;
•   enhance our operational, financial and management processes, including our cross-functional decision-making processes and our budget prioritization systems;
•   enhance our compliance and legal resources.
risk relating to the referendum of the united kingdom's membership of the european union.
our european headquarters and european research facility are located in the united kingdom, or the u.k., and a significant portion of our ex-u.s. net product revenues are derived from sales in the u.k. in june 2016, the u.k. held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the e.u., commonly referred to as "brexit." the u.k. government provided official notice of withdrawal from the e.u. in march 2017 and has a period of two years from the date of its formal notification (such period ending march 29, 2019) to negotiate the terms of its withdrawal from, and future relationship with, the e.u., including the terms of trade between the u.k. and the e.u. and potentially other countries. if no formal withdrawal agreement is reached, then it is expected that the u.k.'s membership in the e.u. will automatically terminate two years after the submission of the notification of the u.k.'s intention to withdraw from the e.u., unless all remaining member states unanimously consent to an extension of this period. discussions between the u.k. and the e.u. focused on finalizing withdrawal issues and transition agreements are ongoing. however, limited progress to date in these negotiations and ongoing uncertainty within the u.k. government increases the possibility of the u.k. leaving the e.u. on march 29, 2019 without a withdrawal agreement and associated transition period in place, which is likely to cause significant market and economic disruption, which may cause third-party payors, including governmental organizations, to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending budgets. the effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the u.k. makes to retain access to e.u. markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the u.k. determines which e.u. laws to replace or replicate. given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the u.k. from the e.u. would have and how such withdrawal would affect us. any of these effects of brexit, among others, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
our business has a substantial risk of product liability claims and other litigation liability. if we do not obtain appropriate levels of insurance, any potential claims could adversely affect our business.
we are or may be involved in various legal proceedings, including securities class action lawsuits and claims related to product liability, intellectual property and breach of contract. such proceedings may involve claims for, or the possibility of, fines and penalties involving substantial amounts of money or other relief, including but not limited to civil or criminal fines and penalties. if any of these legal proceedings were to result in an adverse outcome, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.
with respect to product liability and clinical trial risks, in the ordinary course of business we are subject to liability claims and lawsuits, including potential class actions, alleging that our products or drug candidates have caused, or could cause, serious adverse events or other injury. we have product liability insurance and clinical trial insurance in amounts that we believe are adequate to cover this risk. however, our insurance may not provide adequate coverage against all potential liabilities. if a claim is brought against us, we might be required to pay legal and other expenses to defend the claim, as well as pay uncovered damage awards resulting from a claim brought successfully against us and these damages could be significant and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. furthermore, whether or not we are ultimately successful in defending any such claims, we might be required to direct significant financial and managerial resources to such defense and adverse publicity is likely to result.
a breakdown or breach of our information technology systems could subject us to liability or interrupt the operation of our business.
we maintain and rely extensively on information technology systems and network infrastructures for the effective operation of our business. in the course of our business, we collect, store and transmit confidential information (including personal information and intellectual property), and it is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information. the size and complexity of our information technology and information security systems makes such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches. a disruption, infiltration or failure of our information technology systems or any of our data centers as a result of software or hardware malfunctions, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, employee theft or misuse, power disruptions, natural disasters, floods or accidents could cause breaches of data security and loss of critical data, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business and subject us to both private and governmental causes of action. while we have implemented security measures in an attempt to minimize these risks to our data and information technology systems and have adopted a business continuity plan to deal with a disruption to our information technology systems, cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and have become increasingly difficult to detect. there can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our data and information systems will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business. in addition, our liability insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyber-attacks or other related liabilities.
if we fail to attract and retain skilled employees, our business could be materially harmed.
because our drug discovery and development activities are highly technical in nature, we require the services of highly qualified and trained scientists who have the skills necessary to conduct these activities. in addition, we need to attract and retain employees with experience in marketing and commercialization of medicines. we have entered into employment agreements with some executives and provide compensation-related benefits to all of our key employees that vest over time and therefore induce them to remain with us. however, the employment agreements can be terminated by the executive on relatively short notice. the value to employees of stock-related benefits that vest over time - such as options and restricted stock units - is significantly affected by movements in our stock price, and may at any point in time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies. we face intense competition for our personnel from our competitors and other companies throughout our industry. we also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. moreover, the growth of local biotechnology companies and the expansion of major pharmaceutical companies into the boston area have increased competition for the available pool of skilled employees, especially in technical fields, and the high cost of living in massachusetts makes it difficult to attract employees from other parts of the country to massachusetts. in addition, the available pool of skilled employees would be further reduced if immigration laws change in a manner that increases restrictions on immigration. our ability to commercialize our products, and achieve our research and development objectives, depends on our ability to respond effectively to these demands. if we are unable to hire and retain qualified personnel, there could be a material adverse effect on our business.
if we do not comply with laws regulating the protection of the environment and health and human safety, our business could be adversely affected.
our research and development efforts involve the regulated use of hazardous materials, chemicals and various controlled and radioactive compounds. although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by state, federal and foreign regulations, the risk of loss of, or accidental contamination or injury from, these materials cannot be eliminated. if an accident occurs, we could be held liable for resulting damages, which could be substantial. we also are subject to numerous environmental, health and workplace safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne pathogens and the handling of biohazardous materials. although we maintain workers' compensation insurance to cover us for costs we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of these materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. we maintain insurance to cover pollution conditions or other extraordinary or unanticipated events relating to our use and disposal of hazardous materials that we believe is appropriate based on the small amount of hazardous materials we generate. additional federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting our operations may be adopted in the future. we may incur substantial costs to comply with, and substantial fines or penalties if we violate, any of these laws or regulations.
if our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, our operations would be seriously harmed.
most of our operations, including our research and development activities, are conducted in a limited number of facilities. if any of our major facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, due to an earthquake, severe storms, fire or similar event, our operations could be seriously harmed. for example, our corporate headquarters, as well as additional leased space that we use for certain logistical and laboratory operations and manufacturing, are located in a flood zone along the massachusetts coast. we have adopted a business continuity plan to address most crises. however, if we are unable to fully implement our business continuity plans, we may experience delays in recovery of data and/or an inability to perform vital corporate functions, which could result in a significant disruption in our research, development, manufacturing and/or commercial activities, large expenses to repair or replace the facility and/or the loss of critical data, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.
market prices for securities of companies such as ours are highly volatile. from january 1, 2018 to december 31, 2018, our common stock traded between $144.07 and $194.92 per share. the market for our stock, like that of other companies in the biotechnology industry, has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. the future market price of our securities could be significantly and adversely affected by factors such as:
•   the information contained in our quarterly earnings releases, including our net product revenues and operating expenses for completed periods and guidance regarding future periods;
•   announcements of fda actions with respect to our drugs or our competitors' drugs, or regulatory filings for our drug candidates or those of our competitors, or announcements of interim or final results of clinical trials or nonclinical studies relating to our drugs, drug candidates or those of our competitors;
•   developments in domestic and international governmental policy or regulation, for example, relating to drug pricing or intellectual property rights;
•   technological innovations or the introduction of new drugs by our competitors;
•   government regulatory action;
•   public concern as to the safety of drugs developed by us or our competitors;
•   developments in patent or other intellectual property rights or announcements relating to these matters;
•   information disclosed by third parties regarding our business or products;
•   developments relating specifically to other companies and market conditions for pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks or stocks in general;
•   business development, capital structuring or financing activities; and
•   general worldwide or national economic, political and capital market conditions.
following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, stockholder derivative lawsuits and securities class action litigation are common. such litigation, if instituted against us or our officers and directors, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources.
our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past, and we expect that they will continue to do so in the future. our revenues are primarily dependent on the level of net product revenues from sales of our cf medicines. our total net product revenues could vary on a quarterly basis based on, among other factors, the timing of orders from our significant customers. additional factors that have caused quarterly fluctuations to our operating results in recent years include variable amounts of revenues, expenses related to business development activities, changes in the fair value of our strategic investments, impairment charges, charges for excess and obsolete inventories, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments and the consolidation or deconsolidation of variable interest entities. our revenues also are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to the global nature of our operations. although we have foreign currency forward contracts to hedge forecasted product revenues denominated in foreign currencies, our efforts to reduce currency exchange losses may not be successful. as a result, currency fluctuations among our reporting currency, the u.s. dollar, and the currencies in which we do business may affect our operating results, often in unpredictable ways. our quarterly results also could be materially affected by significant charges, which may or may not be similar to charges we have experienced in the past. most of our operating expenses relate to our research and development activities, do not vary directly with the amount of revenues and are difficult to adjust in the short term. as a result, if revenues in a particular quarter are below expectations, we are unlikely to reduce operating expenses proportionately for that quarter. these examples are only illustrative and other risks, including those discussed in these "risk factors," could also cause fluctuations in our reported financial results. our operating results during any one period do not necessarily suggest the results of future periods.
we expect that results from our clinical development activities and the clinical development activities of our competitors will continue to be released periodically, and may result in significant volatility in the price of our common stock.
any new information regarding our products and drug candidates or competitive products or potentially competitive drug candidates can substantially affect investors' perceptions regarding our future prospects. we, our collaborators and our competitors periodically provide updates regarding drug development programs, typically through press releases, conference calls and presentations at medical conferences. these periodic updates often include interim or final results from clinical trials conducted by us or our competitors and/or information about our or our competitors' expectations regarding regulatory filings and submissions as well as future clinical development of our products or drug candidates, competitive products or potentially competitive drug candidates. the timing of the release of information by us regarding our drug development programs is often beyond our control and is influenced by the timing of receipt of data from our clinical trials and by the general preference among pharmaceutical companies to disclose clinical data during medical conferences. in addition, the information disclosed about our clinical trials, or our competitors' clinical trials, may be based on interim rather than final data that may involve interpretation difficulties and may in any event not accurately predict final results.
changes in tax laws, regulations and treaties could affect our future taxable income.
a change in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation, of any country in which we operate could materially affect us if we generate taxable income in a future period. on december 22, 2017, the united states enacted h.r.1., known as the tax cuts and jobs act, which represented a substantial change to tax laws in the united states, but which did not have a material impact on our financial statements because we maintained a valuation allowance on the majority of our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2017, which was only released at the end of 2018. however, over the next several years we expect to utilize our net operating losses and other deferred assets, and any future changes in tax laws could have a material effect on our business.
we continue to assess the impact of various tax reform proposals and modifications to existing tax treaties in all jurisdictions where we have operations to determine the potential effect on our business and any assumptions we have made about our future taxable income. we cannot predict whether any specific proposals will be enacted, the terms of any such proposals or what effect, if any, such proposals would have on our business if they were to be enacted.
we may need to raise additional capital that may not be available.
we may need to raise additional capital in the future. any potential public offering, private placement or debt financing may or may not be similar to the transactions that we entered into in the past. any debt financing may be on terms that, among other things, include conversion features that could result in dilution to our then-existing security holders and restrict our ability to pay interest and dividends-although we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. additionally, our pledge of specified assets as collateral to secure our obligations under our credit agreement may limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing. any equity financings would result in dilution to our then-existing security holders. if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be required to curtail significantly or discontinue one or more of our research, drug discovery or development programs, including clinical trials, incur significant cash exit costs, or attempt to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies, drugs or drug candidates. based on many factors, including general economic conditions, additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.
future indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, and the terms of our credit agreement impose restrictions on our business, reducing our operational flexibility and creating default risks.
in october 2016, we entered into a credit agreement providing for a $500 million revolving facility, $300 million of which was drawn at closing and subsequently paid off in february 2017. the credit agreement provides that, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, we may request that the borrowing capacity under the credit agreement be increased by an additional $300.0 million. all outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement mature on october 13, 2021. if we borrow under our current credit agreements or any future credit agreement, such indebtedness could have important consequences to our business, including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse financial, business, economic and industry conditions, as well as other factors that are beyond our control. the credit agreement requires that we comply with certain financial covenants, including (i) a consolidated leverage ratio covenant and (ii) a consolidated ebitda covenant, in each case to be measured on a quarterly basis. further, the credit agreement includes negative covenants, subject to exceptions, restricting or limiting our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, engage in certain investment, acquisition and disposition transactions, pay dividends, repurchase capital stock and enter into transactions with affiliates. as a result, we may be restricted from engaging in business activities that may otherwise improve our business. failure to comply with the covenants could result in an event of default that could trigger acceleration of our indebtedness, which would require us to repay all amounts owing under the credit agreement and/or our capital leases and could have a material adverse effect on our business. additionally, our obligations under the credit agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries. all obligations under the credit agreement, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of all guarantors (excluding intellectual property, owned and leased real property and certain other excluded property), including the pledge of all or a portion of the equity interests of certain of our subsidiaries. if we fail to satisfy our obligations under the credit agreement or are unable to obtain sufficient funds to make payments, the lenders could foreclose on our pledged collateral.
issuances of additional shares of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline.
as of december 31, 2018, we had 255.2 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding. as of december 31, 2018, we also had outstanding options to purchase 8.6 million shares of common stock with a weighted-average exercise price of $111.46 per share. outstanding vested options are likely to be exercised if the market price of our common stock exceeds the applicable exercise price, and, in the future, we expect to issue additional options and restricted stock units to directors and employees. in addition, we may issue additional common stock or restricted securities in the future as part of financing activities or business development activities and any such issuances may have a dilutive effect on our then-existing shareholders. sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the open market, or the availability of such shares for sale, could adversely affect the price of our common stock. the issuance of restricted common stock or common stock upon exercise of any outstanding options would be dilutive, and may cause the market price for a share of our common stock to decline.
our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of up to $500 million to repurchase shares of our common stock. our stock repurchases will depend upon, among other factors, our cash balances and potential future capital requirements, results of operations, financial condition and other factors that we may deem relevant. we can provide no assurance that we will repurchase stock at favorable prices, if at all.
we have adopted anti-takeover provisions and are subject to massachusetts corporate laws that may frustrate any attempt to remove or replace our current management or effectuate a business combination involving vertex.
our corporate charter and by-law provisions and massachusetts state laws may discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change of control of vertex that might be beneficial to us or our security holders. although we amended our charter to eliminate staggered terms for our board of directors, our shareholders will not have the ability to vote for all members of the board of directors on an annual basis until 2020. our by-laws grant the directors a right to adjourn annual meetings of shareholders, and certain provisions of our by-laws may be amended only with an 80% shareholder vote. we may issue shares of any class or series of preferred stock in the future without shareholder approval and upon such terms as our board of directors may determine. the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any class or series of preferred stock that may be issued in the future. massachusetts state law prohibits us from engaging in specified business combinations, unless the combination is approved or consummated in a prescribed manner, and prohibits voting by any shareholder who acquires 20% or more of our voting stock without shareholder approval. as a result, shareholders or other parties may find it more difficult to remove or replace our current management.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we invest in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for people with serious diseases. our business is focused on developing and commercializing therapies for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, or cf, and advancing our research and development programs in other serious diseases. our marketed products are symdeko/symkevi (tezacaftor in combination with ivacaftor), orkambi (lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor) and kalydeco (ivacaftor), which are collectively approved to treat approximately half of the 75,000 cf patients in north america, europe and australia. our triple combination regimens, if approved, would significantly increase the number of cf patients eligible for our products and could provide an improved treatment option for a majority of the patients currently eligible for our products. in november 2018, we reported positive data, including interim data, from the phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the triple combination of vx-659, tezacaftor and ivacaftor in patients with a copy of the f508del mutation in their cftr gene and a second mutation that results in minimal cftr function, whom we refer to as f508del/min patients; and who have two copies of the f508del mutation, whom we refer to as f508del homozygous patients. in the first quarter of 2019, we expect to report data from the phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the triple combination of vx-445, tezacaftor and ivacaftor. we expect that this data in conjunction with the vx-659 data that was reported in november 2018 will enable us to choose the better of the two regimens to submit for regulatory approval. we expect to submit a new drug application, or nda, to the united states food and drug administration, or fda, for a triple combination regimen no later than mid-2019. we also are developing drug candidates for the treatment of pain, beta-thalassemia, sickle cell disease and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.
2018 financial highlights revenues:
in 2018, our cf net product revenues continued to increase due to the approval of our third cf medicine, symdeko/symkevi, and increasing kayldeco net product revenues. in 2019, we expect our cf net product revenues to continue to increase due to full-year revenues from symdeko/symkevi and further cf net product revenue growth will be dependent on if, and when, we are able to able to obtain approval to market a triple combination regimen for patients with cf.
2018 business highlights cystic fibrosis

•   entered into innovative long-term access agreements in ex-u.s markets, including australia and denmark.
•   initiated a phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate vx-121, an additional next-generation cftr corrector.
•   demonstrated proof-of-concept for vx-150, a nav1.8 inhibitor, in acute and neuropathic pain and initiated a phase 2b dosing ranging clinical trial.
•   initiated first clinical trials of ctx001, an investigational gene-editing treatment that we are evaluating as a potential treatment for beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease.
•   initiated a phase 1 clinical trial for a novel drug candidate for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.
•   established a collaboration with arbor biotechnologies to enhance our ongoing efforts to develop innovative gene-editing therapies for a range of serious diseases.
research we plan to continue investing in our research programs and fostering scientific innovation in order to identify and develop transformative medicines. in addition to continuing our research in cf, our current research programs include programs targeting pain, alpha-1 antitrypsin and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. we believe that pursuing research in diverse areas allows us to balance the risks inherent in drug development and may provide drug candidates that will form our pipeline in future years. to supplement our internal research programs, we collaborate with biopharmaceutical and technology companies, leading academic research institutions, government laboratories, foundations and other organizations as needed to advance research in our areas of therapeutic interest and to access technologies needed to execute on our strategy.
drug discovery and development discovery and development of a new pharmaceutical product is a difficult and lengthy process that requires significant financial resources along with extensive technical and regulatory expertise. potential drug candidates are subjected to rigorous evaluations, driven in part by stringent regulatory considerations, designed to generate information concerning efficacy, side-effects, proper dosage levels and a variety of other physical and chemical characteristics that are important in determining whether a drug candidate should be approved for marketing as a pharmaceutical product. most chemical compounds that are investigated as potential drug candidates never progress into development, and most drug candidates that do advance into development never receive marketing approval. because our investments in drug candidates are subject to considerable risks, we closely monitor the results of our discovery, research, clinical trials and nonclinical studies and frequently evaluate our drug development programs in light of new data and scientific, business and commercial insights, with the objective of balancing risk and potential. this process can result in abrupt changes in focus and priorities as new information becomes available and as we gain additional understanding of our ongoing programs and potential new programs, as well as those of our competitors.
if we believe that data from a completed registration program support approval of a drug candidate, we submit an nda to the fda requesting approval to market the drug candidate in the united states and seek analogous approvals from comparable regulatory authorities in jurisdictions outside the united states. to obtain approval, we must, among other things, demonstrate with evidence gathered in nonclinical studies and well-controlled clinical trials that the drug candidate is safe and effective for the disease it is intended to treat and that the manufacturing facilities, processes and controls for the manufacture of the drug candidate are adequate. the fda and ex-u.s. regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in deciding whether or not a drug candidate should be granted approval based on the benefits and risks of the drug candidate in the treatment of a particular disease, and could delay, limit or deny regulatory approval. if regulatory delays are significant or regulatory approval is limited or denied altogether, our financial results and the commercial prospects for the drug candidate involved will be harmed.
regulatory compliance our marketing of pharmaceutical products is subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations. we have a corporate compliance program designed to actively identify, prevent and mitigate risk through the implementation of compliance policies and systems and through the promotion of a culture of compliance. among other laws, regulations and standards, we are subject to various u.s. federal and state laws, and comparable laws in other jurisdictions, pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws, and laws prohibiting the promotion of drugs for unapproved or off-label uses. anti-kickback laws make it illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration to induce the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug that is reimbursed by a state or federal program. false claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly or willfully presenting for payment to third-party payors, including medicare and medicaid, claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. we are subject to laws and regulations that regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as laws such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, which govern our international business practices with respect to payments to government officials. we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to maintain, administer and expand these compliance programs globally.
reimbursement sales of our products depend, to a large degree, on the extent to which our products are reimbursed by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed health care organizations. we dedicate substantial management and other resources in order to obtain and maintain appropriate levels of reimbursement for our products from third-party payors, including governmental organizations in the united states and ex-u.s. markets.
in the united states, we have worked successfully with third party-payors in order to promptly obtain appropriate levels of reimbursement for our cf medicines, and as such, more than 95% of patients across the u.s. have access to our medicines through their insurance plans. we continue to engage in discussions with numerous commercial insurers and managed health care organizations, along with government health programs that are typically managed by authorities in the individual states, to ensure that payors recognize the significant benefits that our medicines provide by treating the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis and continue to provide access to our current medicines.
in europe and other ex-u.s. markets, we seek government reimbursement for our medicines on a country-by-country basis. this is necessary for each new medicine, as well as label expansions for our current medicines in most countries. we successfully obtained reimbursement for kalydeco in each significant ex-u.s. market within two years of approval. we are experiencing significant challenges in obtaining reimbursement for orkambi in certain ex-u.s. markets. specifically, we have been discussing potential reimbursement for orkambi in the united kingdom and france, which represent significant potential markets for our cf medicines, since its approval in 2015. in other ex-u.s. markets, including australia, denmark, germany, ireland, sweden and italy, we have reached pricing and reimbursement agreements for orkambi. in some of these countries, we have innovative reimbursement arrangements that provide a pathway to access and rapid reimbursement for certain future cf medicines, including arrangements in ireland, denmark and australia.
collaboration arrangements and strategic investments in-license agreements we have entered into collaborations with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in order to acquire rights or to license drug candidates or technologies that enhance our pipeline and/or our research capabilities. over the last several years, we entered into collaboration agreements with:
•   crispr therapeutics ag, or crispr, pursuant to which we are collaborating on the discovery and development of potential new treatments aimed at the underlying genetic causes of human diseases using crispr-cas9 gene editing technology;
•   arbor biotechnologies, inc., or arbor, pursuant to which we are collaborating on the discovery of novel proteins, including dna endonucleases, to advance the development of new gene-editing therapies; and
•   moderna therapeutics, inc., or moderna, pursuant to which we are seeking to identify and develop messenger ribonucleic acid, or mrna, therapeutics for the treatment of cf.
generally, when we in-license a technology or drug candidate, we make upfront payments to the collaborator, assume the costs of the program and agree to make contingent payments, which could consist of milestone, royalty and option payments. depending on many factors, including the structure of the collaboration, the significance of the drug candidate that we license to the collaborator's operations and the other activities in which our collaborators are engaged, the accounting for these transactions can vary significantly.
for example, the upfront payments and expenses incurred in connection with our crispr and moderna collaborations are being expensed as research expenses because the collaboration represents a small portion of each of these collaborator's overall business. crispr and moderna's activities unrelated to our collaborations have no effect on our consolidated financial statements. in contrast, parion sciences, inc., or parion, and bioaxone biosciences, inc., or bioaxone, have historically been accounted for as variable interest entities, or vies, and historically have been included in our consolidated financial statements due to (i) the significance of the respective licensed programs to parion and bioaxone as a whole, (ii) our power to control the significant activities of the entities under each collaboration and (iii) our obligation to absorb losses and right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant. in 2017 and 2018, we determined that the above conditions were no longer satisfied with respect to parion and bioaxone, respectively. as a result, we deconsolidated parion and bioaxone from our consolidated financial statements as of september 30, 2017 and december 31, 2018, respectively.
a collaborator that we account for as a vie may engage in activities unrelated to our collaboration. the revenues and expenses unrelated to the programs we in-license from our vies have historically been immaterial to our consolidated financial statements. with respect to each of parion and bioaxone, the activities unrelated to our collaborations with these entities represented approximately 2% or less of our total revenues and total expenses on an annual basis during the periods that we consolidated these collaborators. as a result of these deconsolidations, these amounts decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 and we do not expect to have similar items in 2019 based on our current collaborations. for consolidated vies, we evaluated the fair value of the contingent payments payable by us on a quarterly basis. changes in the fair value of these contingent future payments affected net income attributable to vertex on a dollar-for-dollar basis, with increases in the fair value of contingent payments payable by us to a vie resulting in a decrease in net income attributable to vertex (or an increase in net loss attributable to vertex) and decreases in the fair value of contingent payments payable by us to a vie resulting in an increase in net income attributable to vertex (or decrease in net loss attributable to vertex). for additional information regarding our vies see note b, "collaborative arrangements and acquisitions," and our critical accounting policies "collaborations; intangible assets and variable interest entities."
out-license agreements we also have out-licensed internally-developed programs to collaborators who are leading the development of these programs. these out-license arrangements include our collaboration agreements with:
•   janssen pharmaceuticals, inc., or janssen, which is evaluating pimodivir in phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of influenza; and
•   merck kgaa, darmstadt, germany, which licensed oncology research and development programs from us in early 2017.
pursuant to these out-licensing arrangements, our collaborators are responsible for the research, development and commercialization costs associated with these programs, and we are entitled to receive contingent milestone and/or royalty payments. as a result, we do not expect to incur significant expenses in connection with these programs and have the potential for future collaborative and royalty revenues resulting from these programs.
strategic investments in connection with our business development activities, we have periodically made equity investments in our collaborators. as of december 31, 2018, we held strategic equity investments in crispr, a public company, and moderna, which became a publicly traded company in december 2018, and certain private companies, and we may make additional strategic equity investments in the future. while we invest the majority of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in instruments with low risk that meet specific credit quality standards and limit our exposure to any one issue or type of instrument, our strategic investments are maintained and managed separately from our other cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.
until december 31, 2017, changes in the fair value of these strategic investments were reflected on our consolidated balance sheet, but did not affect our net income until the related gains or losses were realized. as a result of new accounting guidance, effective january 1, 2018, any changes in the fair value of equity investments with readily determinable fair values (including publicly traded securities such as crispr and moderna) are recorded to other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations. for equity investments without readily determinable fair values (including private equity investments), each reporting period we are required to re-evaluate the carrying value of the investment, which may result in other income (expense).
in 2018, we recorded within other income (expense), net an unrealized gain of $2.6 million related to changes in the fair value of our investments in crispr and moderna, which are included in our net income. in 2018, income and expenses related to these investments did not have a material effect on our annual other income (expense), but had material effects on our quarterly other income (expense). to the extent that we continue to hold strategic investments and in particular strategic investments in publicly traded companies, we will record on a quarterly basis other income (expense) related to these strategic investments. due to the high volatility of stocks in the biotechnology industry, we expect the value of these strategic investments to fluctuate and that the increases or decreases in the fair value of these strategic investments will continue to have material impacts on our net income (expense) and our profitability under gaap on a quarterly and/or annual basis.

net income attributable to vertex was $2.10 billion in 2018 as compared to $263.5 million in 2017. in the fourth quarter of 2018, we recorded a one-time non-cash benefit from income taxes of $1.56 billion when we released the valuation allowance on the majority of our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets. this one-time benefit is included in other items, net in the preceding table and substantially increased the net income attributable to vertex in 2018.
our operating costs and expenses increased in 2018 as compared to 2017 due to increased costs of sales related to our increased product revenues and increased expenses related to our ongoing research and development efforts. our operating expenses in each of 2018 and 2017 were affected by expenses related to business development activities. in 2018, we incurred $111.6 million in research expenses primarily related to upfront payments for collaborations and license agreements that we entered into during 2018. in 2017, we incurred a $255.3 million impairment charge related to parion's pulmonary enac platform and $160.0 million in development expenses incurred in connection with our acquisition of vx-561 from concert pharmaceuticals, inc., or concert, each of which is included in operating costs and expenses in the preceding table.
net income attributable to vertex was $263.5 million in 2017 as compared to a net loss attributable to vertex of $(112.1) million in 2016. our revenues increased in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to increased orkambi and kalydeco net product revenues and $230.0 million in one-time collaborative revenues related to the strategic collaboration and license agreement we established with merck kgaa, darmstadt, germany, in 2017. our operating costs and expenses increased in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to increases in our cost of sales related to our increased net product revenues, increases in our research and development expenses, which included $160.0 million in development expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition of vx-561 from concert, increases in our sales and administrative expenses and a $255.3 million intangible asset impairment charge related to parion's pulmonary enac platform. other items, net in 2017 primarily reflect a benefit from income taxes and certain other benefits associated with the impairment of parion's pulmonary enac platform, for which there were no comparable benefits in 2016, and a decrease in interest expense, net to $57.6 million. other items, net in 2016 primary reflects interest expense, net of $81.4 million, a provision for income taxes of $16.7 million and net income attributable to noncontrolling interest of $28.0 million.
earnings per share in 2018, 2017 and 2016, net income (loss) attributable to vertex was $8.09, $1.04, $(0.46), respectively, per diluted share. the increase in our diluted earnings per share in 2018 compared to 2017 was due to, among other things, the increased net product revenues and the benefit from income taxes as a result of the release of our valuation allowance on the majority of our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets. the release of the valuation allowance increased net income attributable to vertex by $6.03 per diluted share.
in 2018, 2017 and 2016, the number of diluted shares used to calculate net income (loss) per common share was 259.2 million, 253.2 million and 244.7 million, respectively. the increase in diluted shares in each year was primarily due to our issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to our employee equity programs.
in 2018, our total cf net product revenues increased by $872.8 million as compared to 2017. the increase in total cf net product revenues was due to the increasing number of patients being treated as a result of the approval of symdeko in the u.s., label expansions for kalydeco and orkambi and expanded access in ex-u.s. markets. we believe that our total cf net product revenues will increase in 2019 due primarily to increases in symdeko/symkevi net product revenues and further cf net product revenue growth will be dependent on when, and if, we obtain approval for our triple combination regimens. our net product revenues are also dependent on, if, and when, we obtain additional reimbursement agreements for our cf medicines in ex-u.s. markets, particularly in the united kingdom and france.
symdeko/symkevi symdeko/symkevi net product revenues were $768.7 million in 2018. symdeko was approved by the fda in february 2018 and symkevi was approved in the european union in november 2018. in 2018, symdeko net product revenues increased each quarter as new patients initiated treatment. we did not recognize significant net product revenues from sales of symkevi during 2018. we expect symdeko/symkevi net product revenues to continue to increase in 2019 as compared to 2018 due to the full year impact of symdeko sales in the united states and as patients begin to obtain access to symkevi in ex-u.s. markets.
orkambi the approval of symdeko/symkevi has had a negative effect on the net product revenues from orkambi as a portion of the patients who were being treated with orkambi switched to symdeko/symkevi. due primarily to patients switching from orkambi to symdeko in the united states, orkambi net product revenues decreased by 4.4% in 2018 as compared to 2017. in 2018, orkambi net product revenues were $1.26 billion, including $310.5 million of net product revenues from ex-u.s. markets, compared to orkambi net product revenues of $1.32 billion in 2017, including $167.6 million of net product revenues from ex-u.s. markets. in 2016, orkambi net product revenues were $979.6 million, including $76.4 million of net product revenues from ex-u.s. markets.
our consolidated balance sheet includes $354.4 million collected as of december 31, 2018 in france related to orkambi supplied under early access programs at the invoiced price. pursuant to the revenue recognition guidance that became effective under gaap on january 1, 2018, we have recognized limited net product revenues to date on sales of orkambi in france due to ongoing pricing discussions regarding the reimbursement rate for orkambi. please refer to "critical accounting policies - revenue recognition" below for a discussion of our accounting treatment for our early access program for orkambi in france.
kalydeco in 2018, kalydeco net product revenues were $1.01 billion, including $363.5 million of net product revenues from ex-u.s. markets, compared to kalydeco net product revenues of $844.6 million in 2017, including $334.2 million of net product revenues from ex-u.s. markets. in 2016, kalydeco net product revenues were $703.4 million, including $303.9 million of net product revenues from ex-u.s. markets. the increases year-over-year were primarily due to additional patients being treated with kalydeco as we completed reimbursement discussions in various ex-u.s. jurisdictions and as we increased the number of patients eligible to receive kalydeco through label expansions.
collaborative and royalty revenues our collaborative and royalty revenues were $9.3 million, $323.2 million and $18.5 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. in 2017, our collaborative and royalty revenues primarily included (i) $230.0 million in revenues related to the one-time upfront payment earned in 2017 from merck kgaa, darmstadt, germany, and (ii) a $25.0 million milestone related to our license agreement with janssen, inc. for the treatment of influenza. our 2017 collaborative and royalty revenues also included $40.0 million in revenues related to upfront and milestone payments earned by parion in 2017 pursuant to a license agreement parion entered into with a third party. we are not a party to the parion license agreement and have no economic interest in either the license or these milestone payments. these revenues were included in our consolidated financial statements because we were consolidating parion as a vie during the first three quarters of 2017. parion was deconsolidated as a vie as of september 30, 2017 and any future payments received by parion pursuant to this license agreement will no longer be recognized by us as collaborative revenue. in 2016 through 2018, our collaborative and royalty revenues also include a small amount of revenues related to a cash payment we received in 2008 when we sold our rights to certain hiv royalties and reimbursements for research and development activities and milestones related to our collaborative arrangements.

** not meaningful cost of sales our cost of sales primarily consists of the cost of producing inventories that corresponded to product revenues for the reporting period, plus the third-party royalties payable on our net sales of our products. pursuant to our agreement with the cff, our tiered third-party royalties on sales of symdeko/symkevi, kalydeco and orkambi, calculated as a percentage of net sales, range from the single digits to the sub-teens. as a result of the tiered royalty rate, which resets annually, our cost of sales as a percentage of cf net product revenues are lower at the beginning of each calendar year.
over the last several years, our cost of sales has been increasing primarily due to increased net product revenues. our costs of sales as a percentage of cf net product revenues increased from 12.7% in 2017 to 13.5% in 2018 due to the tiered royalties that we pay to the cff. in 2019, we expect our total cost of sales will increase due to expected increases in our cf net product revenues and that our cost of sales as a percentage of total cf net product revenues will be similar to our cost of sales as a percentage of total cf net product revenues in 2018.

our research and development expenses include internal and external costs incurred for research and development of our drugs and drug candidates and expenses related to certain technology that we acquire or license through business development transactions. we do not assign our internal costs, such as salary and benefits, stock-based compensation expense, laboratory supplies and other direct expenses and infrastructure costs, to individual drugs or drug candidates, because the employees within our research and development groups typically are deployed across multiple research and development programs. these internal costs are greater than our external costs, such as the costs of services provided to us by clinical research organizations and other outsourced research, which we allocate by individual program. all research and development costs for our drugs and drug candidates are expensed as incurred.
over the past three years, we have incurred $3.8 billion in research and development expenses associated with drug discovery and development. the successful development of our drug candidates is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risks. in addition, the duration of clinical trials may vary substantially according to the type, complexity and novelty of the drug candidate and the disease indication being targeted. the fda and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial requirements on the introduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products, typically requiring lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures, sampling activities and other costly and time-consuming procedures. data obtained from nonclinical and clinical activities at any step in the testing process may be adverse and lead to discontinuation or redirection of development activities. data obtained from these activities also are susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. the duration and cost of discovery, nonclinical studies and clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project and are difficult to predict. therefore, accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate costs to bring our drug candidates to market are not available.
in 2016, 2017 and 2018, costs related to our cf programs represented the largest portion of our development costs. any estimates regarding development and regulatory timelines for our drug candidates are highly subjective and subject to change. in the fourth quarter of 2018, we obtained positive data from two phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the triple combination of vx-659, tezacaftor and ivacaftor and we plan to submit an nda to the fda for a triple combination regimen with vx-659 or vx-445 no later than mid-2019. we cannot make a meaningful estimate when, if ever, our other clinical development programs will generate revenues and cash flows.

** not meaningful our development expenses decreased by $35.3 million, or 3%, in 2018 as compared to 2017 and increased by $280.3 million, or 38%, in 2017 as compared to 2016. the decrease in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to the $160.0 million payment to concert in connection with the acquisition of vx-561 in 2017 for which there were no comparable expenses in 2018, partially offset by increased costs associated with ongoing clinical trials, including phase 3 clinical trials evaluating our next-generation cftr corrector compounds as part of triple combination treatment regimens.
sales, general and administrative expenses increased by 12% in 2018 as compared to 2017, and by 15% in 2017 as compared to 2016. these increases were primarily due to increased global support for our products. we expect our sales, general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in 2019.
restructuring expenses in 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded restructuring (income) expenses of $(0.2) million, $14.2 million and $1.3 million, respectively. our restructuring expenses in 2017 were primarily related to our decision to consolidate our research activities into our boston, milton park and san diego locations and to close our research site in canada.
intangible asset impairment charge in 2018, we recorded a $29.0 million impairment charge attributable to non-controlling interest related to vx-210 that was licensed from bioaxone in 2014. in 2017, we recorded a $255.3 million impairment charge related to parion's pulmonary enac platform that we licensed from parion in 2015 and a benefit from income taxes of $97.7 million related to this impairment charge attributable to non-controlling interest. there were no corresponding intangible asset impairment charges in 2016.
other items, net interest expense, net our interest expense, net relates primarily to interest expenses associated with certain of our real estate leases and outstanding debt, if any, partially offset by interest income from the investment of our cash equivalents and marketable securities. in 2018, 2017 and 2016, interest expense, net was $34.1 million, $57.6 million and $81.4 million, respectively. the decrease in interest expense, net in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to an increase in our interest income resulting from an increase in our cash equivalents and marketable securities. the decrease in interest expense, net in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to the repayment of the $300.0 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility in february 2017. in 2019, we expect that we will incur approximately $52 million in interest expenses related to our real estate leases, including a decrease in 2019 as compared to 2018 of approximately $13 million based on updated accounting guidance related to aspects of lease accounting that became effective january 1, 2019. in addition to the updated accounting guidance, our future net interest expense will also be dependent on whether, and to what extent, we reborrow amounts under our credit facility and the amount of and prevailing market interest rates on our outstanding cash equivalents and marketable securities.
other income (expense), net in 2018, we recorded net other expense of $0.8 million. in 2017, we recorded net other expense of $81.4 million primarily related to the deconsolidation of parion. in 2016, we recorded net other income of $4.1 million primarily related to foreign exchange gains.
in 2018, our other income (expense), net fluctuated significantly on a quarterly basis based on the fair value of our strategic investments. while the annual effect on our other income (expense), net from our investments in crispr and moderna was a gain of $2.6 million, the value of these investments increased by $149.4 million in the first half of 2018 and decreased by $146.8 million in the second half of 2018. we expect that due to the volatility of the stock price of biotechnology companies our other income (expense), net will fluctuate based on increases or decreases in the fair value of our strategic investments including crispr and moderna.
income taxes in 2018, we recorded a benefit from income taxes of $1.49 billion. in 2017 and 2018, we were profitable from a u.s. federal income tax perspective and have used a portion of our net operating losses to offset this income since becoming profitable. until the fourth quarter of 2018, we maintained a valuation allowance on the majority of our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets. due to this valuation allowance, we did not record a significant provision for income taxes in 2016, 2017 and the nine months ended september 30, 2018. in the fourth quarter of 2018, we released the valuation allowance resulting in a non-cash credit to net income of $1.56 billion. further information on the release of the valuation allowance and significant judgments related to its release can be found below in "critical accounting policies - income taxes."
in 2019, we expect to continue to utilize our net operating losses to offset income, but would begin recording a significant provision for income taxes reflecting the utilization of the deferred tax assets. the majority of this provision for income taxes will be a non-cash expense until our net operating losses are fully utilized.
in 2017, we recorded a benefit from income taxes of $107.3 million, primarily due to a total benefit from income taxes of $114.1 million attributable to noncontrolling interest related to the impairment of parion's pulmonary enac platform and decrease in the fair value of the contingent payments payable by us to parion. in 2016, we recorded a provision for income taxes of $16.7 million, principally due to income taxes payable by our vies.
noncontrolling interest (vies)
the net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interest (vies) recorded on our consolidated statements of operations reflects parion (through september 30, 2017) and bioaxone's net (income) loss for the reporting period, adjusted for any changes in the noncontrolling interest holders' claim to net assets, including contingent milestone, royalty and option payments. a summary of net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interest related to our vies for the three years ended december 31, 2018 is as follows:

net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interest                                                                                           $9,793              $171,849              $(28,021   )
in 2018, the net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest was primarily related to the $29.0 million impairment charge related to vx-210 offset by an increase in the fair value of the contingent payments payable by us to bioaxone of $17.7 million primarily due to the expiration of our option to purchase bioaxone in 2018. in 2017, the net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest was primarily related to the $255.3 million impairment charge related to parion's pulmonary enac platform, a decrease in fair value of the contingent payments payable by us to parion of $69.6 million upon deconsolidation and benefit from income taxes of $126.2 million related to these charges. in 2016, the net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was primarily related to an increase in the fair value of contingent payments based on a phase 2 clinical trial of vx-371 achieving its primary safety endpoint.
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes the components of our financial condition as of december 31, 2018 and 2017:
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities      $3,168,242                $2,088,666                $1,079,576                52     %
working capital total current assets                                  $3,843,109                $2,648,963                $1,194,146                45     %
total current liabilities                             (1,120,292    )             (807,260    )             (313,032     )          39     %
total working capital                                 $2,722,817                $1,841,703                  $881,114                48     %
as of december 31, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $3.2 billion, which represented an increase of $1.1 billion from $2.1 billion as of december 31, 2017. in 2018, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance increased primarily due to cash receipts from product sales and $289.3 million of cash received from issuances of common stock under our employee benefit plans partially offset by cash expenditures to fund our operations and $350.0 million of cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock. we expect that our future cash flows will be substantially dependent on our cf product sales.
as of december 31, 2018, total working capital was $2.7 billion, which represented an increase of $881.1 million from $1.8 billion as of december 31, 2017. the most significant items that increased total working capital in 2018 were $1.3 billion of cash provided by operations and $289.3 million of cash received from issuances of common stock under our employee benefit plans partially offset by $350.0 million of cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock and expenditures for property and equipment of $95.5 million as well as other expenditures.
sources of liquidity we intend to rely on our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities together with cash flows from product sales as our primary source of liquidity. we are receiving cash flows from sales of kalydeco and orkambi in the united states and ex-u.s. markets and from symdeko in the united states. we will begin receiving cash flows from sales of symkevi in the european union in 2019. future net product revenues from ex-u.s. markets will be dependent on, among other things, the timing of and our ability to complete reimbursement discussions in european countries.
we may borrow up to $500.0 million pursuant to a revolving credit facility that we entered into in 2016. we may repay and reborrow amounts under the revolving credit agreement without penalty. subject to certain conditions, we may request that the borrowing capacity under this credit agreement be increased by an additional $300.0 million.
in 2018 and 2017, we received significant proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee benefit plans and more limited proceeds from employee benefit plans in 2016. the amount and timing of future proceeds from employee benefits plans is uncertain. in 2018, the value of our strategic investment in crispr fluctuated on a quarterly basis. the future value of our strategic investments, including our investments in crispr and moderna, is uncertain. other possible sources of future liquidity include strategic collaborative agreements that include research and/or development funding, commercial debt, public and private offerings of our equity and debt securities, development milestones and royalties on sales of products, software and equipment leases, strategic sales of assets or businesses and financial transactions. negative covenants in our credit agreement may prohibit or limit our ability to access these sources of liquidity.
future capital requirements we have significant future capital requirements including:
•   incurring substantial operating expenses to conduct research and development activities and to operate our organization; and
•   having substantial facility and capital lease obligations, including leases for two buildings in boston, massachusetts that continue through 2028 and a lease in san diego, california that continues through 2034.
in addition,
•   as of december 31, 2018, we have accrued approximately $354.4 million from orkambi early access programs in france. we expect we will be required to repay a portion of the collected amounts to the french government based on the difference between the invoiced price of orkambi and the final price for orkambi in france once we conclude our ongoing pricing discussions with the french government.
•   we have entered into certain collaboration agreements with third parties that include the funding of certain research, development and commercialization efforts with the potential for future milestone and royalty payments by us upon the achievement of pre-established developmental and regulatory targets and/or commercial targets, and we may enter into additional business development transactions, including acquisitions, collaborations and equity investments, that require additional capital. for example, in 2018 and 2017, we made $100.4 million and $168.7 million of upfront and milestone payments related to collaborations and asset acquisitions.
•   to the extent we borrow amounts under the credit agreement we entered into in october 2016, we would be required to repay any outstanding principal amounts in 2021.
we expect that cash flows from our cf products together with our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. the adequacy of our available funds to meet our future operating and capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the amounts of future revenues generated by cf products, and the potential introduction of one or more of our other drug candidates to the market, including a triple combination regimen for patients with cf, the level of our business development activities and the number, breadth, cost and prospects of our research and development programs.
financing strategy we may raise additional capital by borrowing under credit agreements, through public offerings or private placements of our securities or securing new collaborative agreements or other methods of financing. we will continue to manage our capital structure and will consider all financing opportunities, whenever they may occur, that could strengthen our long-term liquidity profile. there can be no assurance that any such financing opportunities will be available on acceptable terms, if at all.
contractual commitments and obligations the following table sets forth our commitments and obligations as of december 31, 2018:
facility leases, excluding fan pier leases           18,531                45,053                  42,654                 185,336                    291,574
capital lease obligations                            10,770                12,931                   5,274                   3,085                     32,060
research, development and drug supply costs          20,579                 3,316         314                                   -                     24,209
total contractual commitments and obligations      $121,983              $209,473                $193,526                $583,895                 $1,108,877
leases we lease two buildings that are located at fan pier in boston, massachusetts. we commenced lease payments on these two buildings in december 2013 and the initial lease periods end in december 2028. we also lease office and laboratory space in san diego, california and will commence base rent payments for this building in the second quarter of 2019 pursuant to a 16 year lease. the future minimum rental payments that we are obligated to pay related to the san diego building are included in "facility leases, excluding fan pier leases." the table also reflects leases of equipment that are accounted for as capital leases.
research, development and drug supply costs the amounts reflected in "research, development and drug supply costs," do not include certain payments we anticipate making to clinical research organizations, or cros, because these contracts are cancelable, at our option, with notice. however, we historically have not cancelled such contracts. as of december 31, 2018, we had accrued $53.1 million related to these contracts for costs incurred for services provided through december 31, 2018, and we have approximately $177.0 million in cancelable future commitments based on existing contracts as of december 31, 2018. these amounts reflect planned expenditures based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to, or terminations of, existing contracts or anticipated or potential new contracts.
collaborative arrangements and asset acquisitions we have entered into certain research and development collaboration agreements with third parties and acquired certain assets that include the funding of certain development, manufacturing and commercialization efforts with the potential for future milestone and royalty payments by us upon the achievement of pre-established developmental, regulatory and/or commercial targets. our obligation to fund these efforts is contingent upon continued involvement in the programs and/or the lack of any adverse events that could cause the discontinuance of the programs. these payments include:
•   cff: cff has the right to tiered royalties ranging from single digits to sub-teens on any approved drugs first synthesized and/or tested during a research term on or before february 28, 2014, including kalydeco, orkambi, symdeko/symkevi, lumacaftor, ivacaftor and tezacaftor and royalties ranging from low single digits to mid-single digits on potential sales of certain compounds first synthesized and/or tested between march 1, 2014 and august 31, 2016, including vx-659 and vx-445. for combination products, such as orkambi and symdeko/symkevi, sales are allocated equally to each of the active pharmaceutical ingredients in the combination product.
•   research and development milestones: our collaborations and certain other business development arrangements, including our asset acquisition from concert, have milestone and royalty payments payable by us upon the successful achievement of pre-established developmental, regulatory and/or commercial targets or net sales.
tax-related obligations we exclude liabilities pertaining to uncertain tax positions from our summary of contractual obligations as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. as of december 31, 2018, our liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions were $19.5 million.
other funding commitments our table detailing contractual commitments and obligations does not include severance payment obligations to certain of our executive officers in the event of a not-for-cause employment termination under existing employment contracts. we will provide information regarding these obligations annually in our proxy statement for our annual meeting of shareholders.
in addition, as discussed below, we began distributing orkambi through early access programs in france in 2015 at the invoiced price and are engaged in ongoing pricing discussions regarding the final price for orkambi in france. we expect the difference between the amounts collected at the invoiced price and the final price for orkambi in france will be returned to the french government and that this amount could be material.
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. these items are monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which the change occurs. we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate.
we believe that our application of the following accounting policies, each of which requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management, are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results:
•   revenue recognition;
•   research and development accruals;
•   collaborations; intangible assets and variable interest entities.
our accounting policies, including the ones discussed below, are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, including note a, "nature of business and accounting policies," included in this annual report on form 10-k.
revenue recognition product revenues, net we generate product revenues from sales in the united states and in international markets. we sell our products principally to a limited number of specialty pharmacy and specialty distributors in the united states, which account for the largest portion of our total revenues, and make international sales primarily to specialty distributors and retail chains, as well as hospitals and clinics, many of which are government-owned or supported customers, collectively, our customers. our customers in the united states subsequently resell our products to patients and health care providers. we contract with government agencies so that our products will be eligible for purchase by, or partial or full reimbursement from, such third-party payors. we recognize net product revenues from sales of our products when our customers obtain control of our products, which typically occurs upon delivery to our customers. revenues from our product sales are recorded at the net sales price, or "transaction price," which requires us to make several significant estimates regarding the net sales price.
the most significant estimate we are required to make is related to government and private payor rebates, chargebacks, discounts and fees, collectively rebates. the value of the rebates provided to third-party payors per course of treatment vary significantly and are based on government-mandated discounts and our arrangements with other third-party payors. in order to estimate our total rebates, we estimate the percentage of prescriptions that will be covered by each third-party payor, which is referred to as the payor mix. we track available information regarding changes, if any, to the payor mix for our products, to our contractual terms with third-party payors and to applicable governmental programs and regulations and levels of our products in the distribution channel. we adjust our estimated rebates based on new information, including information regarding actual rebates for our products, as it becomes available. claims by third-party payors for rebates are submitted to us significantly after the related sales, potentially resulting in adjustments in the period in which the new information becomes known. our credits to revenue related to prior period sales have not been significant (typically less than 1% of gross product revenues) and primarily related to u.s. rebates.
the following table summarizes activity related to our accruals for rebates for the three years ended december 31, 2018:
provision related to current period sales       134,198
credits/payments made                           (97,094      )
provision related to current period sales       176,996
credits/payments made                          (137,765      )
provision related to current period sales       330,883
credits/payments made                          (229,361      )
we have also entered into contracts with government-owned and supported customers in international markets that limit the amount of annual reimbursement we can receive. upon exceeding the annual reimbursement amount, products are provided free of charge. we defer a portion of the consideration received, which include upfront payment and fees, for shipments made up to the annual reimbursement limit and the deferred amount is recognized as revenue when the free products are shipped. in order to estimate the portion of the consideration received to recognize as revenue and the portion of the amount to defer, we rely on our forecast of the number of units we will distribute during the applicable annual period in each international market in which our contracts with government-owned and supported customers limit the amount of annual reimbursement we can receive. our forecasts are based on, among other things, our historical experience.
the preceding estimates and judgments materially affect our recognition of net product revenues. changes in our estimates of net product revenues could have a material affect on net product revenues recorded in the period in which we determine that change occurs.
french early access programs we began distributing orkambi through early access programs in france in 2015 and are engaged in ongoing pricing discussions regarding the final price for orkambi in france. our consolidated balance sheets included $354.4 million and $232.4 million collected as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, in france related to orkambi that are classified as "early access sales accrual" related to amounts collected in france as payment for shipments of orkambi under the early access programs at the invoiced price. we expect the difference between the amounts collected at the invoiced price and the final price for orkambi in france will be returned to the french government.
we did not recognize orkambi net product revenues from sales in france under the accounting guidance that was applicable until december 31, 2017. pursuant to asc 606, which we adopted on january 1, 2018, we recorded an $8.3 million cumulative effect adjustment to "accumulated deficit" primarily related to orkambi net product revenues from sales in france and we began recognizing orkambi net product revenues based on our estimate of consideration we expect to retain that will not be subject to a significant reversal, which results in recognized revenue that represents a small percentage of the invoiced price. if our estimates regarding the amounts we will receive pursuant to these programs change, we will reflect the effect of the change in estimate in net product revenues in the period in which the change in estimate occurs and will include adjustments to all prior sales of orkambi under the early access programs. depending on the final price of orkambi and because the current estimate is based on the amount that will not be subject to a significant reversal in amounts recognized, this adjustment could be material.
collaborative and royalty revenues we recognize collaborative and royalty revenues generated through collaborative research, development and/or commercialization agreements. the terms of these agreements typically include payment to us of one or more of the following: nonrefundable, upfront license fees; development and commercial milestone payments; funding of research and/or development activities; and royalties on net sales of licensed products.
in connection, with upfront license fees and milestone payments we receive from these agreements we are required to determine the amount and timing of revenue recognition. these payments can either be recognized immediately or as we complete the performance obligations that we identify as required by the applicable accounting standard. in order to make this determination, we identify all material performance obligations, which may include a license to intellectual property and know-how, research and development activities and/or transition activities. in order to determine the transaction price, in addition to any upfront payment, we estimate the amount of variable consideration at the outset of the contract utilizing either the expected value method or most likely amount method, depending on the facts and circumstances relative to the contract. we constrain (reduce) the estimate of variable consideration such that it is probable that a significant reversal of previously recognized revenue will not occur throughout the life of the contract. when determining if variable consideration should be constrained, we consider whether there are factors outside our control that could result in a significant reversal of revenue. in making these assessments, we consider the likelihood and magnitude of a potential reversal of revenue.
once the estimated transaction price is established, amounts are allocated to the performance obligations that have been identified. the transaction price is generally allocated to each separate performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. in order to account for these agreements, we must develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the standalone selling price, which may include (i) the probability of obtaining marketing approval for the drug candidate, (ii) estimates regarding the timing of and the expected costs to develop and commercialize the drug candidate, (iii) estimates of future cash flows from potential product sales with respect to the drug candidate and (iv) appropriate discount and tax rates.
income taxes we were engaged in research and development activities and incurred significant net operating losses for a number of years before recently becoming profitable. since we started generating profits, we have used a portion of our net operating losses and maintained a valuation allowance on the majority of our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets until december 31, 2018. accordingly, we have not reported any tax benefits relating to our net operating loss carryforwards and income tax credit carryforwards that are available for utilization in future periods. as of december 31, 2018, we released the valuation allowance on the majority of our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets resulting in a non-cash benefit from income taxes of $1.56 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018.
we provide a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. on a periodic basis, we reassess our valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets, weighing positive and negative evidence to assess the recoverability of the deferred tax assets. in the fourth quarter of 2018, we reassessed our valuation allowances and considered positive evidence including significant cumulative consolidated and u.s. income over the three years ended december 31, 2018, revenue growth, clinical program progression, including the advancement and clinical trial data from our triple combination regimens, and expectations regarding future profitability, and negative evidence, including potential impact of competition on our projections and cumulative losses in on the jurisdictions. after assessing both the positive evidence and the negative evidence, we released the valuation allowance on the majority of our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2018.
significant judgment is required in making these assessments to maintain or reverse our valuation allowances and, to the extent our future expectations change we would have to assess the recoverability of these deferred tax assets at that time. the determination to release the majority of our valuation allowances increased our net income by $1.56 billion, or $6.03 per share in 2018. in 2019, due to our release of the majority of our valuation allowance in 2018, we expect to continue to utilize our net operating losses to offset income, but expect to begin recording a significant provision for income taxes reflecting the utilization of our deferred tax assets.
we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. if our estimate of the tax effect of reversing temporary differences is (i) not reflective of actual outcomes, (ii) modified to reflect new developments or interpretations of the tax law, or (iii) revised to incorporate new accounting principles, or changes in the expected timing or manner of the reversal, our results of operations could be materially impacted.
research and development accruals research and development expenses, including amounts funded through research and development collaborations, are expensed as incurred. when third-party service providers' billing terms do not coincide with our period-end, we are required to make estimates of our obligations to those third parties, including clinical trial and pharmaceutical development costs, contractual services costs, costs for drug supply, marketing expenses and infrastructure expenses incurred in a given accounting period and record accruals at the end of the period. we base our estimates on our knowledge of the research and development programs, services performed for the period, experience with related activities and the expected duration of the third-party service contract, where applicable. due to the scope of the research and development activities being conducted and the complexity of our clinical expense models, the estimates and judgments that we make affect the timing of our research and development expense for a reporting period and the related accruals on our consolidated balance sheet. these estimates are not likely to significantly affect the total expense we record over the course of a clinical trial or other research and development activity.
leases our leases, and in particular the leases for our primary facilities, require significant judgment in order to determine the levels of operating expenses and interest expenses we record to our consolidated statement of operations and the amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheet associated with the leases:
•   until december 31, 2018, we were required to determine whether we would be deemed for accounting purposes to be the owner of these buildings as they were constructed. upon completion of these buildings, we were required to determine whether or not the underlying leases met the criteria for "sale-leaseback" treatment.
•   beginning on january 1, 2019, in accordance with asc 842, leases ("asc 842"), we will be required to determine whether the leases associated with these buildings will be reflected as financing leases or operating leases.
as of december 31, 2018, because our corporate headquarters and san diego building did not qualify for sale-leaseback treatment when construction was completed, we recorded the cost of construction of these buildings as "property and equipment, net" and the related lease obligations as "construction financing lease obligation," on our consolidated balance sheets. accordingly, we depreciated the assets and incurred interest expense associated with the financing obligation for these buildings. we bifurcated our lease payments pursuant to the leases into (i) a portion that is allocated to the buildings and (ii) a portion that is allocated to the land on which the buildings were constructed. in 2018, we incurred approximately (1) $15 million in depreciation expense and $7 million in rent expense, each of which is included in our operating expenses and (2) $65 million in interest expenses, related to these leases. the amounts reflected on our consolidated balance sheet and expenses incurred on our consolidated statement of operations required estimates regarding the useful life of the building and appropriate discount rates.
beginning on january 1, 2019, we are accounting for our primary facilities under asc 842. asc 842 continues to require us to use significant judgment to determine whether these buildings should be accounted for as financing or operating leases including the fair value of the buildings at the inception of the lease and appropriate discount rates. whether the buildings are recorded as financing or operating leases will result in significant shifts in the classification of expenses between operating expenses and interest expense on our consolidated statement of operations. this determination will also impact the amount and classification of assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.
under asc 842, we will account for our corporate headquarters and san diego buildings as financing leases requiring us to account for these buildings over their respective lease terms, which are significantly shorter than these buildings' useful lives. under previous guidance, we utilized an estimated useful life of 40 years for these buildings consistent with a useful life an owner would apply to its buildings. as a result, we depreciated the buildings over 40 years, which also impacted the amount of interest expense that we recorded on an annual basis. as a result, in 2019, we expect we will record the following related to our corporate headquarters and san diego leases: (i) operating expenses of approximately $48 million (an increase of approximately $26 million compared to 2018) and (ii) interest expense of approximately $52 million (a decrease of approximately $13 million compared to 2018).
collaborations; intangible assets and variable interest entities our collaborations require us to apply accounting policies that involve significant judgments and that have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. for example, in 2017, we deconsolidated parion, a vie that we had consolidated since 2015, and recorded an intangible asset impairment charge of $255.3 million related to parion's pulmonary enac platform.
we review each collaboration agreement pursuant to which we license assets owned by a collaborator in order to determine whether we have a variable interest via the license agreement with the collaborator and if the variable interest is a variable interest in the collaborator as a whole. in connection with this assessment, we consider and make judgments regarding the following, among other factors: (1) whether the collaborator is a business; (2) the purpose and design of the collaborator; (3) the value of the licensed asset(s) as compared to the value of the collaborator as a whole; and (4) which party has the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the collaborator's economic performance.
we evaluate on a quarterly basis if we continue to have a variable interest in each vie and are the primary beneficiary of the vie, and if we later determine that we no longer have a variable interest or are no longer the primary beneficiary, we deconsolidate the applicable vie. this evaluation involves an assessment of the activities being conducted pursuant to our collaboration agreement with the collaborator, the collaborator's financial statements, discussions with the collaborator's management regarding its other activities, including any new collaborations, financing activities, clinical data and the collaborator's other programs.
we believe that the following effects of the consolidation and deconsolidation of vies on our consolidated financial statements are the most significant:
•   in periods in which we consolidate a vie, we record net income (loss) attributable to our vies' noncontrolling interest. this net income (loss) reflects our vies' net income (loss) for the period as adjusted for gains and losses in the fair value of the contingent payments, which consist of milestone, royalty and option payments, payable by us to our vies. the changes in the fair value of contingent payments decrease or increase our net loss attributable to vertex on a dollar-for-dollar basis.
•   we recorded $255.3 million and $29.0 million, respectively, of intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet based on our estimate of the fair value of parion's and bioaxone's indefinite-lived in-process research and development assets as of the applicable transaction date. we maintain these assets on our consolidated balance sheet until either the research and development project underlying it is completed or the asset becomes impaired. when we determine that an asset has become impaired or we abandon a project, we write down the carrying value of the related intangible asset to its fair value and record an impairment charge in the period in which the impairment occurs. we assess the fair value of these assets using a variety of methods, including present-value models that are based on multiple probability-weighted scenarios involving the development and potential commercialization of the underlying drug candidates. in 2017 and 2018, we recorded full impairment changes for the indefinite-lived in-process research and development assets that were related to our collaborations with parion and bioaxone, respectively. as a result, we did not have any indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2018.
•   in order to account for the fair value of the intangible assets and contingent payments related to collaborations with our vies, we use present-value models based on assumptions regarding the probability of achieving the relevant milestones, estimates regarding the timing of achieving the milestones, estimates of future product sales and the appropriate discount rates. significant judgment is used in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions during each reporting period. changes in these assumptions could have a material effect on the fair value of the contingent payments and affect the analysis of whether or not an intangible asset is impaired.
•   the revenues, research and development expenses and sales, general and administrative expenses of our vies that are unrelated to the programs that we in-license from our vies and that are consolidated into our financial statements are set forth in the table below and represent approximately 2% or less of our revenues, research and development expenses and sales, general and administrative expenses in each period:
research and development expenses                                                                                                                     (2,114   )            (7,729   )            (6,762   )

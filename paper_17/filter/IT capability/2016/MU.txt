item 1a. risk factors in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this form 10-k, the following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from past results and those contained in any forward-looking statements made by us.  the order of these factors is not necessarily indicative of the level of risk that each poses to us.  our operations could also be affected by other factors that are presently unknown to us or not considered significant.  the factors below could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and stock price.
we have experienced dramatic declines in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products which have adversely affected our business.
if average selling prices for our memory products decrease faster than we can decrease per gigabit costs, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. we have experienced significant decreases in our average selling prices per gigabit in previous years as noted in the table below and may continue to experience such decreases in the future. in some prior periods, average selling prices for our memory products have been below our manufacturing costs and we may experience such circumstances in the future.
(percentage change in average selling prices)
our gross margins are dependent upon continuing decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes and product designs, including, but not limited to, process line-width, additional 3d memory layers, additional bits per cell (i.e., cell levels), architecture, number of mask layers, number of fabrication steps, and yield. in future periods, we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to maintain or improve gross margins. factors that may limit our ability to reduce costs include, but are not limited to, strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix, the increasing complexity of manufacturing processes, difficulties in transitioning to smaller line-width process technologies, technological barriers, and changes in process technologies or products that may require relatively larger die sizes. per gigabit manufacturing costs may also be affected by the relatively smaller production quantities and shorter product lifecycles of certain specialty memory products.
the semiconductor memory industry is highly competitive.
we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies, including intel; samsung electronics co., ltd.; sk hynix inc.; toshiba corporation; and western digital corporation. some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to invest in technology, capitalize on growth opportunities, and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete. consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage. in addition, some governments, such as china, have provided, and may continue to provide, significant financial assistance to some of our competitors or to new entrants. our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity, improve yields, reduce die size, and minimize mask levels in their product designs resulting in significant increases in the worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and downward pressure on prices. increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory also result from semiconductor memory fab capacity expansions, either by way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization, or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory production. our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply. we and some of our competitors have plans to or are constructing or ramping production at new fabrication facilities. increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory, if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand, would lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. if competitors are more successful at developing or implementing new product or process technology their products could have cost or performance advantages.
debt obligations could adversely affect our financial condition.
in recent periods, our debt levels have increased due to the capital intensive nature of our business, business acquisitions, and restructuring of our capital structure. as of september 1, 2016, we had debt with a carrying value of $9.91 billion. in 2016, 2015, and 2014 we paid $94 million, $1.43 billion, $2.30 billion, respectively, to repurchase and settle conversion obligations for convertible notes with principal amounts of and $57 million, $489 million, and $1.09 billion, respectively. as of september 1, 2016, we had a revolving credit facility available for up to $488 million of additional financing. the availability of this revolving facility is subject to certain conditions, including outstanding balances of eligible receivables. events and circumstances may occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy these applicable draw-down conditions and utilize this facility. we have incurred in the past, and expect to incur in the future, debt to finance our capital investments, business acquisitions, and restructuring of our capital structure. in 2016, we issued $1.25 billion of our 2023 secured notes and $750 million of our 2022 term loan b, and received an aggregate of $765 million in equipment sale-leaseback financing transactions. in connection with our proposed acquisition of the remaining interest in inotera, we plan to fund a portion of the acquisition with a loan of up to 80 billion new taiwan dollars (equivalent to $2.5 billion) under the term loan facility and, at our option, 12.6 billion new taiwan dollars (equivalent to $396 million) of 2021 convertible notes. the date for the closing of the inotera transaction has been set by the inotera board for december 6, 2016.  consummation of the inotera transaction remains subject to certain closing conditions and there can be no assurance that the inotera transaction will be consummated.
our debt obligations could adversely impact us. for example, these obligations could:
•   require us to use a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on debt, which will reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, r&amp;d expenditures, and other business activities;
•   require us and our mstw subsidiary to comply with financial covenants, which, if mstw fails to maintain could result in all obligations owing under the term loan agreement being accelerated to be immediately due and payable and if we or mstw fail to maintain, could result in an increase to the applicable interest rate;
•   adversely impact our credit rating, which could increase future borrowing costs;
•   limit our future ability to raise funds for capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities, r&amp;d, and other general corporate requirements;
•   restrict micron's ability and that of its domestic restricted subsidiaries to create or incur certain liens and enter into sale-leaseback financing transactions;
•   increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and semiconductor memory industry conditions;
•   continue to dilute our earnings per share as a result of the conversion provisions in our convertible notes; and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flows in the future. this, to some extent, is subject to market, economic, financial, competitive, legislative, and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. there can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that additional capital will be available to us, in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs. if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. if we were unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may be unable to meet our debt payment obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations, make scheduled debt payments, and make adequate capital investments.
our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory sold, average selling prices, and manufacturing costs. to develop new product and process technologies, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality, we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology, capital equipment, facilities, r&d, and product and process technology. we estimate that net cash expenditures in 2017 for property, plant, and equipment will be approximately $4.8 billion to $5.2 billion, which reflects the offset of amounts we expect to be funded by our partners. investments in capital expenditures, offset by amounts funded by our partners, were $5.40 billion for 2016. as of september 1, 2016, we had cash and marketable investments of $4.81 billion. as of september 1, 2016, $919 million of cash and equivalents and short-term investments, including substantially all of the $896 million held by the mmj group, were held by foreign subsidiaries whose earnings were considered to be indefinitely reinvested and repatriation of these funds to the u.s. would subject these funds to u.s. federal income taxes. in addition, cash held by imft of $98 million was generally not available to finance our other operations.
as a result of the japan proceedings, for so long as such proceedings are continuing, the mmj companies and their subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions on dividends, loans, and advances. the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies prohibit the mmj companies from paying dividends, including any cash dividends, to us and require that excess earnings be used in their businesses or to fund the mmj companies' installment payments. these prohibitions would also effectively prevent the subsidiaries of the mmj companies from paying cash dividends to us in respect of the shares of such subsidiaries owned by the mmj companies, as any such dividends would have to be first paid to the mmj companies which are prohibited from repaying those amounts to us as dividends under the plans of reorganization. in addition, pursuant to an order of the japan court, the mmj companies cannot make loans or advances, other than certain ordinary course advances, to us without the consent of the japan court. moreover, loans or advances by subsidiaries of the mmj companies may be considered outside of the ordinary course of business and subject to approval of the legal trustees and japan court. as a result, the assets of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries, while available to satisfy the mmj companies' installment payments and the other obligations, capital expenditures, and other operating needs of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries, are not available for use by us in our other operations. furthermore, certain uses of the assets of the mmj group, including investments in certain capital expenditures and in mmt, may require consent of mmj's trustees and/or the japan court.
in the past we have utilized external sources of financing when needed. as a result of our debt levels, expected debt amortization, and general economic conditions, it may be difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us. there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows, use cash held by mmj to fund its capital expenditures, access capital markets or find other sources of financing to fund our operations, make debt payments, and make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency. our inability to do the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial conditions.
our proposed acquisition of the remaining shares of inotera involves numerous risks.
in the second quarter of 2016, we entered into agreements to acquire the remaining interest in inotera for 30 new taiwan dollars per share in cash (equivalent to approximately $0.95 per share). as of september 1, 2016, we held a 33% ownership interest in inotera, nanya and certain of its affiliates held a 32% ownership interest, and the remaining ownership interest in inotera was publicly held. based on the exchange rate as of september 1, 2016, we estimate the aggregate consideration payable for the 67% of inotera shares not owned by us would be approximately $4.1 billion. we anticipate financing the acquisition with a combination of the following:
•   80 billion new taiwan dollar (equivalent to $2.5 billion) five-year term loan facility at a variable rate equal to the three-month or six-month taibor, at our or inotera's option, plus a margin of 2.05% per annum under the term loan facility;
•   additional borrowings under our existing credit agreement; and on march 29, 2016, the transaction was approved by the shareholders of inotera, including nanya and certain of nanya's affiliates (which approval was provided pursuant to voting and support agreements). on october 11, 2016, the inotera board set the date for the closing of the transaction to be december 6, 2016. consummation of the inotera transaction is subject to significant uncertainties, certain termination rights, and various conditions, including regulatory approvals and the consummation of debt financing. there can be no assurance that the various conditions will be satisfied or that the inotera transaction will ultimately be consummated. if the remaining closing conditions are not satisfied or waived, we will be unable to close the acquisition.
in addition to the acquisition risks described elsewhere, the acquisition is expected to involve the following significant risks:
•   we may be unable to realize the anticipated financial benefits of the acquisition;
•   increased exposure to the dram market, which experienced significant declines in pricing during 2015 and 2016;
•   our consolidated financial condition may be adversely impacted by the increased leverage resulting from the transaction;
•   higher capital expenditures in future periods;
•   increased exposure to operating costs denominated in new taiwan dollars;
•   integration issues with inotera's manufacturing operations in taiwan; and
•   integration of business systems and processes.
our proposed acquisition of the remaining shares of inotera is inherently risky, may not be successful, and may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. (see "part ii - item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - proposed acquisition of inotera.")
our future success depends on our ability to develop and produce competitive new memory technologies.
our key semiconductor memory technologies of dram and nand flash face technological barriers to continue to meet long-term customer needs. these barriers include potential limitations on the ability to shrink products in order to reduce costs, meet higher density requirements, and improve power consumption and reliability. to meet these requirements, we expect that new memory technologies will be developed by the semiconductor memory industry. our competitors are working to develop new memory technologies that may offer performance and cost advantages to our existing memory technologies and render existing technologies obsolete. accordingly, our future success may depend on our ability to develop and produce viable and competitive new memory technologies. there can be no assurance of the following:
•   that we will be successful in developing competitive new semiconductor memory technologies;
•   that we will be able to successfully market these technologies; and
•   that margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts.
in 2015, we announced the development of new 3d xpoint technology, which is an entirely new class of non-volatile memory. there is no assurance that our efforts to develop and market this new product technology will be successful. if our efforts to develop new semiconductor memory technologies are unsuccessful, our business, results of operations, or financial condition may be materially adversely affected.
new product development may be unsuccessful.
we are developing new products, including system-level memory products, which complement our traditional memory products or leverage their underlying design or process technology. we have made significant investments in product and process technologies and anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product development over the next several years. the process to develop dram, nand flash, and certain specialty memory products, requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality and performance, many times well in advance of a planned ramp of production, in order to secure design wins with our customers. there can be no assurance of the following:
•that our product development efforts will be successful;
•that we will be able to successfully market these products;
•that we will be able to qualify new products with our customers on a timely basis; or
•that margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts.
if our efforts to develop new products are unsuccessful, our business, results of operations, or financial condition may be materially adversely affected.
products that fail to meet specifications, are defective, or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us.
products that do not meet specifications or that contain, or are perceived by our customers to contain, defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. from time to time we experience problems with nonconforming, defective or incompatible products after we have shipped such products. in recent periods we have further diversified and expanded our product offerings which could potentially increase the chance that one or more of our products could fail to meet specifications in a particular application. as a result of these problems we could be adversely affected in several ways, including the following:
•   we may be required to compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or incompatible product and to replace products;
•   we could incur a decrease in revenue or adjustment to pricing commensurate with the reimbursement of such costs or alleged damages; and
•   we may encounter adverse publicity, which could cause a decrease in sales of our products.
a determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others or entering into a license agreement covering such intellectual property could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
as is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries, from time to time others have asserted, and may in the future assert, that our products or manufacturing processes infringe their intellectual property rights. we are unable to predict the outcome of assertions of infringement made against us. a determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others, or entering a license agreement covering such intellectual property, could result in significant liability and/or require us to make material changes to our products and/or manufacturing processes. any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. (see "part ii - item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - contingencies.")
we have a number of intellectual property license agreements. some of these license agreements require us to make one-time or periodic payments. we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future. we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms.
the acquisition of our ownership interest in inotera from qimonda has been challenged by the administrator of the insolvency proceedings for qimonda.
on january 20, 2011, dr. michael jaffé, administrator for qimonda insolvency proceedings, filed suit against micron and micron semiconductor b.v., our netherlands subsidiary ("micron b.v."), in the district court of munich, civil chamber. the complaint seeks to void under section 133 of the german insolvency act a share purchase agreement between micron b.v. and qimonda signed in fall 2008 pursuant to which micron b.v. purchased substantially all of qimonda's shares of inotera memories, inc. (the "inotera shares"), representing approximately 55% of our total shares in inotera as of september 1, 2016, and seeks an order requiring us to re-transfer those shares to the qimonda estate. the complaint also seeks, among other things, to recover damages for the alleged value of the joint venture relationship with inotera and to terminate under sections 103 or 133 of the german insolvency code a patent cross-license between us and qimonda entered into at the same time as the share purchase agreement.
following a series of hearings with pleadings, arguments, and witnesses on behalf of the qimonda estate, on march 13, 2014, the court issued judgments:  (1) ordering micron b.v. to pay approximately $1 million in respect of certain inotera shares sold in connection with the original share purchase; (2) ordering micron b.v. to disclose certain information with respect to any inotera shares sold by it to third parties; (3) ordering micron b.v. to disclose the benefits derived by it from ownership of the inotera shares, including in particular, any profits distributed on such shares and all other benefits; (4) denying qimonda's claims against micron for any damages relating to the joint venture relationship with inotera; and (5) determining that qimonda's obligations under the patent cross-license agreement are canceled. in addition, the court issued interlocutory judgments ordering, among other things:  (1) that micron b.v. transfer to the qimonda estate the inotera shares still owned by it and pay to the qimonda estate compensation in an amount to be specified for any inotera shares sold to third parties; and (2) that micron b.v. pay the qimonda estate as compensation an amount to be specified for benefits derived by it from ownership of the inotera shares. the interlocutory judgments have no immediate, enforceable effect on us, and, accordingly, we expect to be able to continue to operate with full control of the inotera shares subject to further developments in the case. we have filed a notice of appeal, and the parties have submitted briefs to the appeals court.
we are unable to predict the outcome of the matter and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss. the final resolution of this lawsuit could result in the loss of the inotera shares or monetary damages, unspecified damages based on the benefits derived by micron b.v. from the ownership of the inotera shares, and/or the termination of the patent cross-license, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, or financial condition.  as of september 1, 2016, the inotera shares had a carrying value for purposes of our financial reporting of $674 million and a market value of $996 million.
our joint ventures and strategic relationships involve numerous risks.
we have entered into strategic relationships to manufacture products and develop new manufacturing process technologies and products. these relationships include our imft joint venture with intel and our inotera joint venture with nanya. these joint ventures and strategic relationships are subject to various risks that could adversely affect the value of our investments and our results of operations. these risks include the following:
•   our interests could diverge from our partners or we may not be able to agree with partners on ongoing manufacturing and operational activities, or on the amount, timing, or nature of further investments in our joint venture;
•   our joint venture partners' products may compete with our products;
•   we may experience difficulties in transferring technology to joint ventures;
•   our control over the operations of our joint ventures is limited;
•   we may recognize losses from our equity method investments;
•   due to financial constraints, our joint venture partners may be unable to meet their commitments to us or our joint ventures and may pose credit risks for our transactions with them;
•   due to differing business models or long-term business goals, we and our partners may not participate to the same extent on funding capital investments in our joint ventures;
•   cash flows may be inadequate to fund increased capital requirements;
•   changes in tax, legal, or regulatory requirements may necessitate changes in the agreements with our partners.
if our joint ventures and strategic relationships are unsuccessful, our business, results of operations, or financial condition may be materially adversely affected.
if our manufacturing process is disrupted, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
we manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance. difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs. we maintain operations and continuously implement new product and process technology at our manufacturing operations which are widely dispersed in multiple locations in several countries including the u.s., singapore, taiwan, japan, malaysia, and china. additionally, our control over operations at imft, inotera, and tera probe is limited by our agreements with our partners. from time to time, we have experienced disruptions in our manufacturing process as a result of power outages, improperly functioning equipment, equipment failures, earthquakes, or other environmental events. if production at a fabrication facility is disrupted for any reason, manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers' requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers. this could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs, loss of revenues, or damage to customer relationships, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
we may incur additional restructure charges in future periods.
in the fourth quarter of 2016, we initiated a restructure plan in response to the current business environment and the need to accelerate focus on our key priorities in which we expect to save, as compared to our previously planned spending levels, approximately $80 million per quarter in 2017. the savings are expected to result from a combination of a more focused set of projects and programs, the permanent closure of a number of open headcount requisitions, workforce reductions in certain areas of the business, and other non-headcount related spending reductions. in connection with the plan, we expect to incur charges of $80 million, substantially all in cash expenditures, of which $58 million was incurred in 2016, with the remainder in the early part of 2017.
we may not realize the expected quarterly cost savings. we may also incur additional restructure charges or other losses associated with other initiatives in future periods. in connection with those initiatives, we could incur restructure charges, loss of production output, loss of key personnel, disruptions in our operations, and difficulties in the timely delivery of products.
because the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies provide for ongoing payments to creditors following the closing of our acquisition of mmj, the japan proceedings are continuing, and the mmj companies remain subject to the oversight of the japan court and of the trustees (including a trustee designated by us, who we refer to as the business trustee, and a trustee designated by the japan court, who we refer to as the legal trustee), pending completion of the japan proceedings. the japan proceedings and oversight of the japan court are expected to continue until the final creditor payment is made under the mmj companies' plans of reorganization, which is scheduled to occur in december 2019, but may occur on a later date to the extent any claims of creditors remain unfixed on the final scheduled installment payment date. although we may be able to petition the court to terminate the japan proceedings once two-thirds of all payments under the plans of reorganization are made, there can be no assurance that the japan court will grant any such petition.
during the pendency of the japan proceedings, the mmj companies are obligated to provide periodic financial reports to the japan court and may be required to obtain the consent of the japan court prior to taking a number of significant actions relating to their businesses, including transferring or disposing of, or acquiring, certain material assets, incurring or guaranteeing material indebtedness, settling disputes, or entering into certain material agreements. the consent of the legal trustee may also be required for matters that would likely have a material impact on the operations or assets of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries or for transfers of material assets, to the extent the matters or transfers would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect execution of the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies. accordingly, during the pendency of the japan proceedings, our ability to effectively operate the mmj companies as part of our global operations or to cause the mmj companies to take certain actions that we deem advisable for their businesses could be adversely affected if the japan court or the legal trustee is unwilling to consent to various actions that we may wish to take with respect to the mmj companies.
our inotera supply agreement involves numerous risks.
in 2016, we purchased $1.43 billion of dram products from inotera and our supply from inotera accounted for 30% of our aggregate dram gigabit production. in 2015 and 2014, our cost for inotera products was higher than the cost for similar products manufactured in our wholly-owned facilities. due to declines in average selling prices, our per gigabit cost of products purchased from inotera decreased throughout 2015 and the first half of 2016 such that our cost for inotera products more closely approximated our cost for similar products manufactured in our wholly-owned facilities for the second and third quarters of 2016.  due to improvements in average selling prices in late 2016 coupled with decreases in manufacturing costs of our wholly-owned operations, our cost for inotera products increased and were approximately 20% higher than our cost for similar products manufactured in our wholly-owned facilities for the fourth quarter of 2016. if our supply of dram from inotera is impacted, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. our inotera supply agreement involves numerous risks including the following:
•   higher costs for supply obtained under the inotera supply agreement as compared to our wholly-owned facilities;
•   difficulties in transferring technology to inotera; and
•   difficulties in coming to an agreement with nanya regarding major corporate decisions, such as capital expenditures or capital structure.
changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
across our global operations, certain transactions and balances are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar (our reporting currency), primarily the euro, singapore dollar, new taiwan dollar, and yen. we recorded net losses from changes in currency exchange rates of $24 million for 2016, $27 million for 2015, and $28 million for 2014. based on our foreign currency balances from monetary assets and liabilities we estimate that a 10% adverse change in exchange rates versus the u.s. dollar would result in losses of approximately $241 million as of september 1, 2016. although we hedge our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates from our monetary assets and liabilities by utilizing a rolling hedge strategy for our primary currency exposures with currency forward contracts that generally mature within 35 days, the effectiveness of these hedges is dependent upon our ability to accurately forecast our monetary assets and liabilities. in addition, a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in foreign currencies. exchange rates for some of these currencies against the u.s. dollar, particularly the yen, have been volatile in recent periods. if these currencies strengthen against the u.s. dollar, our manufacturing costs could significantly increase. in the event that exchange rates for the u.s. dollar adversely change against our foreign currency exposures, our results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected. in addition, in connection with our proposed acquisition of inotera, our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates could increase if not offset by corresponding hedges.
we may make future acquisitions and/or alliances, which involve numerous risks.
acquisitions and the formation or operation of alliances, such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements, involve numerous risks including the following:
•   integrating the operations, technologies, and products of acquired or newly formed entities into our operations;
•   increasing capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain facilities;
•   the assumption of unknown or underestimated liabilities;
•   the use of cash to finance a transaction, which may reduce the availability of cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures, r&amp;d expenditures, and other business activities;
•   diverting management's attention from daily operations;
•   managing larger or more complex operations and facilities and employees in separate and diverse geographic areas;
•   requirements imposed by governmental authorities in connection with the regulatory review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures or restrictions on the conduct of our business or the acquired business;
•   inability to realize synergies or other expected benefits;
•   failure to maintain customer, vendor, and other relationships;
•   inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company's internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and/or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices; and
•   impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions, technological advancements, or worse-than-expected performance of the acquired business.
in previous years, supply of memory products has significantly exceeded customer demand resulting in significant declines in average selling prices for dram, nand flash, and nor flash products. resulting operating losses have led to the deterioration in the financial condition of a number of industry participants, including the liquidation of qimonda and the 2012 bankruptcy filing by elpida (now known as mmj). these types of proceedings often lead to court-directed processes involving the sale of related businesses or assets. we believe the global memory industry is experiencing a period of consolidation as a result of these market conditions and other factors, and we may engage in discussions regarding potential acquisitions and similar opportunities arising out of these industry conditions. to the extent we are successful in completing any such transactions, we could be subject to some or all of the risks described above, including the risks pertaining to funding, assumption of liabilities, integration challenges, and increases in debt that may accompany such transactions. acquisitions of, or alliances with, high-technology companies are inherently risky and may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
breaches of our security systems could expose us to losses.
we maintain a system of controls over the physical security of our facilities. we also manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations. in addition, we process, store, and transmit large amounts of data relating to our customers and employees, including sensitive personal information. unauthorized persons or employees may gain access to our facilities or network systems to steal trade secrets or other proprietary information, compromise confidential information, create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. these parties may also be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that disrupt our operations and create security vulnerabilities. breaches of our physical security and attacks on our network systems could result in significant losses and damage our reputation with customers and suppliers, and could expose us to litigation if the confidential information of our customers, suppliers, or employees is compromised.
compliance with regulations regarding the use of conflict minerals could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.
increased focus on environmental protection and social responsibility initiatives led to the passage of section 1502 of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 (the "dodd-frank act") and its implementing securities and exchange commission regulations.  the dodd-frank act imposes supply chain diligence and disclosure requirements for certain manufacturers of products containing specific minerals that may originate in or near the democratic republic of the congo (the "drc") and finance or benefit local armed groups. these "conflict minerals" are commonly found in materials used in the manufacture of semiconductors. the implementation of these new regulations may limit the sourcing and availability of some of these materials. this in turn may affect our ability to obtain materials necessary for the manufacture of our products in sufficient quantities and may affect related material pricing. some of our customers may elect to disqualify us as a supplier or reduce purchases from us if we are unable to verify that our products are drc conflict free.
we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations that may result in additional costs and liabilities.
the manufacturing of our products requires the use of facilities, equipment, and materials that are subject to a broad array of laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions in which we operate. additionally, we are subject to a variety of other laws and regulations relative to the construction, maintenance, and operations of our facilities. any of these laws or regulations could cause us to incur additional direct costs, as well as increased indirect costs related to our relationships with our customers and suppliers, and otherwise harm our operations and financial condition. any failure to comply with these laws or regulations could adversely impact our reputation and our financial results. additionally, we partner with other companies in our joint ventures, which are also subject to a broad array of laws and regulations. our ownership in these joint ventures may also expose us to risks associated with their respective compliance with these laws and regulations. our failure, or the failure of our joint ventures, to comply with these laws and regulations could result in:
•   remediation costs;
•   alteration of our manufacturing processes;
•   regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities; and
•   reputational challenges.
we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure.
we operate in a number of locations outside the u.s., including in singapore, and, to a lesser extent, taiwan, where we have tax incentive arrangements that are conditional, in part, upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds. our domestic and international taxes are dependent upon the distribution of our earnings among these different jurisdictions. our provision for income taxes and cash tax liabilities in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including challenges by tax authorities to our tax structure and intercompany transfer pricing agreements, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, failure to meet performance obligations with respect to tax incentive agreements, and changes in tax laws and regulations. we file income tax returns with the u.s. federal government, various u.s. states, and various other jurisdictions throughout the world.  our u.s. federal and state tax returns remain open to examination for 2012 through 2016.  in addition, tax returns open to examination in singapore, japan, and taiwan range from the years 2011 to 2016. the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability.
we may not utilize all of our net deferred tax assets.
we have substantial deferred tax assets, which include, among others, net operating loss and credit carryforwards. as of september 1, 2016, our u.s. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, including uncertain tax benefits, were $3.90 billion and $1.94 billion, respectively, which, if not utilized, will expire at various dates from 2017 through 2036. as of september 1, 2016, our foreign net operating loss carryforwards were $6.04 billion, including $4.28 billion pertaining to japan, which will, if not utilized, substantially all expire at various dates from 2019 through 2025. as of september 1, 2016, we had valuation allowances of $1.16 billion and $765 million against our net deferred tax assets in the u.s. and japan, respectively.
a change in ownership may limit our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards.
if we experience a 50% or greater change in ownership involving shareholders owning 5% or more of our stock, it could adversely impact our ability to utilize our existing net operating loss and credit carryforwards. the inability to utilize existing net operating loss and credit carryforwards would significantly increase the amount of our annual cash taxes reducing the overall amount of cash available to be used in other areas of the business.
on july 20, 2016, our board of directors adopted a section 382 rights agreement (the "rights agreement"), under which our shareholders of record as of the close of business on august 1, 2016 received one right for each share of common stock outstanding. the rights agreement is intended to avoid an ownership change, as defined by section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, and thereby preserve our current ability to utilize certain net operating loss and credit carryforwards. in general, an ownership change will occur when the percentage of our ownership by one or more 5% shareholders has increased by more than 50% at any time during the prior three years. pursuant to the rights agreement, if a shareholder (or group) acquires beneficial ownership of 4.99% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock without prior approval of our board of directors or without meeting certain customary exceptions, the rights would become exercisable and entitle shareholders (other than the acquiring shareholder or group) to purchase additional shares of our common stock at a significant discount and result in significant dilution in the economic interest and voting power of acquiring shareholder or group. although the rights agreement is intended to reduce the likelihood of an ownership change that could adversely affect us, there is no assurance that the rights agreement will prevent all transfers that could result in such an ownership change. the rights agreement is subject to shareholder approval at the company's fiscal 2016 annual meeting of shareholders. if not approved by the shareholders, the rights agreement will terminate on july 19, 2017.
the limited availability of raw materials, supplies, or capital equipment could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
our operations require raw materials, and in certain cases, third party services, that meet exacting standards. we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and services. however, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials and services that meet our standards. in some cases, materials, components, or services are provided by a single supplier. various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials or components such as silicon wafers, controllers, photomasks, chemicals, gases, photoresist, lead frames, and molding compound. shortages may occur from time to time in the future. we and/or our suppliers could be affected by laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change, which could increase the cost and limit the supply of our raw materials. in addition, disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials. lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past. if our supply of raw materials or services is disrupted or our lead times extended, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
our operations are dependent on our ability to procure advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment that enables the transition to lower cost manufacturing processes. for certain key types of equipment, including photolithography tools, we are sometimes dependent on a single supplier. from time to time we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to the supplier's limited capacity. our inability to obtain this equipment timely could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing processes and reduce costs. delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production at new facilities and increase our overall costs of the ramp. if we are unable to obtain advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment in a timely manner, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
a downturn in the worldwide economy may harm our business.
downturns in the worldwide economy have harmed our business in the past and future downturns could also adversely affect our business. adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that incorporate our products, such as personal computers, mobile devices, ssds, and servers. reduced demand for these products could result in significant decreases in our average selling prices and product sales. a deterioration of current conditions in worldwide credit markets could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures. in addition, we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties. difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of loss on our accounts receivables due to credit defaults. as a result, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
our results of operations could be affected by natural disasters and other events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate.
we have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and geological events including earthquakes or tsunamis that could disrupt operations.  in addition, our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations.  a natural disaster, fire, explosion, or other event that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations, or the operations of our customers or suppliers, may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
we face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
sales to customers outside the united states approximated 84% of our consolidated net sales for 2016. in addition, a substantial portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside the united states. in particular, a significant portion of our manufacturing operations are concentrated in singapore, taiwan, and japan. our international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks, including:
•   export and import duties, changes to import and export regulations, customs regulations and processes, and restrictions on the transfer of funds;
•   compliance with u.s. and international laws involving international operations, including the foreign corrupt practices act, export and import laws, and similar rules and regulations;
•   political and economic instability;
•   problems with the transportation or delivery of our products;
•   compliance with trade, technical standards, and other laws in a variety of jurisdictions;
•   contractual and regulatory limitations on our ability to maintain flexibility with our staffing levels;
•   disruptions to our manufacturing operations as a result of actions imposed by foreign governments;
•   changes in economic policies of foreign governments; and these factors may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
we have numerous arrangements with financial institutions that subject us to counterparty default risks, including cash deposits, investments, capped-call contracts on our stock, and derivative instruments. as a result, we are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these arrangements will default on its performance obligations. a counterparty may not comply with their contractual commitments which could then lead to their defaulting on their obligations with little or no notice to us, which could limit our ability to take action to mitigate our exposure. additionally, our ability to mitigate our exposures may be constrained by the terms of our contractual arrangements or because market conditions prevent us from taking effective action. if one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy, our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterparty's default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable laws governing the bankruptcy proceeding. in the event of such default, we could incur significant losses, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains trend information and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements such as those made regarding the acquisition of the remaining shares of inotera; changes in future depreciation expense; future costs and savings for restructure activities; our pursuit of additional financing and debt restructuring including expected funding of the inotera acquisition; the sufficiency of our cash and investments, cash flows from operations, and available financing to meet our requirements for at least the next 12 months; capital spending in 2017; and the timing of payments for certain contractual obligations. we are under no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. our actual results could differ materially from our historical results and those discussed in the forward-looking statements. factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include, but are not limited to, those identified in "part i, item 1a. risk factors." this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the year ended september 1, 2016. all period references are to our fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated. our fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period ending on the thursday closest to august 31. our fiscal 2016 contained 52 weeks, fiscal 2015 contained 53 weeks, and fiscal 2014 contained 52 weeks. all production data includes the production of imft and inotera. all tabular dollar amounts are in millions except per share amounts.
our management's discussion and analysis ("md&a") is provided in addition to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to assist readers in understanding our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. md&a is organized as follows:

total net sales for 2016 decreased 23% as compared to 2015 primarily due to lower cnbu, mbu, and sbu sales as declines in average selling prices outpaced increases in gigabit sales volumes. the increases in gigabit sales volumes for 2016 were primarily attributable to higher manufacturing output due to improvements in product and process technologies partially offset by reductions resulting from transitions to the next technology node.
total net sales for 2015 decreased 1% as compared to 2014 primarily due to lower cnbu sales as a result of decreases in dram sales as declines in average selling prices outpaced increases in gigabit sales volumes. sbu and mbu sales for 2015 increased as compared to 2014 as a result of higher nand flash sales due to increases in gigabit sales volumes partially offset by declines in average selling prices. the increases in gigabit sales volumes for 2015 were primarily attributable to higher manufacturing output due to improvements in product and process technologies. ebu sales for 2015 increased as compared to 2014 due to higher sales volumes as a result of increases in market demand.
gross margin our overall gross margin percentage declined to 20% for 2016 from 32% for 2015 primarily due to declines in the gross margin percentages for cnbu, mbu, and sbu, as decreases in average selling prices outpaced manufacturing cost reductions. ebu's gross margin percentage for 2016 was relatively unchanged from 2015 as manufacturing cost reductions offset declines in average selling prices.
from january 2013 through december 2015, we purchased all of inotera's dram output under supply agreements at prices reflecting discounts from market prices for our comparable components. effective beginning on january 1, 2016, the price for dram products purchased by us is based on a formula that equally shares margin between inotera and us. we purchased $1.43 billion, $2.37 billion, and $2.68 billion of dram products from inotera in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. dram products purchased from inotera accounted for 30% of our aggregate dram gigabit production for 2016 as compared to 35% for 2015 and 38% for 2014. in 2015 and 2014, our cost for inotera products was higher than our cost for similar products manufactured in our wholly-owned facilities. due to declines in average selling prices, our per gigabit cost of products purchased from inotera decreased throughout 2015 and the first half of 2016 such that our cost for inotera products more closely approximated our cost for similar products manufactured in our wholly-owned facilities for the second and third quarters of 2016.  due to improvements in average selling prices in late 2016 coupled with decreases in manufacturing costs of our wholly-owned operations, our cost for inotera products increased and were approximately 20% higher than our cost for similar products manufactured in our wholly-owned facilities for the fourth quarter of 2016. the current supply agreement with inotera has an initial three-year term, which commenced on january 1, 2016, followed by a three-year wind-down period. upon termination of the initial three-year term, the share of inotera's capacity we would purchase would decline over the wind-down period.
our overall gross margin percentage declined to 32% for 2015 from 33% for 2014 primarily due to declines in average selling prices partially offset by manufacturing cost reductions. cnbu and sbu experienced declines in gross margin percentage for 2015 as compared to 2014 as declines in average selling price outpaced manufacturing cost reductions. mbu's gross margin percentage for 2015 improved as compared to 2014 as manufacturing cost reductions outpaced declines in average selling prices.
due to the lengthening period of time between dram product technology node transitions, an increased re-use rate of equipment, and industry trends, we revised the estimated useful lives of equipment in our dram wafer fabrication facilities from five to seven years in the fourth quarter of 2016. for 2016, the effect of the revision was not material and we expect this change will reduce depreciation costs by approximately $100 million per quarter in future periods.
operating results by business segments cnbu for the year ended        2016                2015                2014
cnbu sales and operating results are significantly impacted by average selling prices, gigabit sales volumes, and cost per gigabit of our dram products. (see "operating results by product - dram" for further detail.) cnbu sales for 2016 decreased 33% as compared to 2015 primarily due to declines in average selling prices as a result of continued weakness in the pc sector, partially offset by increases in gigabits sold. cnbu operating margin for 2016 declined from 2015 as decreases in average selling prices outpaced manufacturing cost reductions.
cnbu sales for 2015 decreased 8% as compared to 2014 primarily due to declines in average selling prices as a result of continued weakness in the pc sector, partially offset by increases in gigabits sold. cnbu operating margin for 2015 declined from 2014 as decreases in average selling prices outpaced manufacturing cost reductions.

sbu sales and operating results are significantly impacted by average selling prices, gigabit sales volumes, and cost per gigabit of our non-volatile memory products. (see "operating results by product - trade non-volatile memory" for further details.) sbu sales for 2016 decreased 12% from 2015 primarily due to declines in average selling prices partially offset by increases in gigabits sold. sbu sales included non-trade non-volatile memory sales of $501 million, $463 million, and $475 million, for 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
sbu sales of trade non-volatile memory products for 2016 decreased 16% from 2015 primarily due to declines in average selling prices partially offset by increases in gigabits sold. sbu operating margin for 2016 declined from 2015 as decreases in average selling prices outpaced manufacturing cost reductions.
sbu sales of trade non-volatile memory products for 2015 increased 7% as compared to 2014 primarily due to increases in gigabits sold partially offset by declines in average selling prices. increases in gigabits sold for 2015 as compared to 2014 were primarily due to higher manufacturing output. sbu operating margin for 2015 declined from 2014 as decreases in average selling prices outpaced manufacturing cost reductions and r&d costs increased in connection with increased spending on controllers, firmware, and engineering for ssds and managed nand flash products.
mbu for the year ended                2016                2015                2014
mbu sales are comprised primarily of dram and nand flash, with mobile dram products accounting for a significant majority of the sales. mbu sales for 2016 decreased 30% as compared to 2015 primarily due to declines in average selling prices and dram gigabits sold. mbu operating income for 2016 declined from 2015 as decreases in average selling prices outpaced manufacturing cost reductions.
mbu sales for 2015 increased 2% as compared to 2014 primarily due to significant increases in gigabit sales volumes for managed nand flash and mcp products partially offset by lower sales of mobile dram products as a result of declines in average selling prices and sales volumes. mbu operating income for 2015 improved from 2014 as manufacturing cost reductions outpaced declines in average selling prices.

ebu sales are comprised of dram, nand flash, and nor flash in decreasing order of revenue. ebu sales for 2016 decreased 3% as compared to 2015 primarily due to declines in average selling prices for dram and nand flash products, which were partially offset by higher sales volumes as a result of increases in demand. ebu operating income for 2016 was relatively unchanged from 2015 as manufacturing cost reductions offset declines in average selling prices.
ebu sales for 2015 increased 13% as compared to 2014 primarily due to higher sales volumes of dram and nand flash products as a result of increases in demand. ebu operating income for 2015 improved as compared to 2014 primarily due to the higher sales volumes.

the increase in gigabits sold and decrease in cost per gigabit for 2016 and 2015 as compared to prior years, were primarily due to increases in gigabit production as a result of improvements in product and process technologies. lower costs for products purchased from inotera contributed to manufacturing cost reductions for 2016 and 2015. gigabit production and cost reductions for 2016 and 2015, were constrained by equipment downtime incurred in connection with transitioning from 25nm to 20nm-based products and a shift to a higher mix of ddr4 products, which have larger die sizes and fewer bits per wafer.
our gross margin percentage for 2016 declined as compared to 2015 as decreases in average selling prices outpaced manufacturing cost reductions. our gross margin percentage on sales of dram products for 2015 improved from 2014 as manufacturing cost reductions outpaced declines in average selling prices.

through 2016, substantially all of our trade non-volatile memory sales were from nand flash products. the increase in gigabits sold of trade non-volatile memory for 2016 as compared to 2015, was primarily due to increases in gigabit production due to improvements in product and process technology. increases in gigabit production for 2016 were constrained by equipment downtime incurred in connection with transitioning to 3d nand flash products. the increase in gigabits sold of trade non-volatile memory for 2015 as compared to 2014, was primarily due to higher production from improved product and process technologies and the transition of our wafer fabrication facility in singapore from dram to nand flash production. increases in gigabit production for 2015 as compared to 2014, were limited by a shift in product mix to higher levels of managed nand flash and mcp products, which have both higher average selling prices and costs per gigabit.
our gross margin percentage on sales of trade non-volatile memory products for 2016 declined from 2015 as decreases in average selling prices outpaced manufacturing cost reductions. our gross margin percentage on sales of trade non-volatile memory products for 2015 declined from 2014 as the decreases in average selling prices outpaced manufacturing cost reductions.
operating expenses and other selling, general, and administrative sg&a expenses for 2016 decreased 8% as compared to 2015 due to decreases in payroll costs resulting primarily from the suspension of variable-pay plans, decreases in travel costs, and an additional week in 2015.
sg&a expenses for 2015 increased 2% as compared to 2014 primarily due to an additional week in 2015 and higher legal costs.
research and development r&d expenses for 2016 increased 5% from 2015 primarily due to higher volumes of development wafers processed, higher payroll costs, and an increase in depreciation expense from r&d capital expenditures.
r&d expenses for 2015 increased 12% from 2014 primarily due to a higher volume of development wafers processed, an increase in depreciation expense due to r&d capital expenditures, higher payroll costs, higher subcontracted engineering and other professional service costs, and an additional week in 2015. increases in r&d expenses for 2015 as compared to 2014 were partly attributable to increased spending on controllers, firmware, and engineering to support system-level products, including ssd, managed nand flash, and hmc products.
we generally share with intel the costs of product design and process development activities for nand flash and 3d xpoint memory. our r&d expenses reflect net reductions as a result of reimbursements under our cost-sharing arrangements with intel and others of $208 million, $231 million, and $162 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
see further discussion of our r&d in "part i - item 1. - business - research and development."
restructure and asset impairments in the fourth quarter of 2016, we initiated a restructure plan in response to the current business environment and the need to accelerate focus on our key priorities in which we expect to save, as compared to our previously planned spending levels, approximately $80 million per quarter in 2017. the savings are expected to result from a combination of a more focused set of projects and programs, the permanent closure of a number of open headcount requisitions, workforce reductions in certain areas of the business, and other non-headcount related spending reductions. (see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - restructure and asset impairments.")
income taxes our effective tax rates were 6.8%, 6.0%, and 4.7% for 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, primarily reflecting provisions on non-u.s. operations. our effective tax rates reflect the following:
•   operations in tax jurisdictions, including singapore and taiwan, where our earnings are indefinitely reinvested and the tax rates are significantly lower than the u.s. statutory rate;
•   a valuation allowance against substantially all of our u.s. net deferred tax assets.
income taxes for 2016, 2015, and 2014 included $114 million, $80 million and $59 million, respectively, related to utilization of, and other changes in, deferred tax assets of mmj and mmt. income taxes for 2016 also included tax benefits of $58 million related to the favorable resolution of certain prior year tax matters, which were previously reserved as uncertain tax positions, and $41 million related to a u.s. valuation allowance release resulting from the acquisition of tidal systems, ltd. the remaining tax provision for 2016, 2015, and 2014 primarily reflects taxes on our other non-u.s. operations. income taxes on u.s. operations for 2016, 2015, and 2014 were substantially offset by changes in the valuation allowance.
we have a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax asset associated with our u.s. operations.  management continues to evaluate future projected financial performance to determine whether such performance is sufficient evidence to support a reduction in or reversal of the valuation allowance.  the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted if sufficient positive evidence exists.
we operate in a number of locations outside the u.s., including singapore and, to a lesser extent, taiwan, where we have tax incentive arrangements that are conditional, in part, upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds. the benefit of tax incentive arrangements, which expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2030, was not material to our tax provision for 2016 and reduced our tax provision for 2015 and 2014 by $338 million (benefitting our diluted earnings per share by $0.29) and $286 million ($0.24 per diluted share), respectively.

equity in net income (loss) of equity method investees we recognize our share of earnings or losses from equity method investments generally on a two-month lag. equity in net income (loss) of equity method investees, net of tax, included the following:
for the year ended            2016              2015              2014
our equity in net income (loss) of inotera declined for 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to declines in average selling prices and cost of transitioning to the next technology node. included in our earnings for 2015 was $49 million from inotera's full release of its valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets related to its net operating loss carryforward and the resulting tax provision in subsequent periods.
in 2016 and 2015, we recorded an impairment charge of $25 million and $10 million, respectively, within equity in net income (loss) of equity method investees to write down the carrying value of our investment in tera probe to its fair value based on its trading price.
other further discussion of other operating and non-operating income and expenses can be found in the following notes contained in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements":
•   equity plans
•   other non-operating income (expense), net liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and financing obtained from capital markets. cash generated from operations is highly dependent on selling prices for our products, which can vary significantly from period to period. we are continuously evaluating alternatives for efficiently funding capital expenditures and ongoing operations. we expect, from time to time in the future, to engage in a variety of transactions for such purposes, including the issuance or incurrence of secured and unsecured debt and the refinancing and restructuring of existing debt. as of september 1, 2016, we had a revolving credit facility available for up to $488 million of additional financing based on eligible receivables. we expect that our cash and investments, cash flows from operations, and available financing will be sufficient to meet our requirements at least through the next 12 months.
to develop new product and process technologies, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality, we must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies, facilities and equipment, and r&d. we estimate that net cash expenditures in 2017 for property, plant, and equipment will be approximately $4.8 billion to $5.2 billion, which reflects the offset of amounts we expect to be funded by our partners. the actual amounts for 2017 will vary depending on market conditions. total additions to property, plant, and equipment in 2016 were $7.01 billion, which, in comparison to cash expenditures, reflects differences in timing of receipts and payments for equipment as well as non-cash additions such as equipment leases. as of september 1, 2016, we had commitments of approximately $780 million for the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment, substantially all of which is expected to be paid within one year.
cash and equivalents and short-term investments          $4,398              $3,521
long-term marketable investments                            414               2,113
our investments consist primarily of liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. as of september 1, 2016, $1.32 billion of our cash and equivalents and short-term investments was held by foreign subsidiaries, primarily denominated in the u.s. dollar. to mitigate credit risk, we invest through high-credit-quality financial institutions and, by policy, generally limit the concentration of credit exposure by restricting the amount of investments with any single obligor.
proposed acquisition of inotera in the second quarter of 2016, we entered into agreements to acquire the remaining interest in inotera for 30 new taiwan dollars per share in cash (equivalent to approximately $0.95 per share, assuming 31.7 new taiwan dollars per u.s. dollar, the exchange rate as of september 1, 2016). based on the exchange rate as of september 1, 2016, we estimate the aggregate consideration payable for the 67% of inotera shares not owned by us would be approximately $4.1 billion.
acquisition financing: on october 11, 2016, we and inotera, as co-borrowers, entered into a single-draw term loan facility (the "term loan facility"), from which proceeds will be used to pay a portion of the acquisition consideration and any related transaction costs and to provide working capital for inotera. in the second and third quarters of 2016, we entered into agreements with nanya pursuant to which we have the option to issue a combination of shares of our common stock (the "micron shares") and 2.00% convertible senior notes due 2021 (the "2021 convertible notes") to nanya, which is subject to regulatory approvals and various other conditions.
term loan facility: the term loan facility can be made in a single draw on or prior to july 10, 2017, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, up to a maximum aggregate borrowing amount of 80 billion new taiwan dollars in cash (equivalent to $2.5 billion). the loan will bear interest at a variable rate equal to the three-month or six-month taibor, at our or inotera's option, plus a margin of 2.05% per annum, payable monthly in arrears. the loan will mature five years from the date it is made and principal is payable in six equal semi-annual installments, commencing thirty months after such loan is made.
the term loan facility will be collateralized by certain assets including a real estate mortgage on inotera's main production facility and site, a chattel mortgage over certain equipment of inotera, all of the stock of our mstw subsidiary and the approximately 80% of the stock of inotera held by mstw following the consummation of the acquisition. micron will guarantee all of inotera's and mstw's obligations under the term loan facility.
the term loan facility contains affirmative and negative covenants which are customary for financings of this type, including covenants that limit or restrict the ability to create liens in or dispose of collateral securing obligations under the term loan facility, mergers involving mstw and/or inotera, loans or guarantees to third parties by inotera and/or mstw, and mstw's distribution of cash dividends (subject to satisfaction of certain financial conditions). the term loan facility also contains financial covenants as follows, which are tested semi-annually:
•   mstw must maintain a consolidated ratio of total debt to ebitda not higher than 5.50x in 2017 and 2018; and not higher than 4.50x through 2019 to 2021.
•   on a consolidated basis, we must maintain a ratio of total debt to ebitda not higher than 3.50x in 2017; not higher than 3.00x in 2018 and 2019; and not higher than 2.50x in 2020 and 2021.
if one or more of the required financial ratios is not maintained at the time the ratios are tested, the interest rate will be increased by 0.25% until such time as the required financial ratios are maintained. in addition, if mstw fails to maintain a required financial ratio for two consecutive semi-annual periods, such failure will constitute an event of default that could result in all obligations owed under the term loan agreement being accelerated to be immediately due and payable. our failure to maintain a required consolidated financial ratio will only result in an increase to the applicable interest rate and will not constitute an event of default under the term loan facility. the term loan facility also contains customary events of default.
micron shares: we have the option to issue micron shares in an amount up to 31.5 billion new taiwan dollars (equivalent to $991 million) (the "private placement"), which would be used to fund a portion of the acquisition consideration. the per-share selling price for the micron shares would be equal to the greater of the new taiwan dollar equivalent of (i) the average of the closing sale price of our common stock during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on and including the 30th calendar day prior to the consummation of the inotera acquisition or (ii) $10.00.
2021 convertible notes: we have the option to issue 12.6 billion new taiwan dollars (equivalent to $396 million) in 2021 convertible notes in lieu of a corresponding value of micron shares so long as we also issue micron shares to nanya of at least 6.3 billion new taiwan dollars (equivalent to $198 million) pursuant to the private placement.
(see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - proposed acquisition of inotera.")
limitations on the use of cash and investments mmj group:  cash and equivalents and short-term investments in the table above included an aggregate of $896 million held by the mmj group as of september 1, 2016. as a result of the corporate reorganization proceedings of the mmj companies entered into in march 2012, and for so long as such proceedings are continuing, the mmj companies and their subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions on dividends, loans, and advances. the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies prohibit the mmj companies from paying dividends, including any cash dividends, to us and require that excess earnings be used in their businesses or to fund the mmj companies' installment payments. these prohibitions also effectively prevent the subsidiaries of the mmj companies from paying cash dividends. in addition, pursuant to an order of the japan court, the mmj companies cannot make loans or advances, other than certain ordinary course advances, to us without the consent of the japan court. moreover, loans or advances by subsidiaries of the mmj companies may be considered outside of the ordinary course of business and subject to approval of the legal trustee and japan court. as a result, the assets of the mmj group are not available for use by us in our other operations. furthermore, certain uses of the assets of the mmj group, including investments in certain capital expenditures and in mmt, may require consent of mmj's trustees and/or the japan court.
imft: cash and equivalents and short-term investments in the table above included $98 million held by imft as of september 1, 2016. our ability to access funds held by imft to finance our other operations is subject to agreement by intel and contractual limitations. amounts held by imft are not anticipated to be available to finance our other operations.
indefinitely reinvested: as of september 1, 2016, $919 million of cash and equivalents and short-term investments, including substantially all of the amounts held by the mmj group, was held by foreign subsidiaries whose earnings were considered to be indefinitely reinvested and repatriation of these funds to the u.s. would subject these funds to u.s. federal income taxes. determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities related to investments in these foreign subsidiaries is not practicable.
cash flows for the year ended                                                              september 1,         september 3,        august 28, net cash provided by operating activities                                      $3,168               $5,208             $5,699

operating activities: for 2016, cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to cash generated by our operations and the effect of working capital adjustments, which included $465 million of cash provided from reductions in receivables due to a lower level of net sales, offset by $549 million of cash used for net increases in inventories.
for 2015, cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to cash generated by operations and the effect of working capital adjustments, which included $393 of cash provided from reductions in receivables due to a lower level of net sales, offset by $691 million of cash used for reductions in accounts payable and accrued expenses.
for 2014, cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to cash generated by operations and the effect of working capital adjustments, which included $671 million of cash provided from increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses, offset by $518 million of cash used for increases in receivables.
investing activities: net cash used for investing activities for 2016 consisted primarily of $5.82 billion of expenditures for property, plant, and equipment (which excludes offsets of amounts funded by our partners) and $148 million for the acquisition of tidal systems, ltd., partially offset by $2.66 billion of net inflows from sales, maturities, and purchases of available-for-sale securities.
net cash used for investing activities for 2015 consisted primarily of $4.02 billion of expenditures for property, plant, and equipment (which excludes offsets of amounts funded by our partners) and $2.14 billion of net outflows for purchases, sales, and maturities of available-for-sale securities.
net cash used for investing activities for 2014 consisted primarily of $3.11 billion of expenditures for property, plant, and equipment (which excludes offsets of amounts funded by our partners) and $506 million of net outflows from purchases, sales, and maturities of available-for-sale securities offset by the use of $534 million of restricted cash in connection with the first mmj creditor installment payment.
financing activities: net cash provided by financing activities for 2016 consisted primarily of $1.25 billion from the issuance of our 2023 senior secured notes, $742 million (net of original issue discount) from the issuance of our 2022 term loan b notes, and $765 million from equipment sale-leaseback financing transactions, which were partially offset by cash outflows of $870 million for repayments of debt and $125 million for the open-market repurchases of 7 million shares of our common stock.
net cash used for financing activities for 2015 consisted primarily of $2.33 billion for repayments of debt (including $932 million for the amount in excess of principal of our convertible notes), $831 million for the open-market repurchases of 42 million shares of our common stock, and $95 million of payments on equipment purchase contracts. cash outflows for financing activities in 2015 were partially offset by inflows of $2.00 billion in aggregate from the issuance of the 2023 notes, 2024 notes, and 2026 notes, $291 million from proceeds of sale-leaseback transactions, $125 million from draws on our revolving credit facilities, and $87 million from term loans.
net cash used for financing activities for 2014 consisted primarily of $3.84 billion for repayments of debt (including $1.20 billion for the amount in excess of principal of our convertible notes) offset by $2.21 billion of proceeds from issuance of debt, $265 million of proceeds from issuance of common stock under our equity plans, and by $92 million of net cash received from noncontrolling interests.

potential settlement obligations of convertible notes since the closing price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days in the 30 trading day period ended on june 30, 2016 did not exceed 130% of the conversion price per share of our 2032 notes and 2033 notes, those notes were not convertible by the holders during the calendar quarter ended september 30, 2016. the closing price of our common stock exceeded the thresholds for the calendar quarter ended september 30, 2016; therefore, these notes are convertible by the holders for the calendar quarter ending december 31, 2016. the following table summarizes the potential settlements that we could be required to make for the calendar quarter ending december 31, 2016 if all holders converted their 2032 notes and 2033 notes. the amounts in the table below are based on our closing share price of $16.64 as of september 1, 2016.

(1)   amounts include mmj creditor installment payments, convertible notes, and other notes. any future redemptions, repurchases, or conversions of debt could impact the amount and timing of our cash payments.
(3)   amounts include contractually obligated minimum lease payments for operating leases having an initial noncancelable term in excess of one year. additionally, amounts include a portion of the expected costs which meet the criteria of a minimum operating lease payment under our inotera supply agreement.
(4) purchase obligations include all commitments to purchase goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity that meet any of the following criteria: (1) they are noncancelable, (2) we would incur a penalty if the agreement was canceled, or (3) we must make specified minimum payments even if we do not take delivery of the contracted products or services ("take-or-pay"). if the obligation to purchase goods or services is noncancelable, the entire value of the contract was included in the above table. if the obligation is cancelable, but we would incur a penalty if canceled, the dollar amount of the penalty was included as a purchase obligation. contracted minimum amounts specified in take-or-pay contracts are also included in the above table as they represent the portion of each contract that is a firm commitment.
(5) amounts represent future cash payments to satisfy other long-term liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, including $349 million for the current portion of these long-term liabilities. we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future certain payments related to uncertain tax positions and deferred tax liabilities; therefore, the amount has been excluded from the preceding table. however, other noncurrent liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet included these uncertain tax positions and deferred tax liabilities.
the expected timing of payment amounts of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information. timing and actual amounts paid may differ depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services, market prices, changes to agreed-upon amounts, or timing of certain events for some obligations. the contractual obligations in the table above include the current portions of the related long-term obligations. all other current liabilities are excluded.
off-balance sheet arrangements we have entered into capped calls, which are intended to reduce the effect of potential dilution from our convertible notes.  the capped calls provide for our receipt of cash or shares, at our election, from our counterparties if the trading price of our stock is above a specified initial strike price at the expiration dates. the amounts receivable vary based on the trading price of our stock, up to specified cap prices. the dollar value of the cash or shares that we would receive from the capped calls on their expiration dates ranges from $0 if the trading price of our stock is below the initial strike price for all of the capped calls to $719 million if the trading price of our stock is at or above the cap price for all of the capped calls. we paid $103 million in 2012, and $48 million in 2013 to purchase capped calls. the amounts paid were recorded as charges to additional capital. for further details of our capped call arrangements, see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - equity - micron shareholders' equity - outstanding capped calls."
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures.  estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, forecasted events, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.  estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions.  we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis.  our management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments.
business acquisitions: accounting for acquisitions requires us to estimate the fair value of consideration paid and the individual assets and liabilities acquired, which involves a number of judgments, assumptions, and estimates that could materially affect the amount and timing of costs recognized.  accounting for acquisitions can also involve significant judgment to determine when control of the acquired entity is transferred. we typically obtain independent third party valuation studies to assist in determining fair values, including assistance in determining future cash flows, appropriate discount rates, and comparable market values. the items involving the most significant assumptions, estimates, and judgments include the following:
•   property, plant, and equipment, including determination of values in a continued-use model;
•   deferred tax assets, including projections of future taxable income and tax rates;
•   inventory, including estimated future selling prices, timing of product sales, and completion costs for work in process;
•   intangible assets, including valuation methodology, estimations of future revenue and costs, profit allocation rates attributable to the acquired technology, and discount rates; and
•   previously held equity interest, including discount rate and projections of future cash flows.
consolidations: we have interests in entities that are vies. determining whether to consolidate a vie requires judgment in assessing whether an entity is a vie and if we are the entity's primary beneficiary.  if we are the primary beneficiary of a vie, we are required to consolidate it. to determine if we are the primary beneficiary, we evaluate whether we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vie's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie. our evaluation includes identification of significant activities and an assessment of our ability to direct those activities based on governance provisions and arrangements to provide or receive product and process technology, product supply, operations services, equity funding, financing, and other applicable agreements and circumstances. our assessments of whether we are the primary beneficiary of our vies require significant assumptions and judgments.
contingencies: we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies.  considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of a loss, if any, from such contingencies.  an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.  we accrue a liability and charge operations for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date. in accounting for the resolution of contingencies, considerable judgment may be necessary to estimate amounts pertaining to periods prior to the resolution that are charged to operations in the period of resolution, and amounts related to future periods.
goodwill and intangible assets: we test goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently if indicators of an impairment exist, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit with goodwill is less than its carrying value. for reporting units in which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value, goodwill is considered not impaired and we are not required to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. for reporting units in which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is below the carrying value, then goodwill is tested for impairment using a two-step process. in the first step, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the unit. if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered not impaired. if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the second step of the impairment test must be performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. determining the implied fair value of goodwill requires valuation of all of the reporting unit's tangible and intangible assets and liabilities. if the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value.
determining when to test for impairment, the reporting units, the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, and the fair value of the reporting unit requires judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates, forecasted manufacturing costs, and other expenses and are developed as part of our routine long-range planning process. the same estimates are used in business planning, forecasting, and capital budgeting as part of our long-term manufacturing capacity analysis. we test the reasonableness of the output of our long-range planning process by calculating an implied value per share and comparing that to current stock prices, analysts' consensus pricing, and management's expectations. these estimates and assumptions are used to calculate projected future cash flows for the reporting unit, which are discounted using a risk-adjusted rate to calculate a fair value. the discount rate requires determination of appropriate market comparables. we base fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. actual future results may differ from those estimates.
we test other identified intangible assets with definite useful lives when events and circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable by comparing the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. we test intangible assets with indefinite lives annually for impairment using a fair value method such as discounted cash flows. estimating fair values involves significant assumptions, especially regarding future sales prices, sales volumes, costs, and discount rates.
income taxes: we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world.  these estimates involve judgment and interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex.  resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year.  we are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with u.s. gaap, which requires the assessment of our performance and other relevant factors.  realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income. in recent periods, our results of operations have benefitted from increases in the amount of deferred taxes we expect to realize, primarily from the levels of capital spending and increases in the amount of taxable income we expect to realize in japan and taiwan. our income tax provision or benefit is dependent, in part, on our ability to forecast future taxable income in these and other jurisdictions. such forecasts are inherently difficult and involve numerous judgments including, among others, projecting future average selling prices and sales volumes, manufacturing and overhead costs, levels of capital spending, and other factors that significantly impact our analyses of the amount of net deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized.
inventories: inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value.  cost includes depreciation, labor, material, and overhead costs, including product and process technology costs.  determining net realizable value of inventories involves numerous judgments, including projecting future average selling prices, sales volumes, and costs to complete products in work in process inventories.  to project average selling prices and sales volumes, we review recent sales volumes, existing customer orders, current contract prices, industry analyses of supply and demand, seasonal factors, general economic trends, and other information.  when these analyses reflect estimated net realizable value below our manufacturing costs, we record a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when the inventory is actually sold.  differences in forecasted average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of product inventories and accordingly the amount of write-down recorded.  for example, a 5% variance in the estimated selling prices would have changed the estimated net realizable value of our memory inventory by approximately $234 million as of september 1, 2016.  due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory industry, actual selling prices and volumes often vary significantly from projected prices and volumes; as a result, the timing of when product costs are charged to operations can vary significantly.
u.s. gaap provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to net realizable values.  the amount of any inventory write-down can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories. in determining the lower of average cost or net realizable value, inventories are primarily categorized as memory (including dram, non-volatile, and other memory) based on the major characteristics of product type and markets. the major characteristics we consider in determining inventory categories are product type and markets.
property, plant, and equipment: we review the carrying value of property, plant, and equipment for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and/or disposition.  in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets.  the estimation of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require judgment by us, including, but not limited to, future use of the assets for our operations versus sale or disposal of the assets, future selling prices for our products and future production and sales volumes.  in addition, judgment is required in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performed.
we periodically assess the estimated useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. we revised the estimated useful lives of equipment in our dram wafer fabrication facilities from five to seven years in the fourth quarter of 2016. for 2016, the effect of the revision was not material. (see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - significant accounting policies.")
research and development: costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as r&d as incurred.  determining when product development is complete requires judgment by us.  we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability.  subsequent to product qualification, product costs are included in cost of goods sold.
stock-based compensation: stock-based compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense using the straight-line amortization method over the requisite service period.  for performance-based stock awards, the expense recognized is dependent on the probability of the performance measure being achieved.  we utilize forecasts of future performance to assess these probabilities and this assessment requires considerable judgment.
determining the appropriate fair-value model and calculating the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment, including estimating stock price volatility, expected option life, and forfeiture rates.  we develop these estimates based on historical data and market information which can change significantly over time.  a small change in the estimates used can result in a relatively large change in the estimated valuation.  we use the black-scholes option valuation model to value employee stock awards.  we estimate stock price volatility based on an average of historical volatility and the implied volatility derived from traded options on our stock.

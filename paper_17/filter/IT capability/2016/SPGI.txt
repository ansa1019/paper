item 1a. risk factors we are providing the following cautionary statements which identify all known material risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical and expected results.
we operate in the capital, commodities and commercial markets. the capital markets include asset managers, investment banks, commercial banks, insurance companies, exchanges, and issuers; the commodities markets include producers, traders and intermediaries within energy, metals, petrochemicals and agriculture; and the commercial markets include professionals and corporate executives within automotive, financial services, insurance and marketing / research information services. certain risk factors are applicable to certain of our individual segments while other risk factors are applicable company-wide.
exposure to litigation and government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
•   in the normal course of business, both in the united states and abroad, we and our subsidiaries are defendants in numerous legal proceedings and are often the subject of government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries, as discussed under item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, in this annual report on form 10-k and in note 13 - commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements under item 8, consolidated financial statements and supplementary data, in this annual report on form 10-k, and we face the risk that additional proceedings, investigations and inquiries will arise in the future.
•   many of these proceedings, investigations and inquiries relate to the ratings activity of s&amp;p global ratings brought by issuers and alleged purchasers of rated securities. in addition, various government and self-regulatory agencies frequently make inquiries and conduct investigations into our compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including those related to ratings activities and antitrust matters.
•   any of these proceedings, investigations or inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments, damages, fines, penalties or activity restrictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
•   in view of the uncertainty inherent in litigation and government and regulatory enforcement matters, we cannot predict the eventual outcome of the matters we are currently facing or the timing of their resolution, or in most cases reasonably estimate what the eventual judgments, damages, fines, penalties or impact of activity restrictions may be. as a result, we cannot provide assurance that the outcome of the matters we are currently facing or that we may face in the future will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
•   as litigation or the process to resolve pending matters progresses, as the case may be, we continuously review the latest information available and assess our ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business and competitive position, which may require that we record liabilities in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.
•   legal proceedings impose additional expenses on the company and require the attention of senior management to an extent that may significantly reduce their ability to devote time addressing other business issues.
•   risks relating to legal proceedings may be heightened in foreign jurisdictions that lack the legal protections or liability standards comparable to those that exist in the united states. in addition, new laws and regulations have been and may continue to be enacted that establish lower liability standards, shift the burden of proof or relax pleading requirements, thereby increasing the risk of successful litigations against the company in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions. these litigation risks are often difficult to assess or quantify and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
•   we may not have adequate insurance or reserves to cover these risks, and the existence and magnitude of these risks often remains unknown for substantial periods of time and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
our acquisitions and other strategic transactions may not produce anticipated results.
•   we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions or enter into other strategic transactions to strengthen our business and grow our company. such transactions present significant challenges and risks.
•   the market for acquisition targets and other strategic transactions is highly competitive, especially in light of industry consolidation, which may affect our ability to complete such transactions.
•   if we are unsuccessful in completing such transactions or if such opportunities for expansion do not arise, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
•   if such transactions are completed, the anticipated growth and other strategic objectives of such transactions may not be fully realized, and a variety of factors may adversely affect any anticipated benefits from such transactions. for instance, the process of integration may require more resources than anticipated, we may assume unintended liabilities, there may be unexpected regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures, we may fail to retain key personnel of the acquired business and such transactions may divert management's focus from other business operations.
•   the anticipated benefits from an acquisition or other strategic transaction may not be realized fully, or may take longer to realize than expected. as a result, the failure of acquisitions and other strategic transactions to perform as expected could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
changes in the volume of securities issued and traded in domestic and/or global capital markets, asset levels and flows into investment products, changes in interest rates and volatility in the financial markets, and volatility in the commodities markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
•   our business is impacted by general economic conditions and volatility in the united states and world financial markets. therefore, since a significant component of our credit-rating based revenue is transaction-based, and is essentially dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets, unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers' willingness or ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuances for which ratings provides credit ratings.
•   our indices business is impacted by market volatility, asset levels of investment products tracking indices, and trading volumes of certain exchange traded derivatives. a decrease in our revenues attributable to these products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. volatile capital markets, as well as changing investment styles, among other factors, may influence an investor's decision to invest in and maintain an investment in an index-linked investment product.
•   increases in interest rates or credit spreads, volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment, significant political or economic events, defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance, the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers, the level of derivatives trading and/or the types of credit-sensitive products being offered, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
•   our platts business is impacted by volatility in the commodities markets. weak economic conditions, especially in our key markets, including the energy industry, could reduce demand for our products, impacting our revenues and margins. as a result of volatility in commodity prices and trading activity in physical commodities and commodities derivatives, we may encounter difficulty in achieving sustained market acceptance of past or future contract terms, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
•   any weakness in the macroeconomic environment could constrain customer budgets across the markets we serve, potentially leading to a reduction in their employee headcount and a decrease in demand for our subscription-based products.
increasing regulation of our ratings business in the united states, europe and elsewhere can increase our costs of doing business and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
•   the financial services industry is highly regulated, rapidly evolving and subject to the potential for increasing regulation in the united states, europe and elsewhere. the businesses conducted by ratings are in certain cases regulated under the credit rating agency reform act of 2006 (the "reform act"), the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act (the "dodd-frank act"), the u.s. securities exchange act of 1934 (the "exchange act"), and/or the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which they conduct business.
•   in the past several years, the u.s. congress, the international organization of securities commissions ("iosco"), the sec and the european commission, including through the european securities market authority ("esma"), as well as regulators in other countries in which ratings operates, have been reviewing the role of rating agencies and their processes and the need for greater oversight or regulations concerning the issuance of credit ratings or the activities of credit rating agencies. other laws, regulations and rules relating to credit rating agencies are being considered by local, national and multinational bodies and are likely to continue to be considered in the future, including provisions seeking to reduce regulatory and investor reliance on credit ratings, rotation of credit rating agencies and liability standards applicable to credit rating agencies.
•   these laws and regulations, and any future rulemaking, could result in reduced demand for credit ratings and increased costs, which we may be unable to pass through to customers. in addition, there may be uncertainty over the scope, interpretation and administration of such laws and regulations. we may be required to incur significant expenses in order to comply with such laws and regulations and to mitigate the risk of fines, penalties or other sanctions. legal proceedings could become increasingly lengthy and there may be uncertainty over and exposure to liability. it is difficult to accurately assess the future impact of legislative and regulatory requirements on our business and our customers' businesses, and they may affect ratings' communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process, alter the manner in which ratings' ratings are developed, affect the manner in which ratings or its customers or users of credit ratings operate, impact the demand for ratings and alter the economics of the credit ratings business. each of these developments increases the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and may have a material adverse effect on our operations, profitability and competitiveness, the demand for credit ratings and the manner in which such ratings are utilized.
•   additional information regarding rating agencies is provided under item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, in this annual report on form 10-k.
our indices and market and commodities intelligence businesses are subject to the potential for increased or changing regulation in the united states, europe and elsewhere, which can increase our costs of doing business globally and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
•   in addition to the extensive and evolving u.s. laws and regulations, foreign jurisdictions, principally in europe, have taken measures to increase regulation of the financial services and commodities industries.
•   in october of 2012, iosco issued its principles for oil price reporting agencies ("pra principles"), which iosco states are intended to enhance the reliability of oil price assessments that are referenced in derivative contracts subject to regulation by iosco members. platts has taken steps to align its operations with the pra principles and, as recommended by iosco in its final report on the pra principles, has aligned to the pra principles for other commodities for which it publishes benchmarks.
•   in july of 2013, iosco issued its principles for financial benchmarks ("financial benchmark principles"), which are intended to promote the reliability of benchmark determinations, and address governance, benchmark quality and accountability mechanisms, including with regard to the indices published by indices. indices has taken steps to align its governance regime and operations with the financial benchmark principles and engaged an independent auditor to perform a reasonable assurance review of such alignment.
•   the financial benchmarks industry is subject to the new pending benchmark regulation in the european union (the "e.u. benchmark regulation") as well as potential increased regulation in other jurisdictions, including australia. the e.u. benchmark regulation was published on june 30, 2016 and included provisions applicable to indices and platts, which will become effective january 1, 2018. the e.u. benchmark regulation requires indices and platts in due course to obtain registration or authorization in connection with their respective benchmark activities in europe. this legislation will likely cause additional operating obligations but they are not expected to be material at this time, although the exact impact remains unclear.
•   the european union has recently finalized a package of legislative measures known as mifid ii ("mifid ii"), which revise and update the existing e.u. markets in financial instruments directive framework. mifid ii applies in full in all e.u. member states as of january 3, 2017. mifid ii includes provisions that, among other things: (i) impose new conditions and requirements on the licensing of benchmarks and provide for non-discriminatory access to exchanges and clearing houses; (ii) modify the categorization and treatment of certain classes of derivatives; (iii) expand the categories of trading venue that are subject to regulation; and (iv) provide for the mandatory trading of certain derivatives on exchanges (complementing the mandatory derivative clearing requirements in the e.u. market infrastructure regulation of 2011). although the mifid ii package is "framework" legislation (meaning that much of the detail of the rules will be set out in subordinate measures to be agreed upon in the period before 2017), it is possible that the introduction of these laws and rules could affect indices' and platts' abilities both to administer and license their indices and price assessments, respectively. mifid ii and the market abuse regulation ("mar") may impose additional regulatory burdens on market and commodities intelligence's activities in the european union, although the exact severity and cost are not yet known.
•   market and commodities intelligence operates regulated investment advisory businesses in the united states, the european union and malaysia. these and other market and commodities intelligence businesses may increasingly become subject to new or more stringent regulations that will increase the cost of doing business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
future legislation, regulatory reform or policy changes under the current u.s. administration could have a material effect on our business and results of operations.
•   there exists the potential for comprehensive tax reform in the united states that may significantly change the tax rules applicable to u.s. domiciled corporations. changes such as lower corporate tax rates, repatriation allowances, removal of the interest expense deduction, removal of the municipal bond tax exemption or the introduction of a border adjustment tax could impact the company as a u.s. taxpayer, as well as the demand for our products and services. at this time, we cannot assess what the overall effect of such potential legislation could be on our results of operations or cash flows.
•   other legislation, regulatory reform or policy changes under the current u.s. administration, such as financial services regulatory reform, u.s. oil deregulation, government-sponsored enterprise (gse) reform and increased infrastructure spending, could impact our business. at this time, we cannot predict the scope or nature of these changes or assess what the overall effect of such potential changes could be on our results of operations or cash flows.
regulatory changes and economic conditions leading up to and following the united kingdom's likely exit from the european union could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
•   following a referendum on june 23, 2016 in which voters in the united kingdom ("u.k.") approved an exit from the european union ("eu"), it is expected that the u.k. government will initiate a process to leave the eu (often referred to as brexit) and begin negotiating the terms of the u.k.'s future relationship with the eu.
•   any impact from brexit on the company will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade and other negotiations. in addition, brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations between the u.k and the eu as the u.k. determines which eu laws to replace or replicate and the eu determines how to treat regulated activities (e.g., the activities of credit rating agencies) originating in the u.k. our businesses are subject to increasing regulation of the financial services and commodities industries in europe. potential changes in eu regulation and/or additional regulation in the u.k. could cause additional operating obligations and increased costs for our businesses.
•   any of these effects of brexit, and others we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, business opportunities, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
we may become subject to liability based on the use of our products by our clients.
•   some of our products support the investment processes of our clients, which, in the aggregate, manage trillions of dollars of assets. use of our products as part of the investment process creates the risk that clients, or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients, may pursue claims against us for very significant dollar amounts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
•   any such claim, even if the outcome were to be ultimately favorable to us, would involve a significant commitment of our management, personnel, financial and other resources and could have a negative impact on our reputation. in addition, such claims and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
increased competition could result in a loss of market share or revenue.
•   the markets for credit ratings, financial research, investment and advisory services, market data, index-based products, and commodities price assessments and related news and information about these markets are intensely competitive. ratings, market and commodities intelligence and indices compete domestically and internationally on the basis of a number of factors, including the quality of its ratings, data, research and advisory services, client service, reputation, price, geographic scope, range of products and technological innovation.
•   while our businesses face competition from traditional content and analytics providers, we also face competition from non-traditional providers such as exchanges, asset managers, investment banks and technology-led companies that are adding content and analytics capabilities to their core businesses.
•   in addition, in some of the countries in which ratings competes, governments may provide financial or other support to locally-based rating agencies and may from time to time establish official credit rating agencies, credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers.
•   sustained downward pressure on oil and other commodities prices and trading activity in those markets could have a material adverse effect on the rate of growth of platts' revenue, including subscription and licensing fees.
introduction of new products, services or technologies could impact our profitability.
•   we operate in highly competitive markets that continue to change to adapt to customer needs. in order to maintain a competitive position, we must continue to invest in new offerings and new ways to deliver our products and services. these investments may not be profitable or may be less profitable than what we have experienced historically.
•   we could experience threats to our existing businesses from the rise of new competitors due to the rapidly changing environment in which we operate.
•   we rely on our information technology environment and certain critical databases, systems and applications to support key product and service offerings. we believe we have appropriate policies, processes and internal controls to ensure the stability of our information technology, provide security from unauthorized access to our systems and maintain business continuity, but our business could be subject to significant disruption and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by unanticipated system failures, data corruption or unauthorized access to our systems.
a significant increase in operating costs and expenses could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.
•   our major expenditures include employee compensation and capital investments.
•   we offer competitive salary and benefit packages in order to attract and retain the quality employees required to grow and expand our businesses. compensation costs are influenced by general economic factors, including those affecting the cost of health insurance and postretirement benefits, and any trends specific to the employee skill sets we require.
•   we make significant investments in information technology data centers and other technology initiatives and we cannot provide assurances that such investments will result in increased revenues.
•   although we believe we are prudent in our investment strategies and execution of our implementation plans, there is no assurance as to the ultimate recoverability of these investments.
increased availability of free or relatively inexpensive information sources may reduce demand for our products and have a could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
•   in recent years, more public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become available, particularly through the internet, and advances in public cloud computing and open source software may continue.
•   public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for our products and services. demand could also be reduced as a result of cost-cutting initiatives at certain companies and organizations. although we believe our products are enhanced by our analysis, tools and applications, our financial results may be adversely affected if our customers choose to use these public sources as a substitute for our products or services.
consolidation of customers as well as staffing levels across our customer base could impact our available markets and revenue growth.
•   our businesses have a customer base which is largely comprised of members from the corporate, financial services and commodities industries. the consolidation of customers resulting from mergers and acquisitions across these industries can result in reductions in the number of firms and workforce which can impact the size of our customer base.
•   our customers that strive to reduce their operating costs may seek to reduce their spending on our products and services. if a large number of smaller customers or a critical number of larger customers reduce their spending with us, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
•   alternatively, customers may use other strategies to reduce their overall spending on financial and commodity market products and services by consolidating their spending with fewer vendors, including by selecting other vendors with lower-cost offerings, or by self-sourcing their need for financial and commodity market products and services. if customers elect to consolidate their spending on financial and commodity market products and services with other vendors and not us, if we lose business to lower priced competitors, or if customers elect to self-source their product and service needs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
•   a material portion of our revenues in our indices business is concentrated in some of our largest customers, who have significant assets under management in index funds and exchange-traded funds. a loss of a substantial portion of revenue from our largest customers could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
if we lose key outside suppliers of data and products or if the data or products of these suppliers have errors or are delayed, we may not be able to provide our clients with the information and products they desire.
•   our ability to produce our products and develop new products is dependent upon the products of other suppliers, including certain data, software and service suppliers. some of our products are dependent upon (and of little value without) updates from our data suppliers and most of our information and data products are dependent upon (and of little value without) continuing access to historical and current data.
•   we utilize certain data provided by third-party data sources in a variety of ways, including large volumes of data from certain stock exchanges around the world.
•   if the data from our suppliers has errors, is delayed, has design defects, is unavailable on acceptable terms or is not available at all, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
•   some of our agreements with data suppliers allow them to cancel on short notice. termination of one or more of our significant data agreements or exclusion from, or restricted use of, or litigation in connection with, a data provider's information could decrease the available information for us to use (and offer our clients) and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
changes in the legislative, regulatory, and commercial environments in which we operate may materially and adversely impact our ability to collect, compile, use, and publish data and may impact our financial results.
•   certain types of information we collect, compile, use, and publish, including offerings in our market and commodities intelligence business, are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate. in addition, there is increasing concern among certain privacy advocates and government regulators regarding marketing and privacy matters, particularly as they relate to individual privacy interests.
•   these concerns may result in new or amended laws and regulations. future laws and regulations with respect to the collection, compilation, use, and publication of information and consumer privacy could result in limitations on our operations, increased compliance or litigation expense, adverse publicity, or loss of revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. it is also possible that we could be prohibited from collecting or disseminating certain types of data, which could affect our ability to meet our customers' needs.
our ability to protect our intellectual property rights could impact our competitive position.
•   our products contain intellectual property delivered through a variety of digital and other media. our ability to achieve anticipated results depends in part on our ability to defend our intellectual property against infringement. our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by inadequate or changing legal and technological protections for intellectual property and proprietary rights in some jurisdictions and markets.
•   our products also contain intellectual property of third party sources. any violation by us of the intellectual property rights of such third parties could result in litigation and reputational damage which materially and adversely affects our business, financial condition or results of operations.
we are exposed to multiple risks associated with the global nature of our operations.
•   the geographic breadth of our activities subjects us to significant legal, economic, operational, market, compliance and reputational risks. these include, among others, risks relating to:
▪   economic and political conditions around the world,
▪   fluctuation in interest rates and currency exchange rates,
▪   limitations that foreign governments may impose on the conversion of currency or the payment of dividends or other remittances to us from our non-u.s. subsidiaries,
▪   differing accounting principles and standards,
▪   unexpected increases in taxes or changes in u.s. or foreign tax laws,
▪   the costs of repatriating cash held by entities outside the united states, including withholding or other taxes that foreign governments may impose on the payment of dividends or other remittances to us from our non-u.s. subsidiaries,
▪   potential costs and difficulties in complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations (including tax systems) administered by foreign government agencies, some of which may conflict with u.s. or other sources of law,
▪   changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements,
▪   the possibility of nationalization, expropriation, price controls and other restrictive governmental actions,
▪   competition with local rating agencies that have greater familiarity, longer operating histories and/or support from local governments or other institutions,
▪   civil unrest, terrorism, unstable governments and legal systems, and other factors.
adverse developments in any of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
•   additionally, we are subject to complex u.s., european and other local laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations abroad, including trade sanctions laws, anti-corruption laws such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and the u.k. bribery act 2010, anti-bribery laws, anti-money laundering laws, and other financial crimes laws. although we have implemented internal controls, policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs to deter prohibited practices, such measures may not be effective in preventing employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies and violating applicable laws and regulations. any determination that we have violated trade sanctions, anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
•   compliance with international and u.s. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. violations of such laws and regulations may result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, administrative remedies, restrictions on business conduct and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business, financial condition or results of operations.
our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability.
•   should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood, terrorist attack, pandemic, security breach, cyber attack, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made disaster, our ability to continue to operate will depend, in part, on the availability of our personnel, our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations. in such an event, we could experience operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations, such as key executive officers or personnel, that could have a material adverse effect on our business.
•   we regularly assess and take steps to improve our existing business continuity plans and key management succession. however, a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions, or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem, could materially interrupt our business operations and result in material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships or legal liability.
outsourcing certain aspects of our business could result in disruption and increased costs.
•   we have outsourced certain support functions to third-party service providers to leverage leading specialized capabilities and achieve cost efficiencies. outsourcing these functions involves the risk that the third-party service providers may not perform to our standards or legal requirements, may not produce reliable results, may not perform in a timely manner, may not maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information, or may fail to perform at all. failure of these third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, confidentiality, or other obligations to us could result in material financial loss, higher costs, regulatory actions and reputational harm.
•   outsourcing these functions also involves the risk that the third-party service providers may not maintain adequate physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect the security of our confidential information and data. failure of these third parties to maintain these safeguards could result in unauthorized access to our systems or a system or network disruption that could lead to improper disclosure of confidential information or data, regulatory penalties and remedial costs.
we rely heavily on network systems and the internet and any failures or disruptions may adversely affect our ability to serve our customers.
•   many of our products and services are delivered electronically, and our customers rely on our ability to process transactions rapidly and deliver substantial quantities of data on computer-based networks. our customers also depend on the continued capacity, reliability and security of our electronic delivery systems, our websites and the internet.
•   our ability to deliver our products and services electronically may be impaired due to infrastructure or network failures, malicious or defective software, human error, natural disasters, service outages at third-party internet providers or increased government regulation.
•   delays in our ability to deliver our products and services electronically may harm our reputation and result in the loss of customers. in addition, a number of our customers entrust us with storing and securing their data and information on our servers.
•   although we have disaster recovery plans that include backup facilities for our primary data centers, our systems are not always fully redundant, and our disaster planning may not always be sufficient or effective. as such, these disruptions may affect our ability to store, handle and secure such data and information.
our operations and infrastructure may malfunction or fail, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
•   our ability to conduct business may be materially and adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which we are located, including new york city, the location of our headquarters, and major cities worldwide in which we have offices.
•   this may include a disruption involving physical or technological infrastructure used by us or third parties with or through whom we conduct business, whether due to human error, natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, acts of terrorism, political unrest, war or otherwise. our efforts to secure and plan for potential disruptions of our major operating systems may not be successful.
•   we also do not have fully redundant systems for most of our smaller office locations and low-risk systems, and our disaster recovery plan does not include restoration of non-essential services. if a disruption occurs in one of our locations or systems and our personnel in those locations or those who rely on such systems are unable to utilize other systems or communicate with or travel to other locations, such persons' ability to service and interact with our clients and customers may suffer.
•   we cannot predict with certainty all of the adverse effects that could result from our failure, or the failure of a third party, to efficiently address and resolve these delays and interruptions. a disruption to our operations or infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
we are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity and protection of confidential information.
•   our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential, sensitive and other types of data and information in our computer systems and networks and those of our third-party vendors.
•   all of our businesses have access to material non-public information concerning the company's customers, including sovereigns, corporate issuers and other third parties around the world, the unauthorized disclosure of which could affect the trading markets for such customers' securities and could damage such customers' competitive positions. the cyber risks the company faces range from cyber-attacks common to most industries, to more sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to certain information or systems due in part to our prominence in the global marketplace, such as our ratings on debt issued by sovereigns and corporate issuers, or the composition of our indices. unauthorized disclosure of this information could cause our customers to lose faith in our ability to protect their confidential information and therefore cause customers to cease doing business with us.
•   breaches of our or our vendors' systems and networks, whether from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service attacks or other cyber-attacks, hacking, computer viruses or malware, employee error, malfeasance, physical breaches or other actions, may cause material interruptions or malfunctions in our or such vendors' websites, applications or data processing, or may compromise the confidentiality and integrity of material information regarding us, our business or our customers.
•   misappropriation, improper modification, destruction, corruption or unavailability of our data and information due to cyber incidents, attacks or other security breaches could damage our brand and reputation, result in litigation and regulatory actions, and lead to loss of customer confidence in our security measures and reliability, which would harm our ability to retain customers and gain new ones.
•   although s&amp;p global and its affiliates devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update their systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to the enterprise and our customers, clients and employees, there is no assurance that all of our security measures will provide absolute security.
•   measures that we take to avoid or mitigate material incidents can be expensive, and may be insufficient, circumvented, or become obsolete. any material incidents could cause us to experience reputational harm, loss of customers, regulatory actions, sanctions or other statutory penalties, litigation or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us, and increased expenses related to addressing or mitigating the risks associated with any such material incidents.
•   cyber threats are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated. despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, as cyber threats evolve and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber threats might defeat the measures that we or our vendors take to anticipate, detect, avoid or mitigate such threats. certain techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, introduce malicious software, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems may be designed to remain dormant until a triggering event and we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures since techniques change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources.
•   if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and could result in damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services.
•   the theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment. costs to comply with and implement these privacy-related and data protection measures could be significant. in addition, if despite our best efforts an inadvertent failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations should occur, this could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others.
•   any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
inability to attract and retain key qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
•   the development, maintenance and support of our products and services are dependent upon the knowledge, experience and ability of our highly skilled, educated and trained employees. accordingly, our business is dependent on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees. if the company is less successful in its recruiting efforts, or if it is unable to retain key employees, its ability to develop and deliver successful products and services or achieve strategic goals may be adversely affected.
our brand and reputation are key assets and competitive advantages of our company and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace.
•   our ability to attract and retain customers is affected by external perceptions of our brand and reputation. negative perceptions or publicity could damage our reputation with customers, prospects and the public generally, which could negatively impact, among other things, our ability to attract and retain customers, employees and suppliers, as well as suitable candidates for acquisition or other combinations.

(together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the "company," "we," "us" or "our") for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the md&a should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2016, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. ("u.s. gaap").

•   liquidity and capital resources
•   reconciliation of non-gaap financial information
•   critical accounting estimates
•   recent accounting standards certain of the statements below are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. in addition, any projections of future results of operations and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. see forward-looking statements on page 4 of this report.
overview we are a leading provider of transparent and independent ratings, benchmarks, analytics and data to the capital and commodity markets worldwide. the capital markets include asset managers, investment banks, commercial banks, insurance companies, exchanges, and issuers; and the commodity markets include producers, traders and intermediaries within energy, metals, petrochemicals and agriculture.
on april 27, 2016, we changed our name to s&p global inc. from mcgraw hill financial, inc.
we have repositioned s&p global as a more focused company in the capital and commodity markets by exiting non-core assets and investing for growth in markets that have size and scale. in 2016, we continued to create a portfolio focused on scalable, industry leading, interrelated businesses in the capital and commodity markets.
our operations consist of three reportable segments: ratings, market and commodities intelligence and s&p dow jones indices ("indices").
•   ratings is an independent provider of credit ratings, research and analytics, offering investors and other market participants information, ratings and benchmarks.
•   market and commodities intelligence is a global provider of multi-asset-class data, research and analytical capabilities, which integrate cross-asset analytics and desktop services and deliver their customers in the commodity and energy markets access to high-value information, data, analytic services and pricing and quality benchmarks. as of september 7, 2016, we completed the sale of j.d. power and the results are included in market and commodities intelligence results through that date.
•   indices is a global index provider that maintains a wide variety of valuation and index benchmarks for investment advisors, wealth managers and institutional investors.
effective beginning with the fourth quarter of 2016, we realigned certain of our reportable segments to be consistent with changes to our organizational structure and how our chief executive officer evaluates the performance of these segments. beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, s&p global market intelligence and s&p global platts are included in a new reportable segment named market and commodities intelligence. our historical segment reporting has been retroactively revised to reflect the current organizational structure.
major portfolio changes the following significant changes by segment were made to our portfolio during the three years ended december 31, 2016:
market and commodities intelligence
•   in october of 2016, we completed the sale of standard &amp; poor's securities evaluations, inc. ("spse") and credit market analysis ("cma") for $425 million in cash to intercontinental exchange, an operator of global exchanges, clearing houses and data services. during year ended december 31, 2016, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $364 million ($297 million after-tax) in (gain) loss on dispositions in the consolidated statement of income related to the sale of spse and cma.
•   in september of 2016, we completed the sale of j.d. power for $1.1 billion to xio group, a global alternative investments firm headquartered in london. in the fourth quarter of 2015, we began exploring strategic alternatives for j.d. power and initiated an active program to sell the business. the assets and liabilities of j.d. power were classified as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2015. during the year ended december 31, 2016, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $728 million ($516 million after-tax) in (gain) loss on dispositions in the consolidated statement of income related to the sale of j.d. power. following the sale, the assets and liabilities of j.d. power are no longer reported in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2016.

market and commodities intelligence
•   in september of 2015, we acquired snl financial lc ("snl") for $2.2 billion. snl is a global provider of news, data, and analytical tools to five sectors in the global economy: financial services, real estate, energy, media &amp; communications, and metals &amp; mining. snl delivers information through its suite of web, mobile and direct data feed platforms that helps clients, including investment and commercial banks, investors, corporations, and regulators make decisions, improve efficiency, and manage risk.

market and commodities intelligence

2   2016 includes a $1.1 billion gain from our dispositions, a benefit related to net legal settlement insurance recoveries of $10 million, disposition-related costs of $48 million, a technology-related impairment charge of $24 million, restructuring charges of $6 million, a $3 million disposition-related reserve release and acquisition-related costs of $1 million. 2015 includes costs related to identified operating efficiencies primarily related to restructuring of $56 million, net legal settlement expenses of $54 million, acquisition-related costs of $37 million and a gain of $11 million on the sale of our interest in a legacy mcgraw hill construction investment. 2014 includes $1.6 billion of legal and regulatory settlements, restructuring charges of $86 million and $4 million of professional fees largely related to corporate development activities. 2016, 2015 and 2014 also includes amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $96 million, $67 million and $48 million, respectively.
revenue increased 7% driven by increases at all of our reportable segments. revenue growth at market and commodities intelligence was favorably impacted by the acquisition of snl in september of 2015 and annualized contract value growth primarily driven by the s&p capital iq desktop, global risk services and certain data feed products. continued demand for s&p global platts' proprietary content also contributed to revenue growth. these increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact from our dispositions in 2016. revenue growth at ratings was driven by an increase in u.s. bank loan ratings revenue, corporate bond ratings revenue and surveillance fees. revenue growth at indices was due to higher average levels of assets under management for exchange traded funds ("etfs") and mutual funds, an increase in data revenue and higher volumes for exchange-traded derivatives. the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange reduced revenue by less than 1 percentage point.
operating profit increased 76%. excluding the favorable impact of the gain from our dispositions of 59 percentage points, higher net legal settlement insurance recoveries in 2016 of 3 percentage points, higher restructuring charges in 2015 of 3 percentage points and higher acquisition-related costs in 2015 of 2 percentage points, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of higher disposition-related costs of 3 percentage points, higher amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of 2 percentage points and a technology-related impairment charge of 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 15%. this increase was primarily driven by revenue growth as discussed above. decreased costs at ratings and our legacy capital iq business due to reduced headcount following our 2015 restructuring actions also contributed to operating profit growth.
revenue increased 5% driven by increases at market and commodities intelligence and indices, partially offset by a decrease at ratings. revenue growth at market and commodities intelligence was favorably impacted by the acquisition of snl in september of 2015 and the acquisition of national automobile dealers association's used car guide ("ucg") at j.d. power in july of 2015. the revenue increase at market and commodities intelligence was also driven by increases in average contract values in the s&p capital iq desktop and global risk services products, continued demand for s&p global platts' proprietary content and an increase in auto consulting engagements in the u.s. at j.d. power. revenue growth at indices was due to higher average levels of assets under management for etfs and mutual funds and higher volumes for exchange-traded derivatives. the revenue decrease at ratings was driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by 2 percentage points which was offset by the favorable impact from acquisitions of 2 percentage points.
the increase in operating profit was primarily due to the impact of $1.6 billion in legal and regulatory settlements in 2014 compared to net legal settlement expenses of $54 million in 2015. in addition, 2015 includes costs related to identified operating efficiencies primarily related to restructuring of $56 million in 2015 compared to $86 million in 2014. 2015 also includes acquisition-related costs related to the acquisition of snl of $37 million and an $11 million gain on the sale of our interest in a legacy mcgraw hill construction investment. 2014 includes $4 million of professional fees largely related to corporate development activities. excluding these items, operating profit increased 13%. this increase was driven by revenue growth at market and commodities intelligence and indices and cost containment efforts at ratings during 2015.
outlook we are a leading provider of transparent and independent ratings, benchmarks, analytics and data to the capital and commodity markets worldwide. our purpose is to provide the intelligence that is essential for companies, governments and individuals to make decisions with conviction. we seek to deliver on this purpose within the framework of our core values of integrity, excellence and relevance.
with the successful completion of our growth and performance plan, we are aligning our efforts against two key strategic priorities, growth and excellence. we strive to deliver on our strategic priorities in the following four categories by:
financial
•   delivering strong financial performance and long-term value to our shareholders.
•   engaging with the world around us;
•   investing to meet customer needs in high growth areas; and
•   expanding in international markets.
excellence
•   embracing operational excellence in all that we do; and
•   accelerating digital transformation and stimulating innovation.
•   enhancing leadership and accountability.
there can be no assurance that we will achieve success in implementing any one or more of these strategies as a variety of factors could unfavorably impact operating results, including prolonged difficulties in the global credit markets and a change in the regulatory environment affecting our businesses. see item 1a, risk factors, in this annual report on form 10-k.

revenue increased 7% as compared to 2015. subscription / non-transaction revenue increased primarily from the favorable impact of the acquisition of snl in september of 2015, growth in average contract values for our legacy capital iq products driven by an expansion in new and existing accounts, continued demand for s&p global platts' proprietary content and an increase in surveillance fees at ratings. asset linked fees increased due to higher average levels of assets under management for etfs and mutual funds. non-subscription / transaction revenue decreased primarily due to the unfavorable impact of the sale of j.d. power on september 7, 2016, partially offset by an increase in u.s. bank loan ratings revenue and corporate bond ratings revenue at ratings and higher volumes for exchange traded derivatives at indices. see " - segment review" below for further information.
the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by less than 1 percentage point. this impact refers to constant currency comparisons estimated by recalculating current year results of foreign operations using the average exchange rate from the prior year.
revenue increased 5% as compared to 2014. subscription / non-transaction revenue increased primarily due to growth at market and commodities intelligence due to an increase in the average contract values in the s&p capital iq desktop and global risk services products as well as continued demand for s&p global platts' proprietary content. assets linked fees increased due to higher average levels of assets under management for etfs and mutual funds. non-subscription / transaction revenue increased primarily due to growth at indices due to higher volumes for exchange-traded derivatives, partially offset by a decrease at ratings which includes the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates. subscription / non-transaction revenue growth was also favorably impacted by the acquisitions of snl and ucg in september of 2015 and july of 2015, respectively. see " - segment review" below for further information.
the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by 2 percentage points. this impact refers to constant currency comparisons estimated by recalculating current year results of foreign operations using the average exchange rate from the prior year. the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue primarily related to ratings and was driven by the weakening of the euro to the u.s. dollar.

selling and general expenses selling and general expenses decreased 7%. excluding the favorable impact of higher net legal settlement insurance recoveries in 2016 of 4 percentage points, higher restructuring charges in 2015 of 3 percentage points, higher acquisition-related costs in 2015 of 2 percentage points, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of disposition-related costs of 3 percentage points and a technology-related impairment charge of 1 percentage point, selling and general expenses decreased 2%. decreases at ratings were driven by reduced professional fees following the completion of the company's program for the 2015 implementation of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and reduced legal fees following the resolution of a number of significant legal matters. this decrease was partially offset by an increase at market and commodities intelligence driven by the acquisition of snl in september of 2015, partially offset by decreases from our dispositions in 2016.
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased $24 million or 15% as compared to 2015 primarily due to higher intangible asset amortization in 2016 from the acquisition of snl in september of 2015.

operating-related expenses operating-related expenses increased $49 million or 3% as compared to 2014. increases at market and commodities intelligence were primarily driven by higher data processing costs, the acquisition of snl in september of 2015 and higher incentive costs. these increases were partially offset by declines at ratings driven by our compensation cost containment efforts resulting from 2014 restructuring actions.
selling and general expenses selling and general expenses decreased 51%. excluding the favorable net impact of legal settlement and regulatory settlement charges and insurance recoveries of 48 percentage points, higher costs recorded in 2014 related to identified operating efficiencies primarily related to restructuring of 1 percentage point, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of acquisition-related costs related to the acquisition of snl of 1 percentage point, selling and general expenses decreased 3%. the decline was due to a decrease at ratings driven by lower incentive and legal costs, partially offset by increased costs related to the 2015 implementation of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and an increase at market and commodities intelligence driven by the acquisition of snl in september of 2015.
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased $23 million or 17% as compared to 2014, primarily due to higher intangible asset amortization in 2015 due to the acquisition of snl in september of 2015 and the acquisition of ucg in july of 2015.

during 2014, we completed the following transactions that resulted in a pre-tax loss of $9 million in (gain) loss on dispositions in the consolidated statement of income:
•   on july 31, 2014, we completed the sale of the company's aircraft to harold w. mcgraw iii, then chairman of the company's board of directors and former president and ceo of the company ("mr. mcgraw") for a purchase price of $20 million, which was modestly higher than the independent appraisal obtained. during the second quarter of 2014, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $6 million in (gain) loss on dispositions in our consolidated statement of income as a result of the pending sale. see note 14 - related party transactions to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
•   on june 30, 2014, we completed the sale of our data center to quality technology services, llc ("qts") which owns, operates, and manages data centers. net proceeds from the sale of $58 million were received in july of 2014. the sale includes all of the facilities and equipment on the south campus of our east windsor, new jersey location, inclusive of the rights and obligations associated with an adjoining solar power field. the sale resulted in an expense of $3 million recorded in (gain) loss on dispositions in our consolidated statement of income, which is in addition to the non-cash impairment charge we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013.
operating profit we consider operating profit to be an important measure for evaluating our operating performance and we evaluate operating profit for each of the reportable business segments in which we operate.
we internally manage our operations by reference to "segment operating profit" with economic resources allocated primarily based on segment operating profit. segment operating profit is defined as operating profit before unallocated expense. segment operating profit is one of the key metrics we use to evaluate operating performance. segment operating profit is not, however, a measure of financial performance under u.s. gaap, and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner.
effective beginning with the fourth quarter of 2016, we realigned certain of our reportable segments to be consistent with changes to our organizational structure and how our chief executive officer evaluates the performance of these segments. beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, s&p global market intelligence and s&p global platts are included in a new reportable segment named market and commodities intelligence. our historical segment reporting has been retroactively revised to reflect the current organizational structure.

1   2016 includes a benefit related to net legal settlement insurance recoveries of $10 million and restructuring charges of $6 million. 2015 includes net legal settlement expenses of $54 million and restructuring charges of $13 million. 2014 includes $1.6 billion of legal and regulatory settlements and restructuring charges of $45 million. 2016, 2015 and 2014 also includes amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $5 million, $5 million and $6 million, respectively.
2   2016 includes a $1.1 billion gain from our dispositions, disposition-related costs of $48 million, a technology-related impairment charge of $24 million and an acquisition-related cost of $1 million. 2015 includes acquisition-related costs related to the acquisition of snl of $37 million and costs identified operating efficiencies primarily related to restructuring of $33 million. 2014 includes $25 million of restructuring charges. 2016, 2015 and 2014 includes amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $85 million, $57 million and $37 million, respectively.
3   2014 includes the impact of professional fees largely related to corporate development activities of $4 million. 2016, 2015 and 2014 includes amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $6 million, $5 million and $5 million, respectively.
4   2016 includes $3 million from a disposition-related reserve release. 2015 includes a gain of $11 million related to the sale of our interest in a legacy mcgraw hill construction investment and costs related to identified operating efficiencies primarily related to restructuring of $10 million. 2014 includes restructuring charges of $16 million.
segment operating profit - increased $1.4 billion, or 70% as compared to 2015. excluding the favorable impact of the gain from our dispositions of 55 percentage points, higher net legal settlement insurance recoveries in 2016 of 3 percentage points, higher acquisition-related costs in 2015 of 2 percentage points, higher restructuring charges in 2015 of 2 percentage points, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a technology-related impairment charge of 1 percentage point, higher amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of 2 percentage points and higher disposition-related costs of 2 percentage points, segment operating profit increased 13%. revenue growth at market and commodities intelligence, ratings and indices were the primary drivers for the increase. decreased costs at ratings and our legacy capital iq business due to reduced headcount following our 2015 restructuring actions also contributed to segment operating profit growth. see " - segment review" below for further information.
unallocated expense - decreased by $11 million or 8% as compared to 2015. these expenses, included in selling and general expenses, mainly include costs for corporate center functions, select initiatives and unoccupied office space. excluding the unfavorable impact of a gain on the sale of our interest in a legacy mcgraw hill construction investment in 2015 of 8 percentage points, partially offset by the favorable impact of a disposition-related reserve release of 2 percentage points and higher restructuring charges in 2015 of 7 percentage points, unallocated expense decreased 7% due to higher 2016 pension income as well as a reduction in professional service fees.
foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact on operating profit of 2 percentage points. the foreign exchange rate impact refers to constant currency comparisons and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities. constant currency impacts are estimated by recalculating current year results of foreign operations using the average exchange rate from the prior year. remeasurement impacts are based on the variance between current-year and prior-year foreign exchange rate fluctuations on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the individual business' functional currency.
segment operating profit - increased $1.8 billion, or 629% as compared to 2014. 2015 includes net legal settlement charges of $54 million compared to legal and regulatory settlement charges of $1.6 billion in 2014. excluding the favorable impact of lower net legal and regulatory settlement charges of 621 percentage points, higher costs recorded in 2014 related to identified operating efficiencies primarily related to restructuring of 9 percentage points and the impact of professional fees largely related to corporate development activities recorded in 2014 of 2 percentage points, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of acquisition-related costs related to the acquisition of snl of 15 percentage points, segment operating profit increased 11%. revenue growth at market and commodities intelligence and indices, and cost containment efforts at ratings during 2015 were the primary drivers for the increase. see " - segment review" below for further information.
unallocated expense - decreased by $31 million or 18% as compared to 2014. these expenses, included in selling and general expenses, mainly include costs for corporate center functions, select initiatives and unoccupied office space. excluding the favorable impact of the sale of our interest in a legacy mcgraw hill construction investment of 6 percentage points and higher costs recorded in 2014 related to identified operating efficiencies primarily related to restructuring of 4 percentage points, unallocated expense decreased by 9 percentage points as compared to 2014. this decrease was primarily driven by the impact of a $9 million loss recorded in the second quarter of 2014 related to the sale of the company's aircraft and the sale of our data center.
foreign currency exchange rates had a negligible impact on operating profit. the foreign exchange rate impact refers to constant currency comparisons and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities. constant currency impacts are estimated by recalculating current year results of foreign operations using the average exchange rate from the prior year. remeasurement impacts are based on the variance between current-year and prior-year foreign exchange rate fluctuations on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the individual business' functional currency.
interest expense, net net interest expense for 2016 increased $79 million or 77% as compared to 2015, primarily as a result of the $700 million of senior notes issued in the second quarter of 2015, the $2.0 billion of senior notes issued in the third quarter of 2015 and the $500 million of senior notes issued in the third quarter of 2016. additionally, net interest expense in 2016 includes a redemption fee on the early payment of our 5.9% senior notes due in 2017. these increases were partially offset by the favorable impact of lower interest rates on the $500 million of senior notes issued in the third quarter of 2016.
net interest expense for 2015 increased 73% compared to 2014 as a result of the $700 million of senior notes issued in the second quarter of 2015 and the $2.0 billion of senior notes issued in the third quarter of 2015.
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate from continuing operations was 30.1% for 2016 and 2015, and 453.7% for 2014. the decrease in the 2015 effective tax rate was primarily due to the reduction in charges for legal settlements, improved profitability in several lower tax jurisdictions outside of the united states, and continuing resolution of prior year tax audits.
segment review ratings ratings is an independent provider of credit ratings, research and analytics to investors, issuers and other market participants. credit ratings are one of several tools investors can use when making decisions about purchasing bonds and other fixed income investments. they are opinions about credit risk and our ratings express our opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer, such as a corporation or state or city government, to meet its financial obligations in full and on time. our credit ratings can also relate to the credit quality of an individual debt issue, such as a corporate or municipal bond, and the relative likelihood that the issue may default.
ratings differentiates its revenue between transaction and non-transaction. transaction revenue primarily includes fees associated with:
•   corporate credit estimates, which are intended, based on an abbreviated analysis, to provide an indication of our opinion regarding creditworthiness of a company which does not currently have a ratings credit rating.
non-transaction revenue primarily includes fees for surveillance of a credit rating, annual fees for customer relationship-based pricing programs, fees for entity credit ratings and global research and analytics. non-transaction revenue also includes an intersegment royalty charged to market and commodities intelligence for the rights to use and distribute content and data developed by ratings. royalty revenue for 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $92 million, $83 million and $77 million, respectively.

revenue increased 4%, which includes the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates that reduced revenue by 1 percentage point. transaction revenue increased due to growth in u.s. bank loan ratings revenue and an increase in corporate bond ratings revenue largely driven by refinancing activity from the low interest rate environment, partially offset by a decrease in structured finance revenue. revenue growth benefited from increased contract realization. non-transaction revenue grew primarily due to an increase in surveillance fees, partially offset by a decline in ratings evaluation service ("res") activity.
operating profit increased 17%. excluding the favorable impact of higher net legal settlement insurance recoveries in 2016 of 6 percentage points and lower restructuring charges in 2016 of 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 10%. the increase is due to both revenue growth and expense reduction. reduced expenses were primarily driven by reduced professional fees following the completion of the company's program for the 2015 implementation of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and reduced legal fees following the resolution of a number of significant legal matters. these decreases were partially offset by higher compensation costs related to increased incentive costs and additional headcount. foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact on operating profit of 1 percentage point.
revenue decreased 1%, which includes the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates that reduced revenue by 4 percentage points. excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, transaction revenue increased primarily due to an increase in u.s. public finance issuance, partially offset by a decline in structured finance revenue driven by reduced global market issuance.
excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, non-transaction revenue also increased due to growth in surveillance revenues and additional res activity, partially offset by lower revenue associated with new client relationships.
operating profit increased 285%. excluding the favorable net impact of legal and regulatory settlement charges and insurance recoveries of 273 percentage points and net higher restructuring costs recorded in 2014 of 6 percentage points, operating profit increased 7%. foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point on the operating profit growth of 7%. this increase was driven by decreased compensation costs primarily driven by lower incentive costs and cost containment resulting from 2014 restructuring actions and reduced legal fees following the resolution of a number of significant legal matters, partially offset by increased costs related to the 2015 implementation of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and the decrease in revenue discussed above.
market issuance volumes we monitor market issuance volumes as an indicator of trends in transaction revenue streams within ratings. market issuance volumes noted within the discussion that follows are based on the domicile of the issuer. issuance volumes can be reported in two ways: by "domicile", which is based on where an issuer is located or where the assets associated with an issue are located, or based on "marketplace", which is where the bonds are sold. the following tables depict changes in market issuance levels as compared to the prior year, based on a composite of thomson financial, harrison scott publications, dealogic and rating's internal estimates.
investment grade                              (5)%              8%             11%
•   decreases in high-yield issuance in the year-to-date period reflect weakness in the first half of the year due to market volatility and political and economic uncertainty in the european markets. high-yield issuance in the u.s. and europe was up for the second half of the year as a result of more favorable market conditions primarily due to tightening credit spreads. although the number of investment-grade issuances in the u.s. was up, issuance dollars declined due to fewer high par value issuance deals.
structured finance                                 u.s.          europe          global asset-backed securities ("abs")                      1%             14%              7%

* represents no activity in 2016 and 2015.
•   abs issuance was up in the u.s. and europe driven by an increase in credit card transactions, consumer loans and small business loans.
•   issuance was down in the u.s. structured credit markets driven by lower availability of leveraged loans. issuance was up in the european structured credit markets driven by new collateralized loan obligations ("clo") engagements.
•   cmbs issuance in the u.s. and europe was down reflecting lower market volume due to overall market conditions.
•   rmbs volume in the u.s. was down driven by minimal activity in the private label securities market. the increase in european rmbs volume was driven by several large issuances in 2016.
•   covered bond (debt securities backed by mortgages or other high-quality assets that remain on the issuer's balance sheet) issuance in europe was down due to the impact of central bank lending policies.
industry highlights and outlook revenue increased in 2016 primarily due to an increase in u.s. bank loan ratings and corporate bond ratings revenue driven by refinancing activity from the low interest rate environment. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in structured finance revenue. high-yield corporate issuance volumes increased in the second half of the year as a result of more favorable market conditions primarily due to tightening credit spreads. weakness in high-yield corporate issuance volumes in the first half of the year was due to market volatility and political and economic uncertainty largely in the european markets.
legal and regulatory environment general ratings and many of the securities that it rates are subject to extensive regulation in both the u.s. and in other countries, and therefore existing and proposed laws and regulations can impact the company's operations and the markets in which it operates. additional laws and regulations have been adopted but not yet implemented or have been proposed or are being considered. in addition, in certain countries, governments may provide financial or other support to locally-based rating agencies. for example, governments may from time to time establish official rating agencies or credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers. we have reviewed the new laws, regulations and rules which have been adopted and we have implemented, or are planning to implement, changes as required. we do not believe that such new laws, regulations or rules will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. other laws, regulations and rules relating to credit rating agencies are being considered by local, national, foreign and multinational bodies and are likely to continue to be considered in the future, including provisions seeking to reduce regulatory and investor reliance on credit ratings, rotation of credit rating agencies and liability standards applicable to credit rating agencies. the impact on us of the adoption of any such laws, regulations or rules remains uncertain, but could increase the costs and legal risks relating to ratings' rating activities, or adversely affect our ability to compete, or result in changes in the demand for credit ratings.
in the normal course of business both in the u.s. and abroad, ratings (or the legal entities comprising ratings) are defendants in numerous legal proceedings and are often the subject of government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries. many of these proceedings, investigations and inquiries relate to the ratings activity of ratings and are or have been brought by purchasers of rated securities. in addition, various government and self-regulatory agencies frequently make inquiries and conduct investigations into ratings' compliance with applicable laws and regulations. any of these proceedings, investigations or inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments, damages, fines, penalties or activity restrictions, which could adversely impact our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business or competitive position.
the businesses conducted by our ratings segment are, in certain cases, regulated under the credit rating agency reform act of 2006 (the "reform act"), the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act (the "dodd frank act"), the securities exchange act of 1934 (the "exchange act") and/or the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which they conduct business. the financial services industry is subject to the potential for increased regulation in the u.s.
s&p global ratings is a credit rating agency that is registered with the sec as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization ("nrsro"). the sec first began informally designating nrsros in 1975 for use of their credit ratings in the determination of capital charges for registered brokers and dealers under the sec's net capital rule. the reform act created a new sec registration system for rating agencies that choose to register as nrsros. under the reform act, the sec is given authority and oversight of nrsros and can censure nrsros, revoke their registration or limit or suspend their registration in certain cases. the rules implemented by the sec pursuant to the reform act, the dodd frank act and the exchange act address, among other things, prevention or misuse of material non-public information, conflicts of interest, documentation and assessment of internal controls, and improving transparency of ratings performance and methodologies. the public portions of the current version of s&p global ratings' form nrsro are available on s&p global ratings' website.
european union in the european union, the credit rating industry is registered and supervised through a pan-european regulatory framework which is a compilation of three sets of legislative actions. in 2009, the european parliament passed a regulation ("cra1") that established an oversight regime for the credit rating industry in the european union, which became effective in 2010. cra1 requires the registration, formal regulation and periodic inspection of credit rating agencies operating in the european union. ratings was granted registration in october of 2011. in january of 2011, the european union established the european securities and markets authority ("esma"), which, among other things, has direct supervisory responsibility for the registered credit rating industry throughout the european union.
additional rules augmenting the supervisory framework for credit rating agencies went into effect in 2013. commonly referred to as cra3, these rules, among other things:
•   impose various additional procedural requirements with respect to ratings of sovereign issuers;
•   require member states to adopt laws imposing liability on credit rating agencies for an intentional or grossly negligent failure to abide by the applicable regulations;
•   impose mandatory rotation requirements on credit rating agencies hired by issuers of securities for ratings of resecuritizations, which may limit the number of years a credit rating agency can issue ratings for such securities of a particular issuer;
•   impose restrictions on credit rating agencies or their shareholders if certain ownership thresholds are crossed; and
•   impose additional procedural and substantive requirements on the pricing of services.
the financial services industry is subject to the potential for increased regulation in the european union.
other jurisdictions outside of the u.s. and the european union, regulators and government officials have also been implementing formal oversight of credit rating agencies. ratings is subject to regulations in most of the foreign jurisdictions in which it operates and continues to work closely with regulators globally to promote the global consistency of regulatory requirements. regulators in additional countries may introduce new regulations in the future.

effective beginning with the fourth quarter of 2016, we realigned certain of our reportable segments to be consistent with changes to our organizational structure and how our chief executive officer evaluates the performance of these segments. beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, s&p global market intelligence and s&p global platts are included in a new reportable segment named market and commodities intelligence. our historical segment reporting has been retroactively revised to reflect the current organizational structure.
in november of 2016, we entered into a put option agreement that gave the company the right, but not the obligation, to put the entire share capital of quant house sas ("quanthouse"), included in our market and commodities intelligence segment, to qh holdco, an independent third party. as a result, we classified the assets and liabilities of quanthouse, net of our costs to sell, as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2016 resulting in an aggregate loss of $31 million. on january 4, 2017, we exercised the put option, thereby entering into a definitive agreement to sell quanthouse to qh holdco. on january 9, 2017, we completed the sale of quanthouse to qh holdco.
in october of 2016, we completed the sale of equity research, a business within our market and commodities intelligence segment to cfra, a leading independent provider of forensic accounting research, analytics and advisory services. during the year ended december 31, 2016, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $9 million ($5 million after-tax) in (gain) loss on dispositions in the consolidated statement of income related to the sale of equity research.

in september of 2016, we completed the sale of j.d. power for $1.1 billion to xio group, a global alternative investments firm headquartered in london. in the fourth quarter of 2015, we began exploring strategic alternatives for j.d. power and initiated an active program to sell the business. the assets and liabilities of j.d. power were classified as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2015. during the year ended december 31, 2016, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $728 million ($516 million after-tax) in (gain) loss on dispositions in the consolidated statement of income related to the sale of j.d. power.
following the sale, the assets and liabilities of j.d. power are no longer reported in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2016.
on november 3, 2014, we completed the sale of mcgraw hill construction to symphony technology group for $320 million in cash. accordingly, the results of operations for the year ended december 31, 2014 and all prior periods presented were reclassified to reflect the business as a discontinued operation. see note 2 - acquisitions and divestitures for further discussion.

(in millions)                                                     year ended december 31,                                % change operating profit 1                $1,822                  $585                  $518              212       %          13       %
1   2016 includes a $1.1 billion gain from our dispositions, disposition-related costs of $48 million, a technology-related impairment charge of $24 million and an acquisition-related cost of $1 million. 2015 includes acquisition-related costs related to the acquisition of snl of $37 million and costs identified operating efficiencies primarily related to restructuring of $33 million. 2014 includes $25 million of restructuring charges. 2016, 2015 and 2014 includes amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $85 million, $57 million and $37 million, respectively.
revenue increased 9% and was favorably impacted by 1 percentage point of growth from the net impact of acquisitions and dispositions discussed below. revenue growth was also driven by increases in annualized contract values in the s&p capital iq desktop, ratingsxpress® and ratingsdirect® from new and existing customers. the number of users on the s&p capital iq desktop and the number of customers at ratingsxpress® continued to grow in 2016. increases in annualized contract value for certain of our data feed products also contributed to revenue growth. additionally, strength in s&p global platts' proprietary content due to continued demand for s&p global platts' market data and price assessment products across all commodity sectors, led by petroleum, and continued licensing of our proprietary market price data and price assessments to various commodity exchanges contributed to revenue growth. the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by less than 1 percentage point. both domestic and international revenue increased, with international revenue representing 41% of market and commodities intelligence's total revenue. revenue was favorably impacted by the acquisitions of snl, pira energy group ("pira"), rigdata and petromedia ltd, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the dispositions of j.d. power, spse and cma and equity research. see note 2 - acquisitions and divestitures for further discussion.
operating profit increased 212%. excluding the favorable impact from the gain on dispositions of 194 percentage points, the favorable impact of higher acquisition-related costs in 2015 of 6 percentage points and higher restructuring charges in 2015 of 6 percentage points, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of higher disposition-related costs of 9 percentage points, higher amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of 5 percentage points and a technology-related impairment charge of 4 percentage points, operating profit increased 24%. this increase is due to revenue growth and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates of 5 percentage points, partially offset by higher compensation costs and increased technology costs primarily as a result of the acquisition of snl in september of 2015.
revenue increased 12% and was favorably impacted by 5 percentage points of growth from the impact of acquisitions discussed below. revenue growth was also driven by increases in annualized contract values in the s&p capital iq desktop, ratingsxpress® and ratingsdirect® from new and existing customers. the number of users on the s&p capital iq desktop and the number of customers at ratingsxpress® continued to grow in 2015. additionally, strength in s&p global platts' proprietary content due to continued demand for s&p global platts' market data and price assessment products across all commodity sectors, led by petroleum product offerings, and continued licensing of our proprietary market price data and price assessments to various commodity exchanges contributed to revenue growth. the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by less than 1 percentage point. revenue was favorably impacted by the acquisitions of snl, national automobile dealers association's used car guide ("ucg"), petromedia in july of 2015 and eclipse energy group as and its operating subsidiaries ("eclipse"). see note 2 - acquisitions and divestitures for further discussion.
operating profit increased 13%. excluding the unfavorable impact of acquisition-related costs related to the acquisition of snl of 6 percentage points, higher amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of 3 percentage points and higher costs recorded in 2015 related to identified operating efficiencies primarily related to restructuring of 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 23%. this increase is due to revenue growth and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates of 5 percentage points, partially offset by higher technology costs and increased compensation costs driven by additional headcount related to the acquisitions of snl and ucg.
industry highlights and outlook in 2016, market and commodities intelligence benefited from organic revenue growth and continued revenue and costs synergies resulting from progress on the integration of snl. in 2016, the segment completed the sale of j.d. power, and spse and cma, resulting in a portfolio focused on scalable, industry leading, interrelated businesses in the capital and commodity markets. additionally, in 2016, the segment completed the acquisitions of pira and rigdata to enhance market and commodities intelligence's energy analytical capabilities.
in 2017, market and commodities intelligence will seek to develop new products and deliver enhancements to existing content and analytical capabilities. the segment also expects to further expand its presence in selected markets and geographies to accelerate international growth. market and commodities intelligence will continue to focus on integrating and leveraging recent acquisitions to expand its analytical offerings.
legal and regulatory environment market intelligence the financial services industry is subject to the potential for increased regulation in the u.s. and abroad. market intelligence operates investment advisory businesses that are regulated in the u.s. under the u.s. investment advisers act of 1940 (the "investment advisers act") and/or the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which they conduct business.
market intelligence operates a business that is authorized and regulated in the united kingdom by the financial conduct authority (the "fca"). as such, this business is authorized to arrange and advise on investments, and is also entitled to exercise a passport right to provide specified cross border services into other european economic area ("eea") states, and is to the conditions under the e.u. markets in financial instruments directive ("mifid").
on october 4, 2016, s&p global completed the sale of standard & poor's securities evaluations, inc. (one of market intelligence's investment advisory businesses) to intercontinental exchange. on october 3, 2016 market intelligence completed the sale of substantially all of its equity research business by transferring the assets of the business to accounting research & analytics, llc ("cfra"). on september 7, 2016 market intelligence entered into a stock purchase agreement with cfra to sell and transfer its entire ownership in standard & poor's malaysia sdn. bhd (s&p malaysia) and its research business. until the completion of this transaction, market intelligence will continue to operate the equity research business conducted by s&p malaysia.
the markets for research and investment advisory services are very competitive. market intelligence competes domestically and internationally on the basis of a number of factors, including the quality of its research and advisory services, client service, reputation, price, geographic scope, range of products and services, and technological innovation. for a further discussion of competitive and other risks inherent in our market intelligence business, see item 1a, risk factors, in this annual report on form 10-k.
s&p global platts s&p global platts' commodities price assessment and information business is subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny in the u.s. and abroad. as discussed below under the heading "indices-legal and regulatory environment", the financial benchmarks industry is subject to the new pending benchmark regulation in the european union (the "e.u. benchmark regulation") as well as potential increased regulation in other jurisdictions. as a result of these measures, as well as measures that could be taken in other jurisdictions outside of europe, s&p global platts will be required in due course to obtain registration or authorization in connection with its benchmark and price assessment activities in europe and potentially elsewhere.
also as discussed above under the heading "indices-legal and regulatory environment", the european union has recently finalized a package of legislative measures known as mifid ii, which may also impact s&p global platts' business. although the mifid ii package is "framework" legislation, it is possible that the introduction of these laws and rules could affect s&p global platts' ability both to administer and license its price assessments.
in october of 2012, iosco issued its pra principles which set out principles, which are intended to enhance the reliability of oil price assessments referenced in derivative contracts subject to regulation by iosco members. s&p global platts has taken steps to align its operations with the pra principles and as recommended by iosco in its final report on the pra principles, has aligned to the pra principles for other commodities for which it publishes benchmarks.
the markets for commodities price assessments and information are very competitive. s&p global platts competes domestically and internationally on the basis of a number of factors, including the quality of its assessments and other information it provides to the commodities and related markets, client service, reputation, price, range of products and services (including geographic coverage) and technological innovation. furthermore, sustained downward pressure on oil and other commodities prices and trading activity in those markets could have a material adverse impact on the rate of growth of s&p global platts' revenue. for a further discussion of competitive and other risks inherent in our platts business, see item 1a, risk factors, in this annual report on form 10-k.
indices indices is a global index provider that maintains a wide variety of indices to meet an array of investor needs. indices' mission is to provide transparent benchmarks to help with decision making, collaborate with the financial community to create innovative products and provide investors with tools to monitor world markets.
indices primarily derives revenue from asset linked fees based on the s&p and dow jones indices and to a lesser extent generates subscription revenue and transaction revenue. specifically, indices generates revenue from the following sources:
•   investment vehicles - asset linked fees such as etfs and mutual funds, that are based on the s&amp;p dow jones indices' benchmarks and generate revenue through fees based on assets and underlying funds;
•   exchange traded derivatives - generate royalties based on trading volumes of derivatives contracts listed on various exchanges;
•   index-related licensing fees - fixed or variable annual and per-issue fees for over-the-counter derivatives and retail-structured products; and
•   data and customized index subscription fees - fees from supporting index fund management, portfolio analytics and research.

1   2014 includes $4 million of professional fees largely related to corporate development activities. 2016, 2015 and 2014 includes amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $6 million, $5 million and $5 million, respectively.
revenue at indices increased 7%, primarily driven by higher average levels of assets under management ("aum") for etfs and mutual funds, an increase in data revenue and higher volumes for exchange-traded derivatives. revenue growth was favorably impacted by less than one percentage point from the acquisition of trucost plc ("trucost") in october of 2016. see note 2 - acquisitions and divestitures for further discussion. ending aum for etfs increased 25% to $1.023 trillion and average aum for etfs increased 8% to $869 billion compared to 2015. higher average levels of aum for etfs contributed to revenue growth primarily driven by the flow of investment funds to the u.s. equity markets in the second half of the year. foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact on revenue of less than 1 percentage point.
operating profit grew 5%. revenue growth was partially offset by higher compensation costs primarily driven by additional headcount related to the acquisition of trucost plc, increased incentive costs and increased operating costs to support revenue growth and business initiatives at indices. foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact on operating profit of less than 1 percentage point.
revenue at indices increased 8%, primarily driven by higher average levels of aum for etfs and mutual funds. volumes for exchange-traded derivatives continued to increase for certain products which also contributed to revenue growth. additionally, the year-over-year revenue increase was slightly unfavorably impacted by the refinement of our process for estimating revenue for certain products that favorably impacted 2014 which caused a one-time revenue increase in the prior-year period. ending aum for etfs decreased 2% to $815 billion in 2015 from $832 billion in 2014, primarily due to the flow of investment funds to the developed international equity markets and the impact of lower equity prices. the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by 1 percentage point.
operating profit grew 13%. excluding the favorable impact of professional fees largely related to corporate development activities recorded in 2014 of 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 12%. this increase was primarily due to revenue growth as expenses remained relatively flat as a result of cost containment measures.
industry highlights and outlook indices continues to be the leading index provider for the etf market space. in 2016, higher average levels of aum for etfs contributed to revenue growth. additionally, data revenue and higher volumes for exchange-traded derivatives contributed to the increase in revenue.
in october of 2016, the segment completed the acquisition of trucost to build on it's current portfolio of environmental, social and governance solutions.
indices will continue to seek to expand index offerings through asset class expansion, new geographies, and investment strategies by remaining focused on:
•   organic growth initiatives focused on building out its index and service offering;
•   acquisitions to expand into adjacent markets;
•   strategic acquisitions/partnerships to accelerate strategic areas of growth; and
•   expanding relationships with global exchanges to expand geographic reach and gain access to regional data sets.
legal and regulatory environment the financial benchmarks industry is subject to the new pending benchmark regulation in the european union (the "e.u. benchmark regulation") as well as potential increased regulation in other jurisdictions.
the e.u. benchmark regulation was published june 30, 2016 and included provisions applicable to indices and platts, which will become effective january 1, 2018. the e.u. benchmark regulation requires indices and platts in due course to obtain registration or authorization in connection with their respective benchmark activities in europe. this legislation will likely cause additional operating obligations but they are not expected to be material at this time, although the exact impact remains unclear.
in addition, the european union has recently finalized a package of legislative measures known as mifid ii, which revise and update the existing e.u. markets in financial instruments directive framework. mifid ii applies in full in all e.u. member states as of january 3, 2017. mifid ii includes provisions that, among other things: (i) impose new conditions and requirements on the licensing of benchmarks and provide for non-discriminatory access to exchanges and clearing houses; (ii) modify the categorization and treatment of certain classes of derivatives; (iii) expand the categories of trading venue that are subject to regulation; and (iv) provide for the mandatory trading of certain derivatives on exchanges (complementing the mandatory derivative clearing requirements in the e.u. market infrastructure regulation of 2011). although the mifid ii package is "framework" legislation (meaning that much of the detail of the rules will be set out in subordinate measures to be agreed upon in the period before 2017), it is possible that the introduction of these laws and rules could affect indices' ability both to administer and license its indices.
in july of 2013, the international organization of securities commissions ("iosco") issued financial benchmark principles, intended to promote the reliability of benchmark determinations, and address governance, benchmark quality and accountability mechanisms, including with regard to the indices published by indices. even though the financial benchmark principles are not binding law, indices has taken steps to align its governance regime and operations with the financial benchmark principles and engaged an independent auditor to perform a reasonable assurance review of such alignment.
the markets for index providers are very competitive. indices competes domestically and internationally on the basis of a number of factors, including the quality of its benchmark indices, client service, reputation, price, range of products and services (including geographic coverage) and technological innovation. for a further discussion of competitive and other risks inherent in our indices business, see item 1a, risk factors, in this annual report on form 10-k.
liquidity and capital resources we continue to maintain a strong financial position. our primary source of funds for operations is cash from our businesses and our core businesses have been strong cash generators. in 2017, cash on hand, cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facility are expected to be sufficient to meet any additional operating and recurring cash needs into the foreseeable future. we use our cash for a variety of needs, including but not limited to: ongoing investments in our businesses, strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends, repayment of debt, capital expenditures and investment in our infrastructure.
cash flow overview cash and cash equivalents were $2.4 billion as of december 31, 2016, an increase of $0.9 billion as compared to december 31, 2015, and consisted of approximately 30% of domestic cash and 70% of cash held abroad. typically, cash held outside the u.s. is anticipated to be utilized to fund international operations or to be reinvested outside of the u.s., as a significant portion of our opportunities for growth in the coming years is expected to be abroad. in the event funds from international operations are needed to fund operations in the u.s., we would be required to accrue for and pay taxes in the u.s. to repatriate these funds.
net cash provided by (used for):
operating activities from continuing operations          $1,464                  $195                $1,209
investing activities from continuing operations           1,205                (2,525    )              (65    )
financing activities from continuing operations          (1,600    )            1,510                  (462    )
in 2016, free cash flow increased to $1.2 billion compared to $(48.0) million in 2015. the increase is primarily due to the increase in cash provided from operating activities as discussed below. free cash flow is a non-gaap financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and dividends and other payments paid to noncontrolling interests. capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects. see "reconciliation of non-gaap financial information" below for a reconciliation of cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable u.s. gaap financial measure, to free cash flow and free cash flow excluding certain items.
operating activities cash provided by operating activities increased $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion in 2016 compared to $195 million in 2015. the increase is mainly due to the payment of legal and regulatory settlements in 2015 of $1.6 billion, partially offset by higher income tax payments in 2016.
cash provided by operating activities decreased $1.0 billion to $195 million in 2015 compared to $1.2 billion in 2014. the decrease is mainly due to the payment of legal and regulatory settlements in 2015 of $1.6 billion.
investing activities our cash outflows from investing activities are primarily for acquisitions and capital expenditures, while cash inflows are primarily proceeds from dispositions.
cash provided by investing activities increased to $1.2 billion for 2016 as compared to cash used for investing activities of $2.5 billion in 2015. the increase is primarily due to proceeds from the sale of j.d. power of $1.1 billion in 2016 compared to cash used for the acquisition of snl of $2.2 billion in 2015.
cash used for investing activities increased to $2.5 billion for 2015 from $65 million in 2014, primarily due to the acquisition of snl in 2015.
refer to note 2 - acquisitions and divestitures to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
financing activities our cash outflows from financing activities consist primarily of share repurchases, dividends and repayment of debt, while cash inflows are primarily inflows from long-term and short-term debt borrowings and proceeds from the exercise of stock options.
cash used for financing activities was $1.6 billion in 2016 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $1.5 billion in 2015. the decrease is primarily attributable to higher proceeds received from the issuance of senior notes in 2015.
cash provided by financing activities was $1.5 billion in 2015 compared to cash used for financing activities of $462 million in 2014, driven by proceeds from the issuance of senior notes in 2015, partially offset by an increase in cash used for the repurchase of treasury shares.
during 2016, we used cash to repurchase 10 million shares for $1,123 million. in december of 2015, we repurchased 0.3 million shares for approximately $26 million, which settled in january of 2016. using a portion of the proceeds received from the sale of j.d. power, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase ("asr") agreement with a financial institution on september 7, 2016 to initiate share repurchases aggregating $750 million. we repurchased a total of 6.1 million shares under the asr agreement for an average purchase price of $122.18 per share. see note 9 - equity for further discussion.
during 2015, we used cash to repurchase 9.8 million shares for $974 million. an additional 0.3 million shares were repurchased in the fourth quarter of 2015 for approximately $26 million, which settled in january of 2016.
during 2014, we used cash to repurchase 4.6 million shares for $362 million. included in the repurchase were 0.5 million shares of the company's common stock from the personal holdings of harold w. mcgraw iii, then chairman of the company's board of directors and former president and ceo of the company ("mr. mcgraw"). the shares were purchased at a discount of 0.35% from the june 24, 2014 new york stock exchange closing price pursuant to a private transaction with mr. mcgraw. we repurchased these shares with cash for $41 million. this transaction was approved by the nominating and corporate governance committee of the company's board of directors after consultation with members of the financial policy committee.
on december 4, 2013, the board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to 50 million shares, which was approximately 18% of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time. our current repurchase program has no expiration date and purchases under this program may be made from time to time on the open market and in private transactions, depending on market conditions. as of december 31, 2016, 25.8 million shares remained available under our current repurchase program.
discontinued operations cash flows from discontinued operations reflects the classification of mcgraw hill construction as a discontinued operation. cash used for operating activities from discontinued operations decreased to $129 million in 2015 compared to cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations of $18 million in 2014 due to the tax payment on the gain on sale of mcgraw hill construction in 2015. cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations of $320 million in 2014 relates to proceeds received from the sale of mcgraw hill construction.
additional financing we have the ability to borrow a total of $1.2 billion through our commercial paper program, which is supported by our revolving $1.2 billion five-year credit agreement (our "credit facility") that we entered into on june 30, 2015. this credit facility will terminate on june 30, 2020. there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of december 31, 2016. commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of december 31, 2015 totaled $143 million with an average interest rate and term of 0.95% and 17 days, respectively.
depending on our indebtedness to cash flow ratio, we pay a commitment fee of 10 to 20 basis points for our credit facility, whether or not amounts have been borrowed. we currently pay a commitment fee of 15 basis points. the interest rate on borrowings under our credit facility is, at our option, calculated using rates that are primarily based on either the prevailing london inter-bank offered rate, the prime rate determined by the administrative agent or the federal funds rate. for certain borrowings under this credit facility, there is also a spread based on our indebtedness to cash flow ratio added to the applicable rate.
our credit facility contains certain covenants. the only financial covenant requires that our indebtedness to cash flow ratio, as defined in our credit facility, is not greater than 4 to 1, and this covenant level has never been exceeded.
contractual obligations we typically have various contractual obligations, which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, while other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts, are not recognized, but are disclosed herein. for example, we are contractually committed to contracts for information-technology outsourcing, certain enterprise-wide information-technology software licensing and maintenance and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements.
we believe that the amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash flow expected from operations and availability under our credit facility will be adequate for us to execute our business strategy and meet anticipated requirements for lease obligations, capital expenditures, working capital and debt service for 2017.
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31, 2016, over the next several years that relate to our continuing operations. additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, as referenced in the footnotes to the table:
1   our debt obligations are described in note 5 - debt to our consolidated financial statements.
2   amounts shown include taxes and escalation payments, see note 13 - commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our operating lease obligations.
3   other consists primarily of commitments for unconditional purchase obligations in contracts for information-technology outsourcing and certain enterprise-wide information-technology software licensing and maintenance.
as of december 31, 2016, we had $161 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. we have excluded the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits from our contractual obligations table because reasonable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities are not practicable.
as of december 31, 2016, we have recorded $1,080 million for our redeemable noncontrolling interest in our s&p dow jones indices llc partnership discussed in note 9 - equity to our consolidated financial statements.  specifically, this amount relates to the put option under the terms of the operating agreement of s&p dow jones indices llc, whereby, after december 31, 2017, cme group and cme group index services llc ("cgis") will have the right at any time to sell, and we are obligated to buy, we make contributions to our pension and postretirement plans in order to satisfy minimum funding requirements as well as additional contributions that we consider appropriate to improve the funded status of our plans. during 2016, we contributed $8 million and $6 million to our domestic and international retirement and postretirement plans, respectively. expected employer contributions in 2017 are $8 million for each of our domestic and international retirement and postretirement plans. in 2017, we may elect to make additional non-required contributions depending on investment performance and the pension plan status. see note 7 - employee benefits to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities, such as entities often referred to as specific purpose or variable interest entities where we are the primary beneficiary, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. as such we are not exposed to any financial liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.
reconciliation of non-gaap financial information free cash flow is a non-gaap financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and dividends and other payments paid to noncontrolling interests. capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects. our cash flow provided by operating activities is the most directly comparable u.s. gaap financial measure to free cash flow. additionally, we have considered certain items in evaluating free cash flow, which are included in the table below.
we believe the presentation of free cash flow and free cash flow excluding certain items allows our investors to evaluate the cash generated from our underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management. we use free cash flow to conduct and evaluate our business because we believe it typically presents a more conservative measure of cash flows since capital expenditures and dividends and other payments paid to noncontrolling interests are considered a necessary component of ongoing operations. free cash flow is useful for management and investors because it allows management and investors to evaluate the cash available to us to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, repurchase stock and fund ongoing operation and working capital needs.
the presentation of free cash flow and free cash flow excluding certain items are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with u.s. gaap. free cash flow, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. the following table presents a reconciliation of our cash flow provided by operating activities to free cash flow excluding the impact of the items below:

critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. unless otherwise indicated, all discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations relate to our continuing operations.
on an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, pension plans, incentive compensation and stock-based compensation, income taxes, contingencies and redeemable noncontrolling interests. we base our estimates on historical experience, current developments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under these circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that cannot readily be determined from other sources. there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates.
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it required assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations. management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to them in this md&a.
we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
revenue recognition revenue is recognized as it is earned when services are rendered. we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are performed, fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. revenue relating to products that provide for more than one deliverable is recognized based upon the relative fair value to the customer of each deliverable as each deliverable is provided. revenue relating to agreements that provide for more than one service is recognized based upon the relative fair value to the customer of each service component as each component is earned. if the fair value to the customer for each service is not objectively determinable, we make our best estimate of the services' standalone selling price and recognize revenue as earned as the services are delivered. the allocation of consideration received from multiple element arrangements that involve initial assignment of ratings and the future surveillance of ratings is determined through an analysis that considers cash consideration that would be received for instances when the service components are sold separately. in such cases, we defer portions of rating fees that we estimate will be attributed to future surveillance and recognize the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated surveillance periods. advertising revenue is recognized when the page is run. subscription income is recognized over the related subscription period.
for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, no significant changes have been made to the underlying assumptions related to estimates of revenue or the methodologies applied. we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of the new accounting standard of recognition of revenue will have on our consolidated financial statements. see note 1 - accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements for further information. at this point, we believe the new standard will have an impact on: 1) the accounting for certain long-term deferred revenue in our ratings segment which may contain a financing component, 2) the timing of revenue recognized in our market and commodities intelligence segment for long term contracts with price escalations, and 3) the accounting for fees for historical data in our market and commodities intelligence segment currently recognized over the term of a subscription. we do not expect these changes to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve methodology is based on historical analysis, a review of outstanding balances and current conditions. in determining these reserves, we consider, amongst other factors, the financial condition and risk profile of our customers, areas of specific or concentrated risk as well as applicable industry trends or market indicators. the impact on operating profit for a one percentage point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts is approximately $12 million.
for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, there were no material changes in our assumptions regarding the determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts. based on our current outlook these assumptions are not expected to significantly change in 2017.
accounting for the impairment of long-lived assets (including other intangible assets)
we evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. upon such an occurrence, recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to current forecasts of undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. for long-lived assets held for sale, assets are written down to fair value, less cost to sell. fair value is determined based on market evidence, discounted cash flows, appraised values or management's estimates, depending upon the nature of the assets.
for the year ended december 31, 2016, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $24 million related to a technology project at our market and commodities segment in selling and general expenses in our consolidated statement of income.
on july 31, 2014, we completed the sale of the company's aircraft to harold w. mcgraw iii, then chairman of the company's board of directors and former president and ceo of the company for a purchase price of $20 million. during the second quarter of 2014, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $6 million in (gain) loss on dispositions in our consolidated statement of income as a result of the pending sale. see note 14 - related party transactions to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
on june 30, 2014, we completed the sale of our data center to quality technology services, llc ("qts") which owns, operates, and manages data centers. net proceeds from the sale of $58 million were received in july of 2014. the sale includes all of the facilities and equipment on the south campus of our east windsor, new jersey location, inclusive of the rights and obligations associated with an adjoining solar power field. the sale resulted in an expense of $3 million recorded in (gain) loss on dispositions in our consolidated statement of income, which is in addition to the non-cash impairment charge of $36 million we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013 to adjust the value of the facilities and associated infrastructure classified as held for sale to their fair value.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets was $3.7 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.
goodwill as part of our annual impairment test of our four reporting units, we initially perform a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount. reporting units are generally an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. our qualitative assessment included, but was not limited to, consideration of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, cash flows, changes in key company personnel and our share price. if, based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount, no quantitative impairment test is performed. conversely, if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its respective carrying amount we perform a two-step quantitative impairment test. for 2016, based on our qualitative assessments, we determined that it is more likely than not that our reporting units' fair value was greater than their respective carrying amounts.
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a second step is performed which compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill. the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value, the difference is recognized as an impairment charge.
indefinite-lived intangible assets we evaluate the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets by first performing a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired. if, based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired, no quantitative impairment test is performed. conversely, if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired, a quantitative impairment test is performed. if necessary, the impairment test is performed by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value. if the indefinite-lived intangible asset carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment analysis is performed using the income approach. the fair value of loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. significant judgments inherent in these analyses include estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates, royalty rates and long-term growth rate assumptions. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for this indefinite-lived intangible asset and could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our financial position and results of operations.
we performed our impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and concluded that no impairment existed for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014.
retirement plans and postretirement healthcare and other benefits our employee pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances, including compensation increases, long-term return on pension plan assets, healthcare cost trends, discount rates and other factors. in determining such assumptions, we consult with outside actuaries and other advisors where deemed appropriate. in accordance with relevant accounting standards, if actual results differ from our assumptions, such differences are deferred and amortized over the estimated remaining lifetime of the plan participants. while we believe that the assumptions used in these calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could affect the expense and liabilities related to our pension and other postretirement benefits.
the following is a discussion of some significant assumptions that we make in determining costs and obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits:
•   healthcare cost trend assumptions are based on historical market data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends.
•   the expected return on assets assumption is calculated based on the plan's asset allocation strategy and projected market returns over the long-term.
our discount rate and return on asset assumptions used to determine the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost on our u.s. retirement plans are as follows:
return on assets                           6.25    %      6.25    %      6.25    %
1   at the end of 2015, we changed our approach used to measure service and interest costs on all of our retirement plans. see note 7 - employee benefits to our consolidated financial statements for further information.
stock-based compensation stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period, which typically is the vesting period. stock-based compensation is classified as both operating-related expense and selling and general expense in our consolidated statements of income.
we use a lattice-based option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted. the following assumptions were used in valuing the options granted:
volatility                                                   21 - 39%                    18 - 41%
weighted-average grant-date fair value per option              $27.57                      $23.41
because lattice-based option-pricing models incorporate ranges of assumptions, those ranges are disclosed. these assumptions are based on multiple factors, including historical exercise patterns, post-vesting termination rates, expected future exercise patterns and the expected volatility of our stock price. the risk-free interest rate is the imputed forward rate based on the u.s. treasury yield at the date of grant. we use the historical volatility of our stock price over the expected term of the options to estimate the expected volatility. the expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the lattice model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.
during 2015, we stopped granting stock options as part of our employees' total stock-based incentive awards. there were no stock options granted in 2016 and a minimal amount of stock options granted in 2015.
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in interest expense and operating expense, respectively.
judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits. in determining the need for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial performance of the operation that is recording a net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information.
we file income tax returns in the u.s. federal jurisdiction, various states, and foreign jurisdictions, and we are routinely under audit by many different tax authorities. we believe that our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law. this assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events. it is possible that examinations will be settled prior to december 31, 2017. if any of these tax audit settlements do occur within that period we would make any necessary adjustments to the accrual for unrecognized tax benefits. until formal resolutions are reached between us and the tax authorities, the determination of a possible audit settlement range with respect to the impact on unrecognized tax benefits is not practicable. on the basis of present information, it is our opinion that any assessments resulting from the current audits will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
we have determined that the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested within those foreign operations. accordingly, we have not provided deferred income taxes on these indefinitely reinvested earnings. a future distribution by the foreign subsidiaries of these earnings could result in additional tax liability, which may be material to our future reported results, financial position and cash flows.
for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we made no material changes in our assumptions regarding the determination of the provision for income taxes. however, certain events could occur that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions regarding deferred taxes. changes in current tax laws and applicable enacted tax rates could affect the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, thereby impacting our income tax provision.
contingencies we are subject to a number of lawsuits and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. we recognize a liability for such contingencies when both (a) information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (b) the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. we continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on an analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. because many of these matters are resolved over long periods of time, our estimate of liabilities may change due to new developments, changes in assumptions or changes in our strategy related to the matter. when we accrue for loss contingencies and the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range, we record its best estimate within the range. we disclose an estimated possible loss or a range of loss when it is at least reasonably possible that a loss may have been incurred.
redeemable noncontrolling interest the fair value component of the redeemable noncontrolling interest in indices business is based on a combination of an income and market valuation approach. our income and market valuation approaches may incorporate level 3 measures for instances when observable inputs are not available, including assumptions related to expected future net cash flows, long-term growth rates, the timing and nature of tax attributes, and the redemption features.
recent accounting standards see note 1 - accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of recent accounting standards. we do not expect these recent accounting standards to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity in future periods.

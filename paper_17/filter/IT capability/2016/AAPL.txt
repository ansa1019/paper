item 1a.   risk factors the following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. these risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this form 10-k. the following information should be read in conjunction with part ii, item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in part ii, item 8, "financial statements and supplementary data" of this form 10-k.
the business, financial condition and operating results of the company can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the company's actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the company's business, financial condition, operating results and stock price.
because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the company's financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.
global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company.
the company's operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. uncertainty about global and regional economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit, higher unemployment, financial market volatility, government austerity programs, negative financial news, declines in income or asset values and/or other factors. these worldwide and regional economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for the company's products and services. demand also could differ materially from the company's expectations as a result of currency fluctuations because the company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the u.s. to correspond with the effect of a strengthening of the u.s. dollar. other factors that could influence worldwide or regional demand include changes in fuel and other energy costs, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, unemployment, labor and healthcare costs, access to credit, consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior. these and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the company's products and services.
in the event of financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets, additional consolidation of the financial services industry, or significant financial service institution failures, there could be tightening in the credit markets, low liquidity and extreme volatility in fixed income, credit, currency and equity markets. this could have a number of effects on the company's business, including the insolvency or financial instability of outsourcing partners or suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development and/or manufacture products resulting in product delays; inability of customers, including channel partners, to obtain credit to finance purchases of the company's products; failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; and restrictions on the company's ability to issue new debt. other income and expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments; impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments; changes in interest rates; increases or decreases in cash balances; volatility in foreign exchange rates; and changes in fair value of derivative instruments. increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in the future on the company's financial instruments differing significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them.
global markets for the company's products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.
the company's products and services compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers.
the company's ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. the company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. as a result, the company must make significant investments in r&d. the company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and/or has applied to register numerous patents, trademarks and service marks. in contrast, many of the company's competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and emulating the company's products and infringing on its intellectual property. if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the company's intellectual property, the company's ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected.
the company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the ios mobile operating system and also markets related services, including third-party digital content and applications. the company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships; and the company has a minority market share in the global smartphone market. additionally, the company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the company's product features and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. the company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. the company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. some of the company's competitors have greater experience, product breadth and distribution channels than the company. because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and/or experience and a lower cost structure, they may be able to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. the company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the company's approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. the company's financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the company's ability to continually improve ios and ios devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages.
the company is the only authorized maker of hardware using macos, which has a minority market share in the personal computer market. this market has been contracting and is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems, most notably windows. in the market for personal computers and accessories, the company faces a significant number of competitors, many of which have broader product lines, lower priced products and a larger installed customer base. historically, consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors. price competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. an increasing number of internet-enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the company's existing products. the company's financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages.
to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions.
due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes, the company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products. the success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful product development, market acceptance, the company's ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction. accordingly, the company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions.
the company depends on the performance of distributors, carriers and other resellers.
the company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, national and regional retailers and value-added resellers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. the company also sells its products and third-party products in most of its major markets directly to education, enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and mid-sized businesses through its online and retail stores.
some carriers providing cellular network service for iphone subsidize users' purchases of the device. there is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the company's agreements with these carriers or in agreements the company enters into with new carriers.
many resellers have been adversely affected in the past by weak economic conditions. the company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers' stores with company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. these programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue. the financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the company's products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the company's products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company's products.
the company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.
the company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. the company also reviews its long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers' facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. if the company determines that impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value. although the company believes its provisions related to inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate, no assurance can be given that the company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the company competes.
the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. consistent with industry practice, components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts and open orders, in each case based on projected demand. manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days. because the company's markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.
future operating results depend upon the company's ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.
because the company currently obtains components from single or limited sources, the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. while the company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. a number of suppliers of components may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the company's ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms. the effects of global or regional economic conditions on the company's suppliers, described in "global and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company" above, also could affect the company's ability to obtain components. therefore, the company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases.
the company's new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. when a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers' yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected for any number of reasons, including if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company's requirements. the supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained, or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the company.
the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the u.s.
substantially all of the company's manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by a few outsourcing partners located primarily in asia. the company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. while these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the company's direct control over production and distribution. it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the company's flexibility to respond to changing conditions. although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability. while the company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur.
the company relies on sole-sourced outsourcing partners in the u.s., asia and europe to supply and manufacture many critical components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the company's hardware products. any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the company's cost or supply of components or finished goods. in addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues.
the company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. while these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the net realizable value of these assets could be negatively impacted.
the company's products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin and harm to the company's reputation.
the company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects. sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those sold by the company, often contain "bugs" that can unexpectedly interfere with the software's intended operation. the company's online services may from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns, or errors. defects may also occur in components and products the company purchases from third parties. there can be no assurance the company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware, software and services it sells. failure to do so could result in lost revenue, significant warranty and other expenses and harm to the company's reputation.
the company relies on access to third-party digital content, which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
the company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. this includes the right to sell currently available music, movies, tv shows and books. the licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future. other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the company's access to, or increase the cost of, such content. the company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach. failure to obtain the right to make available third-party digital content, or to make available such content on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the company's financial condition and operating results.
some third-party digital content providers require the company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. if requirements change, the company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. there is no assurance the company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. in addition, certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the company to license its digital rights management, which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the company's content providers.
the company's future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.
the company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third‐party software applications and services. there is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the company's products. if third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the company's products, customers may choose not to buy the company's products.
with respect to its mac products, the company believes the availability of third‐party software applications and services depends in part on the developers' perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software for the company's products compared to windows-based products. this analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of mac sales and the costs of developing such applications and services. if the company's minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the mac's prospects, developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the company's mac products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger windows market.
with respect to ios devices, the company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications, which are distributed through a single distribution channel, the app store. ios devices are subject to rapid technological change, and, if third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers. as with applications for the company's mac products, the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers' perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining or upgrading software for the company's ios devices rather than its competitors' platforms, such as android. if developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the company's ios devices may suffer.
the company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
many of the company's products include third-party intellectual property, which requires licenses from those third parties. based on past experience and industry practice, the company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms. there is, however, no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all. failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude the company from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the company's financial condition and operating results.
the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have not yet been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business, and additional claims may arise in the future.
for example, technology companies, including many of the company's competitors, frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. in addition, patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. the intellectual property rights claims against the company have generally increased over time and may continue to increase. in particular, the company's cellular enabled products compete with products from mobile communication and media device companies that hold significant patent portfolios, and the company has faced a significant number of patent claims against it. the company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of u.s. jurisdictions and before the u.s. international trade commission, as well as internationally in various countries. the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.
regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights, or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants, the company may have to engage in protracted litigation. if the company is found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights, regardless of whether it can develop non-infringing technology, it may be required to pay substantial damages or royalties to a third-party, or it may be subject to a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the company from marketing or selling certain products.
in certain cases, the company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements, although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. these licenses may also significantly increase the company's operating expenses.
regardless of the merit of particular claims, litigation may be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the company's operations and distracting to management. in recognition of these considerations, the company may enter into arrangements to settle litigation.
in management's opinion, there is not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights. however, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain.
although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management's expectations, the company's consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. further, such an outcome could result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.
the company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide, changes to which could increase the company's costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the company's business.
the company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas. these u.s. and foreign laws and regulations affect the company's activities including, but not limited to, in areas of labor, advertising, digital content, consumer protection, real estate, billing, e-commerce, promotions, quality of services, telecommunications, mobile communications and media, television, intellectual property ownership and infringement, tax, import and export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, anti-competition, environmental, health and safety.
by way of example, laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the company operates are extensive and subject to change. such changes could include, among others, restrictions on the production, manufacture, distribution and use of devices, locking devices to a carrier's network, or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier's network. these devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies, as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks. these certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications, or delays in product shipment dates, or could preclude the company from selling certain products.
compliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business. any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation, could individually or in the aggregate make the company's products and services less attractive to the company's customers, delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions, or cause the company to change or limit its business practices. the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the company's employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the company's policies and procedures.
the company's business is subject to the risks of international operations.
the company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations. compliance with applicable u.s. and foreign laws and regulations, such as import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, environmental laws, labor laws and anti-competition regulations, increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. although the company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations, a violation by the company's employees, contractors, or agents could nevertheless occur. in some cases, compliance with the laws and regulations of one country could violate the laws and regulations of another country. violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the company's brand, international growth efforts and business.
the company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including, but not limited to, economic and labor conditions, increased duties, taxes and other costs and political instability. margins on sales of the company's products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations, including duties, tariffs and antidumping penalties. the company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets. there can be no assurance the company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.
the company's retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.
the company's retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. the company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the company's more typical retail stores. due to the high cost structure associated with the company's retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs.
many factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the company's control, pose risks and uncertainties. these risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity, as well as the company's inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation, the company's failure to manage relationships with its existing retail partners, more challenging environments in managing retail operations outside the u.s., costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory, and the company's inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.
investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the company's ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated.
the company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the company's due diligence. these new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful.
the company's business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions.
the company may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions. these may be caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions. system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and the company's disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. such failures or disruptions could, among other things, prevent access to the company's online stores and services, preclude retail store transactions, compromise company or customer data, and result in delayed or cancelled orders. system failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products, delivery of online services, transactions processing and financial reporting.
there may be breaches of the company's information technology systems that materially damage business partner and customer relationships, curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services, or subject the company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.
the company's business requires it to use and store customer, employee and business partner personally identifiable information ("pii"). this may include, among other information, names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, contact preferences, tax identification numbers and payment account information. although malicious attacks to gain access to pii affect many companies across various industries, the company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the amount of pii it manages.
the company requires user names and passwords in order to access its information technology systems. the company also uses encryption and authentication technologies designed to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to company data or accounts. as with all companies, these security measures are subject to third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management, or other irregularities. for example, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access the company's information technology systems. to help protect customers and the company, the company monitors accounts and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which may result in the delay or loss of customer orders.
the company devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption and other security measures to protect its systems and data, but these security measures cannot provide absolute security. to the extent the company was to experience a breach of its systems and was unable to protect sensitive data, such a breach could materially damage business partner and customer relationships, and curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services. moreover, if a computer security breach affects the company's systems or results in the unauthorized release of pii, the company's reputation and brand could be materially damaged, use of the company's products and services could decrease, and the company could be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. while the company maintains insurance coverage that, subject to policy terms and conditions and subject to a significant self-insured retention, is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk.
the company is also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under its contracts with payment card processors. under these rules and obligations, if information is compromised, the company could be liable to payment card issuers for associated expenses and penalties. in addition, if the company fails to follow payment card industry security standards, even if no customer information is compromised, the company could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs.
the company's business is subject to a variety of u.s. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.
the company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of pii. in many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also may restrict transfers of pii among the company and its international subsidiaries. several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the company to incur substantial costs or require the company to change its business practices. noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.
the company makes statements about its use and disclosure of pii through its privacy policy, information provided on its website and press statements. any failure by the company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others. penalties could include ongoing audit requirements or significant legal liability.
the company's success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel.
much of the company's future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its chief executive officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in silicon valley, where most of the company's key personnel are located.
the company's business may be impacted by political events, war, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters and other business interruptions.
war, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a material adverse effect on the company, its suppliers, logistics providers, manufacturing vendors and customers, including channel partners. the company's business operations are subject to interruption by, among others, natural disasters, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond its control. such events could decrease demand for the company's products, make it difficult or impossible for the company to make and deliver products to its customers, including channel partners, or to receive components from its suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies in the company's supply chain. while the company's suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the company's business and harm to the company's reputation. should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the company's manufacturing vendors and component suppliers. the majority of the company's r&d activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology systems and other critical business operations, including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters. in the event of a natural disaster, the company could incur significant losses, require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations.
the company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate.
the company's profit margins vary across its products and distribution channels. the company's software, accessories, and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the company's other products. gross margins on the company's hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and configuration changes, and component, warranty, and other cost fluctuations. the company's direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners. in addition, the company's gross margin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic or channel mix, component cost increases, the strengthening u.s. dollar, price competition, or the introduction of new products, including those that have higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing.
the company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand. additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. further, the company generates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. the company could also be subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the company's products, issues with new product introductions, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the company's logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.
the company's stock price is subject to volatility.
the company's stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. additionally, the company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies' operating performance. price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock's price at a given point in time. the company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. the company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. future dividends are subject to declaration by the company's board of directors, and the company's share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. if the company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.
the company's financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the u.s. dollar versus local currencies.
the company's primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non-u.s. dollar-denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide. weakening of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar adversely affects the u.s. dollar value of the company's foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the company's products. margins on sales of the company's products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. in some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollar's strengthening, or at all, which would adversely affect the u.s. dollar value of the company's foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings. conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar, while generally beneficial to the company's foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the company's cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.
the company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. the use of such hedging activities may not offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.
the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio.
given the global nature of its business, the company has both domestic and international investments. credit ratings and pricing of the company's investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, economic risk, political risk, sovereign risk or other factors. as a result, the value and liquidity of the company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. therefore, although the company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in a significant realized loss.
the company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.
the company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. the company also sells its products directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. a substantial majority of the company's outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party financing arrangements or credit insurance. the company's exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. the company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the company. in addition, the company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. as of september 24, 2016, a significant portion of the company's trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers, and its vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in asia. while the company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.
the company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new u.s. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities.
the company is subject to taxes in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including ireland, where a number of the company's subsidiaries are organized. due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. the company's effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the u.s. and ireland.
the company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the u.s. internal revenue service (the "irs") and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. the company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. if the company's effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the u.s. or ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the company's taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the company's financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.

fiscal 2016 highlights net sales declined 8% or $18.1 billion during 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by a year-over-year decrease in iphone net sales and the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar, partially offset by an increase in services. in april 2016, the company announced a significant increase to its capital return program by raising the expected total size of the program from $200 billion to $250 billion through march 2018. this included increasing its share repurchase authorization from $140 billion to $175 billion and raising its quarterly dividend from $0.52 to $0.57 per share beginning in may 2016. during 2016, the company spent $29.0 billion to repurchase shares of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $12.2 billion. additionally, the company issued $23.9 billion of u.s. dollar-denominated term debt and a$1.4 billion of australian dollar-denominated term debt during 2016.
fiscal 2015 highlights net sales rose 28% or $50.9 billion during 2015 compared to 2014, driven by a year-over-year increase in iphone net sales. iphone net sales and unit sales in 2015 increased in all of the company's reportable operating segments. the company also experienced year-over-year net sales increases in mac, services and other products. apple watch, which launched during the third quarter of 2015, accounted for more than 100% of the year-over-year growth in net sales of other products. net sales growth during 2015 was partially offset by the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar and lower ipad net sales. total net sales increased in each of the company's reportable operating segments, with particularly strong growth in greater china where year-over-year net sales increased 84%.
in april 2015, the company announced a significant increase to its capital return program by raising the expected total size of the program to $200 billion through march 2017. this included increasing its share repurchase authorization to $140 billion and raising its quarterly dividend to $0.52 per share beginning in may 2015. during 2015, the company spent $36.0 billion to repurchase shares of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $11.6 billion. additionally, the company issued $14.5 billion of u.s. dollar-denominated, €4.8 billion of euro-denominated, sfr1.3 billion of swiss franc-denominated, £1.3 billion of british pound-denominated, a$2.3 billion of australian dollar-denominated and ¥250.0 billion of japanese yen-denominated term debt during 2015.

iphone net sales and unit sales decreased during 2016 compared to 2015. the company believes the sales decline is due primarily to a lower rate of iphone upgrades during 2016 compared to 2015 and challenging macroeconomic conditions in a number of major markets in 2016. average selling prices ("asps") for iphone were lower year-over-year during 2016 due primarily to a different mix of iphones, including the iphone se introduced in 2016, and the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar.
the year-over-year growth in iphone net sales and unit sales during 2015 primarily resulted from strong demand for iphone 6 and 6 plus during 2015. overall asps for iphone increased during 2015 compared to 2014, due primarily to the introduction of iphone 6 and 6 plus in september 2014, partially offset by the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar.

mac net sales and unit sales decreased during 2016 compared to 2015. the year-over-year decline in mac unit sales during 2016 was at rates similar to the overall market. the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar also negatively impacted mac net sales.
the year-over-year growth in mac net sales and unit sales during 2015 was driven by strong demand for mac portables. mac asps declined during 2015 compared to 2014 largely due to the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar.

gross margin gross margin for 2016, 2015 and 2014 is as follows (dollars in millions):
gross margin decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 due primarily to the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar and, to a lesser extent, unfavorable leverage on fixed costs from lower net sales, partially offset by a favorable shift in mix to services.
the year-over-year increase in the gross margin percentage in 2015 was driven primarily by a favorable shift in mix to products with higher margins and, to a lesser extent, by improved leverage on fixed costs from higher net sales. these positive factors were partially offset primarily by higher product cost structures and, to a lesser extent, by the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar.
the company anticipates gross margin during the first quarter of 2017 to be between 38% and 38.5%. the foregoing statement regarding the company's expected gross margin percentage in the first quarter of 2017 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. the company's future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to, those set forth in part i, item 1a of this form 10-k under the heading "risk factors" and those described in this paragraph. in general, the company believes gross margins will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions, potential increases in the cost of components, and potential strengthening of the u.s. dollar, as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the company's sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. in response to competitive pressures, the company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. gross margins could also be affected by the company's ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. due to the company's significant international operations, its financial condition and operating results, including gross margins, could be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.
operating expenses operating expenses for 2016, 2015 and 2014 are as follows (dollars in millions):
2016                                                         change                2015          change                2014
research and development                $10,045            25     %          $8,067            34     %          $6,041
research and development the year-over-year growth in r&d expense in 2016 and 2015 was driven primarily by an increase in headcount and related expenses, and material costs to support expanded r&d activities. the company continues to believe that focused investments in r&d are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products that are central to the company's core business strategy.
selling, general and administrative the decrease in selling, general and administrative expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to lower discretionary expenditures and advertising costs, partially offset by an increase in headcount and related expenses. the year-over-year growth in selling, general and administrative expense in 2015 was primarily due to increased headcount and related expenses, and higher spending on marketing and advertising.
other income/(expense), net other income/(expense), net for 2016, 2015 and 2014 are as follows (dollars in millions):

the year-over-year increase in other income/(expense), net during 2016 and 2015 was due primarily to higher interest income, partially offset by higher interest expense on debt and higher expenses associated with foreign exchange activity. the weighted-average interest rate earned by the company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 1.73%, 1.49% and 1.11% in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes and effective tax rates for 2016, 2015 and 2014 are as follows (dollars in millions):
provision for income taxes   15,685             $19,121             $13,973
the company's effective tax rates for 2016, 2015 and 2014 differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings, a substantial portion of which was generated by subsidiaries organized in ireland, for which no u.s. taxes are provided when such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. the lower effective tax rate in 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to greater r&d tax credits. the higher effective tax rate during 2015 compared to 2014 was due primarily to higher foreign taxes.
as of september 24, 2016, the company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses and tax credits of $4.1 billion and deferred tax liabilities of $26.0 billion. management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. the company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and the amount of a valuation allowance.
during the fourth quarter of 2016, the company reached a partial settlement with the irs on its examination of the years 2010 through 2012. in connection with this settlement, the company recognized a tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2016 that was not significant to its consolidated financial statements. all years prior to 2013 are closed, except for the years 2010 through 2012 relating to r&d tax credits. in addition, the company is subject to audits by state, local and foreign tax authorities. in major states and major foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 2003 generally remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities. management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. however, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. if any issues addressed in the company's tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, the company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.
on august 30, 2016, the european commission announced its decision that ireland granted state aid to the company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the irish branches of two subsidiaries of the company (the "state aid decision"). the state aid decision orders ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the company for the period june 2003 through september 2014. irish legislative changes, effective as of the beginning of 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. the company believes the state aid decision to be without merit and intends to appeal to the general court of the court of justice of the european union. ireland has also announced its intention to appeal the state aid decision. while the european commission announced a recovery amount of up to €13 billion, plus interest, the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by ireland in accordance with the european commission's guidance. once the recovery amount is computed by ireland, the company anticipates funding it, including interest, out of foreign cash into escrow, pending conclusion of all appeals. the company believes that any incremental irish corporate income taxes potentially due would be creditable against u.s. taxes.

in june 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-13, financial instruments - credit losses (topic 326): measurement of credit losses on financial instruments ("asu 2016-13"), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. asu 2016-13 will be effective for the company beginning in its first quarter of 2021 and early adoption is permitted. the company does not believe the adoption of asu 2016-13 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
revenue recognition in may 2014, the fasb issued asu no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606) ("asu 2014-09"), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. asu 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when products are transferred to customers. asu 2014-09 will be effective for the company beginning in its first quarter of 2019, and early adoption is permitted.
subsequently, the fasb has issued the following standards related to asu 2014-09: asu no. 2016-08, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606): principal versus agent considerations ("asu 2016-08"); asu no. 2016-10, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606): identifying performance obligations and licensing ("asu 2016-10"); and asu no. 2016-12, revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606): narrow-scope improvements and practical expedients ("asu 2016-12"). the company must adopt asu 2016-08, asu 2016-10 and asu 2016-12 with asu 2014-09 (collectively, the "new revenue standards").
the new revenue standards may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. the company currently expects to adopt the new revenue standards in its first quarter of 2018 utilizing the full retrospective transition method. the company does not expect adoption of the new revenue standards to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the company has financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose the company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to the company, or engages in leasing, hedging, or r&d services with the company.
the following table presents certain payments due by the company under contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of september 24, 2016, and excludes amounts already recorded on the consolidated balance sheet, except for term debt (in millions):
manufacturing purchase obligations                    24,695                939                                                    1,830                                      1,127                      28,591
operating leases as of september 24, 2016, the company's total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $7.6 billion. the company's retail store and other facility leases are typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options.
manufacturing purchase obligations the company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the company's products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. these outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. the company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. consistent with industry practice, the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. as of september 24, 2016, the company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $28.6 billion.
other purchase obligations the company's other purchase obligations were comprised of commitments to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and commitments related to advertising, licensing, r&d, internet and telecommunications services, energy and other obligations. as of september 24, 2016, the company had other purchase obligations of $6.6 billion.
the company's other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets consist primarily of deferred tax liabilities, gross unrecognized tax benefits and the related gross interest and penalties. as of september 24, 2016, the company had non-current deferred tax liabilities of $26.0 billion. additionally, as of september 24, 2016, the company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $7.7 billion and an additional $1.0 billion for gross interest and penalties classified as non-current liabilities. at this time, the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table.
indemnification the company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. other agreements entered into by the company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the company or an indemnified third-party. in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of end-users of its operating system or application software for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights.
the company offers an iphone upgrade program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iphone in the u.s., the u.k. and mainland china. the iphone upgrade program provides customers the right to trade in that iphone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iphone, provided certain conditions are met. the company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within revenue.
the company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. under these agreements, the company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. however, the company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") and the company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the company's management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. note 1, "summary of significant accounting policies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company's consolidated financial statements. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material.
management believes the company's critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation and impairment of marketable securities, inventory valuation, valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimation of purchase commitment cancellation fees, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the company's financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. the company's senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and finance committee of the company's board of directors.
revenue recognition net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, accessories, and service and support contracts. the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title, risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. for most of the company's product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. for online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the u.s., and for certain other sales, the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. for payment terms in excess of the company's standard payment terms, revenue is recognized as payments become due unless the company has positive evidence that the sales price is fixed or determinable, such as a successful history of collection, without concession, on comparable arrangements. the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and third-party digital content sold on the itunes store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. the company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry-specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i) standalone sales of software products, (ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.
for multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product's functionality, undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product's essential software and/or undelivered non-software services, the company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. in such circumstances, the company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value ("vsoe"), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price ("tpe") and (iii) best estimate of selling price ("esp"). vsoe generally exists only when the company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that deliverable. esps reflect the company's best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis.
for sales of qualifying versions of ios devices, mac, apple watch and apple tv, the company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades to the device's essential software and/or non-software services free of charge. because the company has neither vsoe nor tpe for the unspecified software upgrade rights or the non-software services, revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the company's esps. revenue allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services based on the company's esps is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided.
the company's process for determining esps involves management's judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. should future facts and circumstances change, the company's esps and the future rate of related amortization for unspecified software upgrades and non-software services related to future sales of these devices could change. factors subject to change include the unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services offered, the estimated value of unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services and the estimated period unspecified software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided.
the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs. for transactions involving price protection, the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. the company's policy requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. for the company's other customer incentive programs, the estimated cost is recognized at the later of the date at which the company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the company's historical experience. future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue. additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. management's estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. if a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeems such incentives, the company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have an adverse impact on the company's operating results.
valuation and impairment of marketable securities the company's investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, in the company's consolidated balance sheets. changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities impact the company's net income only when such securities are sold or an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security's cost basis. the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would require the company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. in making this determination, the company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost; the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto; and the company's intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. the company's assessment of whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security, which would have an adverse impact on the company's operating results.
inventory valuation, valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimation of purchase commitment cancellation fees the company must purchase components and build inventory in advance of product shipments and has invested in manufacturing-related assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers' facilities. in addition, the company has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. the company records a write-down for inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. the company performs a detailed review of inventory that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels and component cost trends. the company also reviews its manufacturing-related capital assets and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. if the company determines that an asset is not recoverable, it records an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of such an asset exceeds its fair value.
the industries in which the company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. in certain circumstances the company may be required to record additional write-downs of inventory and/or impairments of manufacturing-related assets or inventory prepayments. these circumstances include future demand or market conditions for the company's products being less favorable than forecasted, unforeseen technological changes or changes to the company's product development plans that negatively impact the utility of any of these assets, or significant deterioration in the financial condition of one or more of the company's suppliers that hold any of the company's manufacturing-related assets or to whom the company has made an inventory prepayment. such write-downs would adversely affect the company's financial condition and operating results in the period when the additional write-downs were recorded.
the company accrues for estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled. consistent with industry practice, the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders in each case based on projected demand. manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover the company's forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days. if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the company's products, a change in the company's product development plans, or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company's products, the company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees were identified and recorded.
warranty costs the company accrues for the estimated cost of warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the company's typical experience. the company regularly reviews these estimates and the current installed base of products subject to warranty protection to assess the appropriateness of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary. if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect the company's financial condition and operating results.
income taxes the company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of its reported operating results. the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.
the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. in the event that the company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. in addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws. resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management's expectations could have a material impact on the company's financial condition and operating results.
legal and other contingencies as discussed in part i, item 3 of this form 10-k under the heading "legal proceedings" and in part ii, item 8 of this form 10-k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note 10, "commitments and contingencies," the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. the company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. however, the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company is subject to significant uncertainty. therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management's expectations, the company's consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.

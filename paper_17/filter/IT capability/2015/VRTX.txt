item 1a. risk factors risk factors investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk, and you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10-k. if any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer, possibly materially. in that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline.
risks related to our business our business and future revenues depend heavily on our ability to successfully commercialize orkambi. if we are unable to do so, or if reimbursement levels agreed to by third-party payors are unfavorable or do not meet the expectations of investors or public equity market analysts, our business will be materially harmed and the market price of our common stock would likely decline.
we believe that a significant portion of the value attributed to our company by investors is based on the commercial potential of orkambi, which was approved in the united states in july 2015 and the european union in november 2015 for the treatment of patients with cf twelve years of age and older who are homozygous for the f508del mutation in their cftr gene. while we recognized our first net product revenues from sales of orkambi in the united states in the second half of 2015, we are in the early stages of the commercial launch of this product and are unable to predict the future level of net product revenues we will recognize from sales of orkambi in the united states. outside of the united states, we do not expect to recognize significant orkambi net product revenues in 2016 other than in germany due to the time it takes to complete the reimbursement discussions in many ex-u.s. countries.
if orkambi were to become subject to problems such as safety or efficacy issues, the introduction or greater acceptance of competing products, changes in reimbursement policies of payors and other third parties, or adverse legal, administrative, regulatory or legislative developments, our ability to commercialize orkambi would be impaired and our stock price would likely decline. in addition, our ability to successfully commercialize orkambi is dependent on, among other things, the rate at which patients initiate treatment of orkambi, the proportion of initiated patients who remain on treatment and the compliance rate for patients who remain on treatment. since the regulations that govern pricing, coverage and reimbursement for drugs vary widely from country to country, there is no assurance that coverage and reimbursement will be available outside of the united states and, even if it is available, the level of reimbursement may not be satisfactory. adverse pricing limitations or a delay in obtaining coverage and reimbursement would decrease our future net product revenues and harm our business.
our future success also is dependent on our ability to expand the number of cf patients who are eligible for treatment with orkambi. we recently completed a phase 3 clinical trial evaluating lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor for the treatment of patients with cf six to eleven years of age who are homozygous for the f508del mutation in their cftr gene. the clinical trial met its primary safety endpoint and data from the clinical trial showed that the combination was generally well-tolerated. based on these results, we plan to submit a snda to the fda in the second quarter of 2016 seeking approval for patients with cf six to eleven years of age who are homozygous for the f508del mutation in their cftr gene. a second phase 3 clinical trial evaluating lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in this same patient population to support approval in the european union is ongoing. in order to expand the market to this patient population in the european union, the clinical trial will need to demonstrate that orkambi is both safe and effective for the treatment of these patients. these clinical trials and our discussions with regulatory authorities are subject to the same risks and uncertainties that are described in these risk factors with respect to the development of our drug candidates. there can be no assurance that the results from these clinical trials, or the data included in our submissions to regulatory authorities, will be sufficient to obtain approval for the use of lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor in this additional patient population.
our business is dependent on kalydeco net product revenues and if we are unable to sustain our kalydeco net product revenues, our business will be materially harmed and the market price of our common stock would decline.
kalydeco net product revenues represented approximately 61.2% and 79.9% of our total revenues in 2015 and 2014, respectively, and we expect kalydeco net product revenues to continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenues in future periods. if we are unable to sustain kalydeco net products revenues for any reason, such as safety or efficacy issues, the introduction or greater acceptance of competing products, changes in reimbursement policies of payors and other third parties, or adverse legal, administrative, regulatory or legislative developments, our ability to commercialize kalydeco would be impaired and our product revenues would decrease and our financial position and stock price would be materially harmed.
in addition, our success is dependent on our ability to continue to expand the label for kalydeco and to increase the number of patients eligible and reimbursed for treatment with kalydeco in the united states and ex-u.s. markets. in the first quarter of 2016, we expect to initiate a clinical trial for ivacaftor in patients with cf less than two years of age to evaluate the effect of ivacaftor on markers of cf disease in young children. there can be no assurance that the data from this clinical trial will be sufficient to obtain approval for ivacaftor in this patient population. additionally, in february 2016, we received a complete response letter from the fda regarding our snda for ivacaftor for patients with cf two years of age and older who have one of 23 residual function mutations. the fda determined that it cannot approve the snda in its present form. while we plan to meet with the fda regarding the snda to determine an appropriate path forward, there can be no assurance that the outcome from these discussions will be sufficient to obtain approval for ivacaftor in this patient population.
we have a history of incurring losses, and we cannot predict the extent of our future profitability.
we have incurred significant operating losses in each of the last three years. our future revenues will be dependent on our ability to successfully commercialize orkambi and on continued sales of kalydeco. our ability to achieve and sustain profitability depends on the extent to which we can increase our revenue and control our costs in order to, among other things, counter any unforeseen difficulties, complications or other unknown factors that may impair future revenue or require additional expenditures. because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to predict the extent of our future profitability or losses. as an example, we briefly achieved profitability in 2011 based on strong initial sales of incivek but subsequently returned to incurring losses after experiencing a rapid decline in the number of patients being treated with incivek. if we are unable to sustain sales of kalydeco and increase sales of orkambi, we may not achieve and/or sustain profitability.
if our competitors bring drugs with superior product profiles to market, our drugs may not be competitive and our revenues could decline.
orkambi, kalydeco and any drugs that we develop in the future may not be able to compete effectively with marketed drugs or new drugs that may be developed by competitors. there are many other companies developing drugs for the same indications that we are pursuing. in order to compete successfully in these areas, we must demonstrate improved safety, efficacy and/or tolerability, and ease of manufacturing, and gain and maintain market acceptance over competing drugs. many of our competitors, including major pharmaceutical companies such as abbvie, bristol-myers squibb, gilead, johnson & johnson, merck, novartis, pfizer, sanofi and roche, possess substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we possess. potential competitors also include other public and private companies, academic institutions, government agencies, other public and private research organizations and charitable venture philanthropy organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and/or establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. as an example, we experienced a rapid decline in the number of patients being treated with incivek in 2013 and 2014.
mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. smaller and other early-stage companies also may prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. these third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
a number of companies are seeking to identify and develop drug candidates for the treatment of cf, including concert pharmaceuticals, genzyme, which is a division of sanofi, novartis, pfizer, proqr therapeutics, ptc therapeutics, shire and several private companies. our competitors have research and development programs directed at identifying cftr potentiators, cftr correctors, enac inhibitors and drug candidates with other mechanisms of action or that utilize new therapeutic approaches that seek to address the underlying cause of cf. our success in rapidly developing and commercializing kalydeco and orkambi may increase the resources that our competitors allocate to the development of these potential treatments for cf. if one or more competing therapies are successfully developed as a treatment for patients with cf, our revenues from orkambi, kalydeco and/or other compounds, if then approved, could face competitive pressures. if one or more competing therapies prove to be superior to our existing products and/or drug candidates for the treatment of cf, our business would be materially adversely affected.
if we discover safety issues with any of our products or if we fail to comply with continuing u.s. and applicable foreign regulations, commercialization efforts for the product could be negatively affected, the approved product could lose its approval or sales could be suspended, and our business could be materially harmed.
our products are subject to continuing regulatory oversight, including the review of additional safety information. drugs are more widely used by patients once approval has been obtained and therefore side-effects and other problems may be observed after approval that were not seen or anticipated, or were not as prevalent or severe, during pre-approval clinical trials or nonclinical studies. for example, in december 2012, we updated the incivek label in the united states to include a boxed warning stating that fatal and non-fatal serious skin reactions have been reported in patients taking incivek combination treatment. the subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with a product could negatively affect commercial sales of the product, result in restrictions on the product or lead to the withdrawal of the product from the market. each of our two commercial products and our most advanced drug candidates, contain ivacaftor, either alone or in combination with one or more other compounds. as a result, if either of our products were to experience safety issues, both orkambi and kalydeco, as well as one or more of our drug candidates, may be adversely affected. the reporting of adverse safety events involving our products or public speculation about such events could cause our stock price to decline or experience periods of volatility.
if we or our collaborators fail to comply with applicable continuing regulatory requirements, we or our collaborators may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals for specific products, product recalls and seizures, operating restrictions and/or criminal prosecutions. in addition, the manufacturers we engage to make our products and the manufacturing facilities in which our products are made are subject to periodic review and inspection by the fda and foreign regulatory authorities. if problems are identified during the review or inspection of these manufacturers or manufacturing facilities, it could result in our inability to use the facility to make our product or a determination that inventories are not safe for commercial sale.
our drugs may not gain or maintain market acceptance among physicians and patients. effectively marketing our drugs and any of our drug candidates, if approved, requires substantial efforts, both prior to launch and after approval. physicians may elect not to prescribe our drugs, and patients may elect not to request or take them, for a variety of reasons including:
•   prevalence and severity of adverse side-effects;
•   lack of reimbursement availability from third-party payors;
•   lower demonstrated efficacy, safety and/or tolerability compared to other drugs;
•   lack of cost-effectiveness;
•   a decision to wait for the approval of other therapies in development that have significant perceived advantages over our drug;
•   other potential advantages of alternative treatment methods; and
•   ineffective sales, marketing and/or distribution support.
if our drugs fail to achieve or maintain market acceptance, we will not be able to generate significant revenues in future periods.
government and other third-party payors seek to contain costs of health care through legislative and other means. if they fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement rates for our products, our revenues will be harmed.
in both domestic and foreign markets, our sales of products depend in part upon the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. third-party payors include government health programs such as medicare and medicaid in the united states and the national health care systems in many international markets, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. the trend in the u.s. health care industry and elsewhere is cost containment and efforts of third-party payors to contain or reduce health care costs that may adversely affect our ability to establish or maintain appropriate prices for our products or any drugs that we may develop and commercialize. in certain foreign markets, pricing or profitability of therapeutic and other pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control. reimbursement agencies in europe are often more conservative than those in the united states and the reimbursement process is often slower since reimbursement decisions are made on a country-by-country basis. in the united states, there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental control as currently exists in europe. moreover, certain presidential candidates in the united states have announced an interest in further regulation of the prices of pharmaceutical products. the aca requires discounts under the medicare drug benefit program and increased the rebates paid by pharmaceutical companies on drugs covered by medicaid. the aca also imposes an annual fee, which increases annually, on sales by branded pharmaceutical manufacturers.
in addition, third-party payors attempt to contain health care costs by demanding price discounts or rebates and limiting both the types and variety of drugs that they will cover and the amounts that they will pay for drugs. as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our products. we might need to conduct post-marketing studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products or any other future products to such payors' satisfaction. such studies might require us to commit a significant amount of management's time and our financial and other resources. our products might not ultimately be considered cost-effective. adequate third-party reimbursement might not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
reimbursement rates vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on payments allowed for lower-cost products that already are reimbursed, may be incorporated into existing payments for other products or services and may reflect budgetary constraints and/or imperfections in the data used to calculate these rates. net prices for products are reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government health care programs and privately-negotiated discounts. while we have implemented policies in an effort to comply with mandated reimbursement rates, the u.s. federal government, state governments and private payors frequently pursue actions against pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies alleging that the companies have overstated prices in order to inflate reimbursement rates. any such action could adversely affect the pricing of and revenues from our products. additionally, in the united states and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals and initiatives to change the health care system in ways that could affect our ability to sell products. some of these proposed and implemented reforms have resulted, or could result, in reduced reimbursement rates for our current or future products, which would adversely affect our business, operations and financial results.
specialty pharmaceuticals are drugs that are prescribed by specialist physicians to treat rare or life-threatening conditions and typically address smaller patient populations. each of our products is a specialty pharmaceutical product, and our research and development programs are primarily focused on developing additional specialty pharmaceutical products. the increasing availability and use of innovative specialty pharmaceuticals, combined with their relative higher cost as compared to other types of pharmaceutical products, is beginning to generate significant third-party payor interest in developing cost-containment strategies targeted to this sector. government regulations in both non-u.s. and u.s markets could limit the prices that can be charged for our products and may limit our commercial opportunity. the increasing use of health technology assessments in markets around the world and the financial challenges faced by many governments may lead to significant adverse effects on our business.
any legislation or regulatory changes or relaxation of laws that restrict imports of drugs from other countries also could reduce the net price we receive for our products.
if regulatory authorities interpret any of our conduct as being in violation of applicable health care laws, including fraud and abuse laws, laws prohibiting off-label promotion, disclosure laws or other similar laws, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties.
we are subject to health care fraud and abuse laws, such as the federal false claims act and the anti-kickback provisions of the federal social security act, laws prohibiting off-label product promotion and other similar laws and regulations both in united states and in non-u.s. markets. while we have a corporate compliance program designed to actively identify, prevent and mitigate risk through the implementation of compliance policies and systems and the promotion of a culture of compliance, if we are found not to be in full compliance with these laws our business could be materially harmed.
the federal anti-kickback law prohibits knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the ordering, furnishing, arranging for or recommending of an item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a federal health care program, such as medicare or medicaid. the federal statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, patients, purchasers and formulary managers on the other hand, and therefore constrains our marketing practices and our various service arrangements with physicians, including physicians who make clinical decisions to use our products. although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and courts generally will apply a "one purpose test" and find a violation of the law if any part of the intent in providing the remuneration was to induce referrals, even if it also was intended to compensate for professional services or other legitimate purposes.
federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of alleged promotional and marketing activities, such as providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product; reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then used by federal programs to set reimbursement rates; engaging in promotion for uses that the fda has not approved, known as "off-label" uses, that caused claims to be submitted to medicaid for non-covered off-label uses; submitting inflated "best price" information to the medicaid rebate program; and certain manufacturing-related violations. the scope of this and other laws may expand in ways that make compliance more difficult and expensive.
although physicians are permitted, based on their medical judgment, to prescribe products for indications other than those approved by the fda, manufacturers are prohibited from promoting their products for such off-label uses. we market orkambi and kalydeco to eligible cf patients for whom the applicable product has been approved and provide promotional materials and training programs to physicians regarding the use of orkambi and kalydeco in these patient populations. these eligible patients represent only a portion of the total patients with cf. if the fda determines that our promotional materials, training or other activities constitute off-label promotion, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or other activities, conduct corrective advertising or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions, including the issuance of a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine and criminal penalties. it also is possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they believe that the alleged improper promotion led to the submission and payment of claims for an off-label use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. even if it is later determined we were not in violation of these laws, we may be faced with negative publicity, incur significant expenses defending our actions and have to divert significant management resources from other matters.
also applicable to some of our practices is the health insurance portability and accountability act, or hipaa, and its implementing regulations, which created federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements relating to health care matters and which also imposes certain regulatory and contractual requirements regarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.
in addition to hipaa, numerous other federal and state laws, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. various foreign countries also have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use and transmission of personal information. the legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business. we have in the past relied on adherence to the u.s.-eu safe harbor framework as agreed to and set forth by the u.s. department of commerce and the european union, which established a means for legitimizing the transfer of personal information by u.s. companies doing business in europe from the european economic area to the united states. as a result of a recent opinion of the european union court of justice, the u.s.-eu safe harbor framework is now deemed to be an invalid method of compliance with restrictions regarding the transfer of data outside of the european economic area. while we are engaging in efforts to address the implications of this opinion, we may be unsuccessful in these efforts. failure to comply with laws regarding data protection would expose us to risk of enforcement actions taken by data protection authorities in the european union and the potential for significant penalties if we are found to be non-compliant. even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could harm our business.
in recent years, several states and localities have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state or make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials, health care provider payments and other activities. additionally, as part of the aca, the federal government enacted the physician payment sunshine act provisions. the physician payment sunshine act provisions require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report annually to the secretary of hhs payments or other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals. we also now have similar reporting obligations in certain european countries and the european federation of pharmaceutical industries and associations has adopted a code that will require us to begin reporting such information throughout the european union in 2016. we will also have similar reporting obligations in australia beginning in 2016. we expended significant efforts to establish, and are continuing to devote significant resources to maintain and enhance, systems and processes in order to comply with these regulations. failure to comply with the reporting requirements would result in significant civil monetary penalties. the aca also includes various provisions designed to strengthen significantly fraud and abuse enforcement, such as increased funding for enforcement efforts and the lowering of the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback statute and criminal health care fraud statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it.
on january 1, 2015, the ema adopted a new policy on publication of clinical data whereby it will publish clinical reports submitted as part of maas for drugs. the policy applies to all clinical reports submitted after january 1, 2015 and the reports will be released as soon as a decision on the application has been made by the ema. while implementation of this policy is ongoing and its full effect on our business is not yet known, the ability of third-parties to review and/or analyze the raw data from our clinical trials may increase the risk of patient confidentiality breaches and could result in enhanced scrutiny of our clinical trials results. such scrutiny could result in misconceptions being spread about our drugs and drug candidates, even if the underlying analysis of such review turns out to be flawed. these publications could also result in the disclosure of information to our competitors that we might otherwise deem confidential, which could harm our competitive position.
if our past or present operations are found to be in violation of any such laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from federal health care programs and/or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. the risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are subject to a variety of interpretations. any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against them, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management's attention from the operation of our business.
the sales and marketing practices of our industry have been the subject of increased scrutiny from governmental entities in the united sates and other countries in which we market our products, and we believe that this trend will continue. we have in place policies to govern how we may retain health care professionals as consultants that reflect the current climate on this issue and are providing training on these policies. any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against them, also could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management's attention from the operation of our business.
the increasing use of social media platforms presents new risks and challenges.
social media increasingly is being used by third parties to communicate about our products and drug candidates and the diseases our therapies are designed to treat. we believe that members of the cf community may be more active on social media as compared to other patient populations due to the demographics of this patient population. social media practices in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are evolving, which creates uncertainty and risk of noncompliance with regulations applicable to our business. for example, patients may use social media platforms to comment on the effectiveness of, or adverse experiences with, a drug or a drug candidate, which could result in reporting obligations. in addition, there is a risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us on any social networking website. if any of these events were to occur or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could incur liability, face restrictive regulatory actions or incur other harm to our business.
risks related to development, clinical testing and regulation of our products and drug candidates our drug candidates remain subject to clinical testing and regulatory approval. if we are unable to successfully develop additional drug candidates, and in particular our next-generation cftr combination regimens, our business will be materially harmed.
our business depends upon the successful development and commercialization of drug candidates. these drug candidates are in various stages of development and must satisfy rigorous standards of safety and efficacy before they can be approved for sale by the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. to satisfy these standards, we must allocate resources among our various development programs and must engage in expensive and lengthy testing of our drug candidates. discovery and development efforts for new pharmaceutical products, including new combination therapies, are resource-intensive and may take 10 to 15 years or longer for each drug candidate. despite our efforts, our drug candidates may not:
•   offer therapeutic or other improvement over existing competitive therapies;
•   meet applicable regulatory standards;
•   be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at acceptable costs; or
•   if approved for commercial sale, be successfully marketed as pharmaceutical products.
we have recently completed and/or have ongoing or planned clinical trials for several of our drug candidates, including drug candidates for the treatment of cf, oncology, pain and neurology. the strength of our company's product portfolio and pipeline will depend in large part upon the outcomes of these clinical trials and our ability to develop and commercialize combination treatments for cf that include ivacaftor in combination with (i) vx-661 and/or (ii) our next-generation cftr corrector compounds, including vx-152 and vx-440. results of our clinical trials and findings from our nonclinical studies, including toxicology findings in nonclinical studies conducted concurrently with clinical trials, could lead to abrupt changes in our development activities, including the possible cessation of development activities associated with a particular drug candidate or program. moreover, clinical data are often susceptible of varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their drug candidates performed satisfactorily in clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their drug candidate. furthermore, results from our clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the fda or other regulatory authorities for approval of a drug candidate.
many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including our company, have suffered significant setbacks in later-stage clinical trials even after achieving promising results in earlier-stage clinical trials. accordingly, the results from completed preclinical studies and clinical trials may not be replicated in later clinical trials, and ongoing clinical trials for our drug candidates may not be predictive of the results we may obtain in later-stage clinical trials or of the likelihood of approval of a drug candidate for commercial sale. in addition, from time to time we report interim data from our clinical trials. interim data from a clinical trial may not be predictive of final results from the clinical trial.
if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval, we will be unable to commercialize our drug candidates.
the time required to complete clinical trials and to satisfy the fda and other countries' regulatory review processes is uncertain and typically takes many years. our analysis of data obtained from nonclinical and clinical activities is subject to confirmation and interpretation by regulatory authorities, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. we also may encounter unanticipated delays or increased costs due to government regulation from future legislation or administrative action or changes in governmental policy during the period of drug development, clinical trials and governmental regulatory review.
we may seek a fast track and/or breakthrough therapy designation for some of our drug candidates. for example, ivacaftor was granted fast-track designation in the united states and a number of our drugs and drug candidates, including ivacaftor and the combination regimens of lumacaftor with ivacaftor and vx-661 with ivacaftor, were designated as breakthrough therapies. drug candidates that receive one or both of these designations may be eligible for, among other things, an accelerated regulatory review. each of these designations is within the discretion of the fda. accordingly, even if we believe one of our drug candidates meets the criteria for fast track and/or breakthrough therapy designation, the fda may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. the receipt of one or both of these designations for a drug candidate does not guarantee a faster development process, review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional fda procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the fda. in addition, even if one or more of our drugs or drug candidates qualifies for fast track and/or breakthrough therapy designation, the fda may later decide to withdraw such designation if it determines that the drug or drug candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification.
any failure to obtain regulatory approvals for a drug candidate would prevent us from commercializing that drug candidate. any delay in obtaining required regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our ability to successfully commercialize a drug candidate. furthermore, any regulatory approval to market a drug may be subject to limitations that we do not expect on the indicated uses for which we may market the drug. any such limitations could reduce the size of the market for the drug.
we also are subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing authorization, pricing and third-party reimbursement. non-u.s. jurisdictions have different approval procedures than those required by the fda, and these jurisdictions may impose additional testing requirements for our drug candidates. the foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with the fda approval process described above, as well as risks attributable to the satisfaction of foreign requirements. approval by the fda does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities outside the united states and approval by a foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by the fda. in addition, although the fda may accept data from clinical trials conducted outside the united states, acceptance of this data is subject to conditions imposed by the fda. for example, the clinical trial must be well designed and conducted and performed by qualified investigators in accordance with ethical principles. the trial population also must adequately represent the u.s. population, and the data must be applicable to the u.s. population and u.s. medical practice in ways that the fda deems clinically meaningful. in addition, while these clinical trials are subject to the applicable local laws, fda acceptance of the data will depend on its determination that the trials also complied with all applicable u.s. laws and regulations. if the fda does not accept the data from any trial that we conduct outside the united states, it would likely result in the need for additional trials, which would be costly and time-consuming and delay or permanently halt our development of the applicable drug candidate.
if clinical trials are prolonged or delayed, our development timelines for the affected development program could be extended, our costs to develop the drug candidate could increase and the competitive position of the drug candidate could be adversely affected.
we cannot predict whether or not we will encounter problems with any of our completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials that will cause us or regulatory authorities to delay or suspend clinical trials, or delay the analysis of data from our completed or ongoing clinical trials. among the factors that could delay our development programs are:
•   ongoing discussions with the fda or comparable foreign authorities regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials and the number of clinical trials we must conduct;
•   delays in enrolling volunteers or patients into clinical trials, including as a result of low numbers of patients that meet the eligibility criteria for the trial;
•   the need to repeat clinical trials as a result of inconclusive results, unforeseen complications in testing or clinical investigator error;
•   inadequate supply or deficient quality of drug candidate materials or other materials necessary for the conduct of our clinical trials;
•   unfavorable fda or foreign regulatory authority inspection and review of a manufacturing facility that supplied clinical trial materials or its relevant manufacturing records or a clinical trial site or records of any clinical or preclinical investigation;
•   serious and unexpected drug-related side-effects experienced by participants in our clinical trials or by participants in clinical trials being conducted by our competitors to evaluate drug candidates with similar mechanisms of action or structures to drug candidates that we are developing;
•   favorable results in testing of our competitors' drug candidates, or fda or foreign regulatory authority approval of our competitors' drug candidates; or
•   action by the fda or a foreign regulatory authority to place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on a trial or compound or deeming the clinical trial conduct as problematic.
our ability to enroll patients in our clinical trials in sufficient numbers and on a timely basis is subject to a number of factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the availability of effective treatments for the relevant disease, the number of other clinical trials ongoing and competing for patients in the same indication and the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial. in addition, patients may drop out of our clinical trials or may be lost to follow-up medical evaluation after treatment ends, and this could impair the validity or statistical significance of the trials. delays in patient enrollment or unforeseen drop-out rates may result in increased costs and longer development times.
we, our collaborators, the fda or other applicable regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials of a drug candidate at any time if we or they believe the healthy volunteers or patients participating in such clinical trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or for other reasons. for example, in july 2013, the fda placed a partial clinical hold on vx-135, a drug candidate we were developing for the treatment of patients with hepatitis c virus infection. any such suspension could materially adversely affect the development of a particular drug candidate and our business.
if our processes and systems are not compliant with regulatory requirements, we could be subject to restrictions on marketing our products or could be delayed in submitting regulatory filings seeking approvals for our drug candidates.
we have a number of regulated processes and systems that are required to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our drugs and drug candidates. these processes and systems are subject to continual review and periodic inspection by the fda and other regulatory bodies. in addition, the clinical research organizations and other third parties that we work with in our non-clinical studies and clinical trials and our oversight of such parties are subject to similar reviews and periodic inspection by the fda and other regulatory bodies. if compliance issues are identified at any point in the development and approval process, we may experience delays in filing for regulatory approval for our drug candidates, or delays in obtaining regulatory approval after filing. any later discovery of previously unknown problems or safety issues with approved drugs or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in restrictions on such drugs or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of drugs from the market, the imposition of civil or criminal penalties or a refusal by the fda and/or other regulatory bodies to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new drugs or supplements to approved applications, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. in addition, we are a party to agreements that transfer responsibility for complying with specified regulatory requirements, such as filing and maintenance of marketing authorizations and safety reporting or compliance with manufacturing requirements, to our collaborators and third-party manufacturers. if our collaborators or third-party manufacturers do not fulfill these regulatory obligations, any drugs for which we or they obtain approval may be subject to later restrictions on manufacturing or sale, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
risks related to collaborations and other business development activities our ability to execute on our long-term strategy depends in part on our ability to acquire rights to additional drugs, drug candidates and other technologies that have the potential to add to our pipeline or provide us with new commercial opportunities.
in order to achieve our long-term business objectives, our strategy is to supplement our internal pipeline by acquiring rights to additional drugs, drug candidates and other technologies that have the potential to provide us with new commercial opportunities. we may not be able to acquire, in-license or otherwise obtain rights to additional drugs, drug candidates or other technologies on acceptable terms or at all. we have faced and will continue to face significant competition for these types of drugs, drug candidates and other technologies from a variety of other companies with interests in the specialty pharmaceutical marketplace, many of which have significantly more financial resources and experience in business development activities than we have. in addition, non-profit organizations may be willing to provide capital to the companies that control additional drugs, drug candidates or technologies, which may provide incentives for companies to advance these drugs, drug candidates or technologies independently. because of these competitive pressures, the cost of acquiring, in-licensing or otherwise obtaining rights to such drugs, drug candidates or other technologies has grown dramatically in recent years and may be at levels that we cannot afford or that we believe are not justified by market potential. this competition is most intense for approved drugs and late-stage drug candidates, which have the lowest risk and would have the most immediate effect on our financial performance.
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of potential acquisitions or licenses to businesses, drugs, drug candidates and other technologies, and the integration following any such acquisition or license may disrupt our business and management.
we may acquire a business or the rights to drugs, drug candidates or other technologies. for example, in 2015, we entered into a collaboration with parion pursuant to which we exclusively licensed investigational enac inhibitors, including vx-371 (formerly p-1037), for the potential treatment of cf and other pulmonary diseases. we also entered into an agreement with crispr to collaborate on the discovery and development of potential new treatments aimed at the underlying genetic causes of human diseases using crispr-cas9 gene editing technology. with respect to each of these transactions and any additional acquisition of a business or rights to drugs, drug candidates or other technologies, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such transaction, each of which involves numerous risks. these risks include:
•   failure to successfully further develop the acquired or licensed drugs or technology or to achieve strategic objectives, including successfully developing and commercializing the drugs, drug candidates or technologies that we acquire or license;
•   inadequate or unfavorable data from clinical trials evaluating the acquired or licensed drug or drug candidates;
•   entry into markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience or where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions;
•   disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and employees from other opportunities and challenges;
•   potential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired company, or acquired or licensed product or technology, including but not limited to, problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges with respect to intellectual property, product quality, safety, accounting practices, employee, customer or third party relations and other known and unknown liabilities;
•   liability for activities of the acquired company or licensor before the acquisition or license, including intellectual property infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities;
•   exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of an acquisition or license, including but not limited to, claims from terminated employees, customers, former equity holders or other third-parties;
•   difficulty in integrating the drugs, drug candidates, technologies, business operations and personnel of an acquired company; and
•   difficulties in the integration of the acquired company's departments, systems, including accounting, human resource and other administrative systems, technologies, books and records, and procedures, as well as in maintaining uniform standards, controls, including internal control over financial reporting required by the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 and related procedures and policies.
acquisitions and licensing arrangements are inherently risky, and ultimately, if we do not complete an announced acquisition or license transaction or integrate an acquired business, or an acquired or licensed drug, drug candidate or other technology successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition or license to the extent anticipated and the perception of the effectiveness of our management team and our company may suffer in the marketplace. additionally, we may later incur impairment charges related to assets acquired in any such transaction. for example, we acquired or licensed several drug candidates for the treatment of hcv infection, but due to adverse clinical data regarding these drug candidates and competitive pressures, we incurred significant costs and impairment charges but did not realize the expected benefits from these transactions. in addition, even if we achieve the long-term benefits associated with strategic transactions, our expenses and short-term costs may increase materially and adversely affect our liquidity and short-term net income (loss). future licenses or acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, the creation of contingent liabilities, impairment expenses related to goodwill, and impairment or amortization expenses related to other intangible assets, which could harm our financial condition.
we face risks in connection with existing and future collaborations with respect to the development, manufacture and commercialization of our products and drug candidates.
the risks that we face in connection with our current collaborations, including with parion and crispr, and any future collaborations include the following:
•   our collaborators may change the focus of their development and commercialization efforts or may have insufficient resources to effectively develop our drug candidates. the ability of some of our products and drug candidates to reach their potential could be limited if collaborators decrease or fail to increase development or commercialization efforts related to those products or drug candidates. our collaboration agreements provide our collaborators with a level of discretion in determining the amount and timing of efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations.
•   any future collaboration agreements may have the effect of limiting the areas of research and development that we may pursue, either alone or in collaboration with third parties.
•   collaborators may develop and commercialize, either alone or with others, drugs that are similar to or competitive with the drugs or drug candidates that are the subject of their collaborations with us.
•   disagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development, might cause delays or termination of the research, development or commercialization of drug candidates, might lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to drug candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration. any such disagreements would divert management attention and resources and be time-consuming and expensive.
•   collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation.
•   collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability.
•   investigations and/or compliance or enforcement actions against a collaborator, which may expose us to indirect liability as a result of our partnership with such collaborator.
additionally, if a collaborator were to be involved in a business combination, it might deemphasize or terminate the development or commercialization of any drug candidate licensed to it by us. if one of our collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may find it more difficult to attract new collaborators and our perception in the business and financial communities could be harmed.
we may not be able to attract collaborators or external funding for the development and commercialization of certain of our drug candidates.
as part of our ongoing strategy, we may seek additional collaborative arrangements or external funding for certain of our development programs and/or seek to expand existing collaborations to cover additional commercialization and/or development activities. we have a number of research programs and early-stage clinical development programs, some of which are being developed in collaboration with a third party. for example, in june 2014, we granted janssen pharmaceuticals, inc. an exclusive license to develop and commercialize vx-787, a drug candidate discovered by us for the treatment of influenza. at any time, we may determine that in order to continue development of a drug candidate or program or successfully commercialize a drug we need to identify a collaborator or amend or expand an existing collaboration. whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator's resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator's evaluation of a number of factors. those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the fda or similar regulatory authorities outside the united states, the potential market for the subject drug candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such drug candidate to patients, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of the applicable intellectual property, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge, and industry and market conditions generally. potentially, and depending on the circumstances, we may desire that a collaborator either agree to fund portions of a drug development program led by us, or agree to provide all of the funding and directly lead the development and commercialization of a program. no assurance can be given that any efforts we make to seek additional collaborative arrangements will be successfully completed on a timely basis or at all. if we elect to fund and undertake development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. if we are unable to enter into acceptable collaborative relationships, one or more of our development programs could be delayed or terminated and the possibility of our receiving a return on our investment in the program could be impaired.
risks related to third-party manufacturing and reliance on third parties we depend on third-party manufacturers to manufacture our products and the materials we require for our clinical trials. we may not be able to maintain these relationships and could experience supply disruptions outside of our control.
we rely on a worldwide network of third-party manufacturers and in rare circumstances, compounders, to manufacture some of our drugs for commercial use and our drug candidates for clinical trials. as a result of our reliance on these third-party manufacturers and suppliers, we could be subject to significant supply disruptions outside of our control. our supply chain for sourcing raw materials and manufacturing drug product ready for distribution is a multi-step international endeavor. third-party contract manufacturers, including some in china, supply us with raw materials, and convert these raw materials into drug substance and convert the drug substance into final dosage form. establishing and managing this global supply chain requires a significant financial commitment and the creation and maintenance of numerous third-party contractual relationships. although we attempt to manage the business relationships with companies in our supply chain, we do not have control over their operations. supply disruptions may result from a number of factors, including shortages in product raw materials, labor or technical difficulties, regulatory inspections or restrictions, shipping or customs delays or any other performance failure by any third-party manufacturer on which we rely. any supply disruptions could disrupt sales of our products and/or the timing of our clinical trials.
we require a supply of ivacaftor and lumacaftor for commercial sale (as kalydeco and/or orkambi). we also require a supply of ivacaftor, lumacaftor, vx-661, vx-371, vx-152 and vx-440 and our other drug candidates for use in our clinical trials. we obtain ivacaftor and lumacaftor (and the combinations thereof) to meet our commercial and clinical supply needs through a third-party manufacturing network. our supply chain includes a single-source manufacturer for (i) one step in the ivacaftor manufacturing process and (ii) the manufacture of the oral granule formulation of kalydeco that is used for patients with cf two to five years of age. as a result, if these manufacturers become unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing product on our behalf and we are not able to promptly identify another manufacturer, we would experience a disruption in the commercial supply of kalydeco and/or orkambi, which would have a significant effect on patients, our business and our product revenues. similarly, a disruption in the clinical supply of drug products could delay the completion of clinical trials and affect timelines for regulatory filings. there can be no assurance that we will be able to establish and maintain secondary manufacturers for all of our ivacaftor or lumacaftor supply needs on a timely basis or at all.
in the course of providing its services, a contract manufacturer may develop process technology related to the manufacture of our products or drug candidates that the manufacturer owns, either independently or jointly with us. this would increase our reliance on that manufacturer or require us to obtain a license from that manufacturer in order to have our products or drug candidates manufactured by other suppliers utilizing the same process.
we rely on third parties to conduct certain pre-clinical work and clinical trials, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet established deadlines for the completion of such studies and/or trials or failing to satisfy regulatory requirements.
we rely on third parties such as contract research organizations to help manage certain pre-clinical work and our clinical trials and on medical institutions and clinical investigators to enroll qualified patients and conduct our clinical trials. our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities but does not relieve us of our responsibilities. for example, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the clinical trial. moreover, the fda requires us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as good laboratory practices and good clinical practices for conducting, recording and reporting the results of pre-clinical and clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. if these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be required to replace them. although we believe that there are a number of other third-party contractors we could engage to continue these activities, it may result in a delay of the affected clinical trial or drug development program. if clinical trials are not conducted in accordance with our contractual expectations or regulatory requirements, action by regulatory authorities might significantly and adversely affect the conduct or progress of these clinical trials or in specific circumstances might result in a requirement that a clinical trial be redone. accordingly, our efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for and commercialize our drug candidates could be delayed.
risks related to intellectual property if our patents do not protect our drugs, or our drugs infringe third-party patents, we could be subject to litigation and substantial liabilities.
we have numerous issued patents and pending patent applications in the united states, as well as counterparts in other countries. our success will depend, in significant part, on our ability to obtain and defend u.s. and foreign patents covering our drugs, their uses and our processes, to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. we cannot be certain that any patents will issue from our pending patent applications or, even if patents issue or have issued, that the issued claims will provide us with adequate protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable.
due to evolving legal standards relating to the patentability, validity and enforceability of patents covering pharmaceutical inventions and the scope of claims made under these patents, our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce patents is uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. recent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents in the u.s. the leahy-smith america invents act, or the leahy-smith act, includes a number of significant changes to united states patent law. these include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. the united states patent office developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the leahy-smith act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the leahy-smith act, and in particular, the first to file provisions, only became effective in march 2013. the first to file provisions limit the rights of an inventor who is the first to invent an invention but is not the first to file an application claiming that invention. u.s. and foreign patent applications typically are maintained in confidence for a period of time after they initially are filed with the applicable patent office. consequently, we cannot be certain that we were the first to invent, or the first to file patent applications on, our products or drug candidates or their use. if a third party also has filed a u.s. patent application relating to our drugs or drug candidates, their uses, or a similar invention, we may have to participate in legal or administrative proceedings to determine priority of invention. for applications governed by the lahey-smith act, if a third-party has an earlier filed u.s. patent application relating to our drugs or drug candidates, their uses, or a similar invention, we may be unable to obtain an issued patent from our application.
the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability. our patents may be challenged by third parties, resulting in the patent being deemed invalid, unenforceable or narrowed in scope, or the third party may circumvent any such issued patents. also, our pending patent applications may not issue, and we may not receive any additional patents. our patents might not contain claims that are sufficiently broad to prevent others from utilizing our technologies. for instance, the issued patents relating to our drugs or drug candidates may be limited to a particular molecule or molecules and may not cover similar molecules that have similar clinical properties. consequently, our competitors may independently develop competing products that do not infringe our patents or other intellectual property. in addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future products.
the laws of many foreign jurisdictions do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the united states and many companies in our segment of the pharmaceutical industry have encountered significant difficulties in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. if we encounter such difficulties in protecting or are otherwise precluded from effectively protecting our intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions, our business could be substantially harmed.
because of the extensive time required for the discovery, development, testing and regulatory review of drug candidates, it is possible that, a patent may expire before a drug candidate can be commercialized, or a patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization of such drug candidate resulting in a minimal, if any, period of patent exclusivity. to the extent our drug candidates are not commercialized significantly ahead of the expiration date of any applicable patent, or to the extent we have no patent protection on such drug candidates, then, to the extent available we would rely on other forms of exclusivity, such as regulatory exclusivity provided by the fdca and its counterpart agencies in various jurisdictions, and/or orphan drug exclusivity.
uncertainty over intellectual property in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry has been the source of litigation and other disputes, which is inherently costly and unpredictable.
there is considerable uncertainty within our industry about the validity, scope and enforceability of many issued patents in the united states and elsewhere in the world, and, to date, the law and practice remains in substantial flux both in the agencies that grant patents and in the courts. we cannot currently determine the ultimate scope and validity of patents which may be granted to third parties in the future or which patents might be asserted as being infringed by the manufacture, use and sale of our products.
there has been, and we expect that there may continue to be, significant litigation in the industry regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. litigation, arbitrations, administrative proceedings and other legal actions with private parties and governmental authorities concerning patents and other intellectual property rights may be protracted, expensive and distracting to management. competitors may sue us as a way of delaying the introduction of our drugs or to remove our drugs from the market. any litigation, including litigation related to abbreviated new drug applications, or anda, interference proceedings to determine priority of inventions, derivations proceedings, inter partes review, oppositions to patents in foreign countries, litigation against our collaborators or similar actions, may be costly and time consuming and could harm our business. we expect that litigation may be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our proprietary rights. litigation may be necessary in other instances to determine the validity, scope or non-infringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our products. ultimately, the outcome of such litigation could adversely affect the validity and scope of our patent or other proprietary rights, hinder our ability to manufacture and market our products, or result in the assessment of significant monetary damages against us that may exceed amounts, if any, accrued in our financial statements.
to the extent that valid present or future third-party patents or other intellectual property rights cover our drugs, drug candidates or technologies, we or our strategic collaborators may seek licenses or other agreements from the holders of such rights in order to avoid or settle legal claims. such licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, which may hinder our ability to, or prevent us from being able to, manufacture and market our drugs. payments under any licenses that we are able to obtain would reduce our profits derived from the covered products.
many of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee's former employer. litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.
in addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. our and their assignment agreements may not be self-executing or may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.
if we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.
risks related to our operations if we fail to manage our operations effectively, our business may suffer.
we have expanded and are continuing to expand our global operations and capabilities, which has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our management and our operational, research and development and financial infrastructure. to effectively manage our business, we need to:
•   implement and clearly communicate our corporate-wide strategies;
•   enhance our operational and financial infrastructure, including our controls over records and information;
•   enhance our operational, financial and management processes, including our cross-functional decision-making processes and our budget prioritization systems;
•   transition from a u.s.-centric company into an organization capable of developing and commercializing multiple drug candidates in international markets; and
•   enhance our compliance and legal resources.
risks associated with operating in foreign countries could materially adversely affect our business.
we have expanded our international operations over the past several years in order to market kalydeco and orkambi and expand our research and development capabilities. in 2015, a substantial portion of our revenues and expenses were associated with our foreign operations and we expect that portion to increase over time. new laws and industry codes in the european union and elsewhere have expanded transparency requirements regarding payments and transfers of value as well as patient-level clinical trial data. new laws in the european union also have expanded protections related to personal data and provided for increased sanctions for violations. collectively, our expansion and these new requirements are adding to our compliance costs and expose us to potential sanctions for failing to meet the enhanced safeguards and reporting demands in these jurisdictions. in addition, a significant portion of our commercial supply chain, including sourcing of raw materials and manufacturing, is located in china and the european union. consequently, we are, and will continue to be, subject to risks related to operating in foreign countries. risks associated with conducting operations in foreign countries include:
•   differing regulatory requirements for drug approvals and regulation of approved drugs in foreign countries;
•   collectibility of accounts receivable;
•   unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;
•   economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;
•   differing levels of enforcement and/or recognition of contractual and intellectual property rights;
•   complying with local laws and regulations, which are interpreted and enforced differently across jurisdictions and which can change significantly over time;
•   foreign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;
•   foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in reduced revenues or increased operating expenses, and other obligations incident to doing business or operating in another country;
•   workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the united states;
•   import and export licensing requirements, tariffs, and other trade and travel restrictions;
•   production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and
•   business interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism.
our revenues are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to the global nature of our operations. although we have foreign currency forward contracts to hedge forecasted product revenues denominated in foreign currencies, our efforts to reduce currency exchange losses may not be successful. as a result, currency fluctuations among our reporting currency, the u.s. dollar, and the currencies in which we do business will affect our operating results, often in unpredictable ways.
in addition, our international operations are subject to regulation under u.s. law. for example, the foreign corrupt practices act prohibits u.s. companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad. in many countries, the health care professionals we regularly interact with may meet the definition of a foreign government official for purposes of the foreign corrupt practices act. we also are subject to import/export control laws. failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences, including the possible delay in approval or refusal to approve a product, recalls, seizures, withdrawal of an approved product from the market, the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions, the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations and corresponding bad publicity and negative perception of our company in foreign countries.
our business has a substantial risk of product liability claims. if we do not obtain appropriate levels of insurance, product liability claims could adversely affect our business.
our business exposes us to significant potential product liability risks that are inherent in the development, clinical testing, manufacturing and sales and marketing of drugs and drug candidates. we have product liability insurance and clinical trial insurance in amounts that we believe are adequate to cover this risk. however, our insurance may not provide adequate coverage against all potential liabilities. if a claim is brought against us, we might be required to pay legal and other expenses to defend the claim, as well as pay uncovered damage awards resulting from a claim brought successfully against us and these damages could be significant and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. furthermore, whether or not we are ultimately successful in defending any such claims, we might be required to direct significant financial and managerial resources to such defense and adverse publicity is likely to result.
a breakdown or breach of our information technology systems could subject us to liability or interrupt the operation of our business.
we maintain and rely extensively on information technology systems and network infrastructures for the effective operation of our business. in the course of our business, we collect, store and transmit confidential information (including personal information and intellectual property), and it is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information. the size and complexity of our information technology and information security systems makes such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches. a disruption, infiltration or failure of our information technology systems or any of our data centers as a result of software or hardware malfunctions, computer viruses, cyber attacks, employee theft or misuse, power disruptions, natural disasters, floods or accidents could cause breaches of data security and loss of critical data, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business and subject us to both private and governmental causes of action. while we have implemented security measures in an attempt to minimize these risks to our data and information technology systems and have adopted a business continuity plan to deal with a disruption to our information technology systems, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business.
if we fail to attract and retain skilled employees, our business could be materially harmed.
because our drug discovery and development activities are highly technical in nature, we require the services of highly qualified and trained scientists who have the skills necessary to conduct these activities. in addition, we need to attract and retain employees with experience in marketing and commercialization of medicines. we face intense competition for our personnel from our competitors and other companies throughout our industry. we also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. moreover, the growth of local biotechnology companies and the expansion of major pharmaceutical companies into the boston area have increased competition for the available pool of skilled employees, especially in technical fields, and the high cost of living in massachusetts makes it difficult to attract employees from other parts of the country to massachusetts. our ability to commercialize our products, and achieve our research and development objectives, depends on our ability to respond effectively to these demands. if we are unable to hire and retain qualified personnel, there could be a material adverse effect on our business.
the loss of the services of key employees or the failure to effectively integrate key employees could negatively affect our business.
our future success will depend in large part on our ability to retain the services of our key scientific and management personnel and to integrate new scientific and management personnel into our business. a loss of key personnel or a failure to properly integrate new personnel could be disruptive. we have entered into employment agreements with some executives and provide compensation-related benefits to all of our key employees that vest over time and therefore induce them to remain with us. however, the employment agreements can be terminated by the executive on relatively short notice. the value to employees of stock-related benefits that vest over time-such as options, restricted stock and restricted stock units-is significantly affected by movements in our stock price, and may at any point in time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies. a failure to retain, as well as hire, train and effectively integrate into our organization a sufficient number of qualified scientists, professionals, sales personnel and senior management would negatively affect our business.
if we do not comply with laws regulating the protection of the environment and health and human safety, our business could be adversely affected.
our research and development efforts involve the regulated use of hazardous materials, chemicals and various controlled and radioactive compounds. although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by state, federal and foreign regulations, the risk of loss of, or accidental contamination or injury from, these materials cannot be eliminated. if an accident occurs, we could be held liable for resulting damages, which could be substantial. we also are subject to numerous environmental, health and workplace safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne pathogens and the handling of biohazardous materials. although we maintain workers' compensation insurance to cover us for costs we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of these materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. we maintain insurance to cover pollution conditions or other extraordinary or unanticipated events relating to our use and disposal of hazardous materials that we believe is appropriate based on the small amount of hazardous materials we generate. additional federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting our operations may be adopted in the future. we may incur substantial costs to comply with, and substantial fines or penalties if we violate, any of these laws or regulations.
if our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, our operations would be seriously harmed.
most of our operations, including our research and development activities, are conducted in a limited number of facilities. if any of our major facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, due to a fire, earthquake or similar event, our operations could be seriously harmed. for example, our corporate headquarters, as well as additional leased space that we use for certain logistical and laboratory operations and manufacturing, are located in a flood zone along the massachusetts coast. we have adopted a business continuity plan to address most events of a crisis nature. however, if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans, we may experience delays in recovery of data and/or an inability to perform vital corporate functions, which could result in a significant disruption in our research, development, manufacturing and/or commercial activities, the loss or critical data and/or large expenses to repair or replace the facility, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.
market prices for securities of companies such as ours are highly volatile. from january 1, 2015 to december 31, 2015, our common stock traded between $97.45 and $143.45 per share. the market for our stock, like that of other companies in the biotechnology industry, has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. the future market price of our securities could be significantly and adversely affected by factors such as:
•   the information contained in our quarterly earnings releases, including our net product revenues and operating expenses for completed periods and guidance regarding future periods;
•   announcements of fda actions with respect to our drugs or our competitors' drugs, or regulatory filings for our drug candidates or those of our competitors, or announcements of interim or final results of clinical trials or nonclinical studies relating to our drugs, drug candidates or those of our competitors;
•   prescription data and other information disclosed by third parties regarding our business or products;
•   technological innovations or the introduction of new drugs by our competitors;
•   government regulatory action;
•   public concern as to the safety of drugs developed by us or our competitors;
•   developments in patent or other intellectual property rights or announcements relating to these matters;
•   developments in domestic and international governmental policy or regulation, for example, relating to intellectual property rights;
•   developments relating specifically to other companies and market conditions for pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks or stocks in general;
•   business development, capital structuring or financing activities; and
•   general worldwide or national economic, political and capital market conditions.
our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, and the terms of our credit agreement impose restrictions on our business, reducing our operational flexibility and creating default risks.
in july 2014, we entered into a credit agreement that provides for a $300.0 million senior secured term loan. we are required to repay principal on the loan beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 with us repaying $75.0 million on each of october 1, 2016, january 1, 2017, april 1, 2017 and july 9, 2017.
our indebtedness could have important consequences to our business, including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse financial, business, economic and industry conditions, as well as other factors that are beyond our control. in october 2016, we will be required to begin repayment of the principal amount of our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of future cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes.
the credit agreement requires that we maintain, on a quarterly basis, a minimum level of kalydeco net revenues. further, the credit agreement includes negative covenants, subject to exceptions, restricting or limiting our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, engage in certain investment, acquisition and disposition transactions, pay dividends, repurchase capital stock and enter into transactions with affiliates. as a result, we may be restricted from engaging in business activities that may otherwise improve our business. failure to comply with the covenants could result in an event of default that could trigger acceleration of our indebtedness, which would require us to repay all amounts owing under the credit agreement and/or our capital leases and could have a material adverse effect on our business.
additionally, our obligations under the credit agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries. all obligations under the credit agreement, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured, subject to certain exceptions, by substantially all of our assets and the assets of all guarantors, including the pledge of all or a portion of the equity interests of certain of our subsidiaries. if we fail to satisfy our obligations under the credit agreement or are unable to obtain sufficient funds to make payments, the lenders could foreclose on our pledged collateral.
our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past, and we expect that they will continue to do so in the future. our future revenues will be dependent on the level of net product revenues from sales of orkambi, which is reliant on the number of patients for whom treatment with orkambi is initiated, the proportion of initiated patients who remain on treatment, patient compliance with the recommended treatment regimen and the level of rebates, chargebacks, discounts and other adjustments to our orkambi gross product revenues. additional factors that have caused quarterly fluctuations in recent years include variable amounts of revenues, impairment charges, charges for excess and obsolete inventories, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments and the consolidation or deconsolidation of variable interest entities. we cannot accurately predict our future net product revenues from orkambi and our total net product revenues could vary on a quarterly basis. our total net product revenues may be affected by, among other factors, the timing of orders from our significant customers. our revenues also are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to the global nature of our operations. although we have foreign currency forward contracts to hedge forecasted product revenues denominated in foreign currencies, our efforts to reduce currency exchange losses may not be successful. as a result, currency fluctuations among our reporting currency, the u.s. dollar, and the currencies in which we do business may affect our operating results, often in unpredictable ways. our quarterly results also could be materially affected by significant charges, which may or may not be similar to charges we have experienced in the past. most of our operating expenses relate to our research and development activities, do not vary directly with the amount of revenues and are difficult to adjust in the short term. as a result, if revenues in a particular quarter are below expectations, we are unlikely to reduce operating expenses proportionately for that quarter. these examples are only illustrative and other risks, including those discussed in these "risk factors," could also cause fluctuations in our reported financial results. our operating results during any one period do not necessarily suggest the results of future periods.
we expect that results from our clinical development activities and the clinical development activities of our competitors will continue to be released periodically, and may result in significant volatility in the price of our common stock.
any new information regarding our products and drug candidates or competitive products or potentially competitive drug candidates can substantially affect investors' perceptions regarding our future prospects. we, our collaborators and our competitors periodically provide updates regarding drug development programs, typically through press releases, conference calls and presentations at medical conferences. these periodic updates often include interim or final results from clinical trials conducted by us or our competitors and/or information about our or our competitors' expectations regarding regulatory filings and submissions as well as future clinical development of our products or drug candidates, competitive products or potentially competitive drug candidates. the timing of the release of information by us regarding our drug development programs is often beyond our control and is influenced by the timing of receipt of data from our clinical trials and by the general preference among pharmaceutical companies to disclose clinical data during medical conferences. in addition, the information disclosed about our clinical trials, or our competitors' clinical trials, may be based on interim rather than final data that may involve interpretation difficulties and may in any event not accurately predict final results.
we could be negatively affected by securities class action complaints.
on may 28, 2014, a purported shareholder class action local no. 8 ibew retirement plan & trust v. vertex pharmaceuticals incorporated, et al. was filed in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts, naming us and certain of our current and former officers and directors as defendants. the lawsuit alleged that we made material misrepresentations and/or omissions of material fact in our disclosures during the period from may 7, 2012 through may 29, 2012, all in violation of section 10(b) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, and rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. the purported class consists of all persons (excluding defendants) who purchased our common stock between may 7, 2012 and may 29, 2012. the plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages, costs and attorneys' fees as well as disgorgement of the proceeds from certain individual defendants' sales of our stock. on october 8, 2014, the court approved local no. 8 ibew retirement fund as lead plaintiff, and scott and scott llp as lead counsel for the plaintiff and the putative class. we filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on december 8, 2014 and the plaintiffs filed their opposition to our motion to dismiss on january 22, 2015. on february 23, 2015, we filed a reply to the plaintiffs' opposition to our motion to dismiss.  the court heard oral argument on our motion to dismiss on march 6, 2015 and took the motion under advisement. on september 30, 2015, the court granted our motion to dismiss. on october 15, 2015, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal.
we believe that this action is without merit and intend to vigorously defend the litigation. this action will take time and money to defend and may distract us from more productive activities. no assurance can be provided that we will be successful in defending this claim or that insurance proceeds will be sufficient to cover any liability under such claims.
we could be negatively affected by government investigations.
in the third quarter of 2015, we received a subpoena from the united states department of justice related to our marketed medicines. this subpoena requests documents relating primarily to our good laboratory practices in a bioanalytical laboratory. we are in the process of responding to the subpoena and intend to continue to cooperate. if we are unable to resolve this matter in a satisfactory manner, our business could be adversely affected.
changes in tax laws, regulations and treaties could affect our future taxable income.
a change in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation, of any country in which we operate could materially affect us if we generate taxable income in a future period. we continue to assess the impact of various tax reform proposals and modifications to existing tax treaties in all jurisdictions where we have operations to determine the potential effect on our business and any assumptions we have made about our future taxable income. we cannot predict whether any specific proposals will be enacted, the terms of any such proposals or what effect, if any, such proposals would have on our business if they were to be enacted.
we may need to raise additional capital that may not be available.
we have a history of operating losses and may in the future need to raise additional capital. we have borrowed $300.0 million under a credit agreement that we entered into in the third quarter of 2014. in recent periods, we also have received significant proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee benefit plans, but the amount and timing of future proceeds from employee benefits plans is uncertain. any potential public offering, private placement or debt financing may or may not be similar to the transactions that we entered into in the past. any debt financing may be on terms that, among other things, include conversion features that could result in dilution to our then-existing security holders and restrict our ability to pay interest and dividends-although we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. additionally, our pledge of our assets as collateral to secure our obligations under our credit agreement may limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing. any equity financings would result in dilution to our then-existing security holders. if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be required to curtail significantly or discontinue one or more of our research, drug discovery or development programs, including clinical trials, incur significant cash exit costs, or attempt to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies, drugs or drug candidates. based on many factors, including general economic conditions, additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.
issuances of additional shares of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline.
as of december 31, 2015, we had 246.3 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding. as of december 31, 2015, we also had outstanding options to purchase 11.1 million shares of common stock with a weighted-average exercise price of $75.99 per share. outstanding vested options are likely to be exercised if the market price of our common stock exceeds the applicable exercise price, and, in the future, we expect to issue additional options, restricted stock and restricted stock units to directors and employees. in addition, we may issue additional common stock or restricted securities in the future as part of financing activities or business development activities and any such issuances may have a dilutive effect on our then-existing shareholders. sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the open market, or the availability of such shares for sale, could adversely affect the price of our common stock. the issuance of restricted common stock or common stock upon exercise of any outstanding options would be dilutive, and may cause the market price for a share of our common stock to decline.
we have adopted anti-takeover provisions and are subject to massachusetts corporate laws that may frustrate any attempt to remove or replace our current management or effectuate a business combination involving vertex.
our corporate charter and by-law provisions and massachusetts state laws may discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change of control of vertex that might be beneficial to us or our security holders. our charter provides for staggered terms for the members of the board of directors. our by-laws grant the directors a right to adjourn annual meetings of shareholders, and certain provisions of our by-laws may be amended only with an 80% shareholder vote. we may issue shares of any class or series of preferred stock in the future without shareholder approval and upon such terms as our board of directors may determine. the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any class or series of preferred stock that may be issued in the future. massachusetts state law prohibits us from engaging in specified business combinations, unless the combination is approved or consummated in a prescribed manner, and prohibits voting by any shareholder who acquires 20% or more of our voting stock without shareholder approval. as a result, shareholders or other parties may find it more difficult to remove or replace our current management. additionally, one of our collaboration agreements includes a change in control provision that could reduce the potential acquisition price an acquirer is willing to pay or discourage a takeover attempt that may otherwise be viewed as beneficial to shareholders.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are in the business of discovering, developing, manufacturing and commercializing medicines for serious diseases. we use precision medicine approaches with the goal of creating transformative medicines for patients in specialty markets. our business is focused on developing and commercializing therapies for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, or cf, and advancing our research and development programs in other indications, while maintaining our financial strength. our two marketed products are orkambi and kalydeco.
in 2012, we obtained approval for, and initiated commercial sales of, kalydeco (ivacaftor), and in 2015, we obtained approval for, and initiated commercial sales of orkabmi (lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor). kalydeco net product revenues have been increasing on an annual basis and orkambi net product revenues commenced in the united states in the second half of 2015. our total net product revenues increased by 105% from $487.8 million in 2014 to $1.0 billion in 2015, primarily due to orkambi net product revenues, which commenced in the third quarter of 2015, and an increase in kalydeco net product revenues. in the fourth quarter of 2015, our total net product revenues were $406.6 million, including $219.9 million in orkambi net product revenues and $180.7 million in kalydeco net product revenues. we expect our net income (loss) and total net product revenues in 2016 will be largely dependent on our orkambi net product revenues in the united states.
cystic fibrosis orkambi orkambi (lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor) was approved by the united states food and drug administration, or fda, in july 2015 and by the european commission in november 2015, for the treatment of patients with cf twelve years of age and older who are homozygous for the f508del mutation in their cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, or cftr, gene. we recognized our first net product revenues from orkambi in the second half of 2015. our future orkambi net product revenues in the united states will reflect the number of patients for whom treatment with orkambi is initiated, the proportion of initiated patients who remain on treatment, patient compliance with the recommended treatment regimen and the level of rebates, chargebacks, discounts and other adjustments to our orkambi gross product revenues. we believe that there currently are approximately 8,500 patients in the united states who are eligible for treatment with orkambi and that as of december 31, 2015 more than 4,500 patients in the united states had started treatment with orkambi. following the approval in the european union in november 2015, we have begun the country-by-country reimbursement approval process. we believe that there are approximately 12,000 patients with cf twelve years of age and older who are homozygous for the f508del mutation in europe.
we recently completed the first of two phase 3 clinical trials evaluating orkambi for the treatment of patients with cf six to eleven years of age who are homozygous for the f508del mutation in their cftr gene. we believe that there are approximately 6,000 patients in the united states and european union within this patient population.
kalydeco kalydeco (ivacaftor) was approved in 2012 in the united states and european union as a treatment for patients with cf six years of age and older who have the g551d mutation in their cftr gene. since 2012, we have increased the number of patients who are being treated with kalydeco in the united states and non-u.s. markets by expanding the label for kalydeco to include patients with cf who have additional mutations in their cftr gene and to include patients in additional age demographics. we believe that there are approximately 4,000 patients in north america, europe and australia who are currently eligible for treatment with kalydeco.
cf development programs we have multiple development programs in the field of cf, including:
•   vx-661, a corrector compound that we are evaluating in a phase 3 development program in combination with ivacaftor in multiple cf patient populations who have at least one copy of the f508del mutation in their cftr gene;
•   vx-371, an investigational epithelial sodium channel, or enac, inhibitor, that is being evaluated in a phase 2 development program and which we exclusively licensed from parion sciences, inc. in 2015; and research and development we are engaged in a number of other research and mid- and early-stage development programs, including in the areas of oncology, pain and neurology.
oncology we are conducting two phase 1/2 clinical trials of vx-970, a protein kinase inhibitor of ataxia telangiectasia and rad3-related, or atr, in combination with commonly used dna-damaging chemotherapies across a range of solid tumor types, including triple negative breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. we also are in phase 1 development of vx-803, a second atr inhibitor, alone and in combination with chemotherapy. we recently initiated phase 1 clinical development of vx-984, a third oncology drug candidate, alone and in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin.
pain we are developing vx-150 and vx-241, two drug candidates for the treatment of pain. in the fourth quarter of 2015, we initiated a phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate vx-150 in patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee. we expect to begin clinical development of vx-241 in the first half of 2016.
acute spinal cord injury we are developing vx-210, a drug candidate for the treatment of acute spinal cord injury, that we exclusively licensed from bioaxone biosciences, inc. vx-210 is designed to inhibit a protein known as rho that blocks neural regeneration after injury. we expect to initiate a phase 2b/3 clinical trial in the first half of 2016 to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vx-210 in patients with certain acute cervical spinal cord injuries.
research we plan to continue investing in our research programs and fostering scientific innovation in order to identify and develop transformative medicines. we believe that pursuing research in diverse areas allows us to balance the risks inherent in drug development and may provide drug candidates that will form our pipeline in future years.
drug discovery and development discovery and development of a new pharmaceutical product is a difficult and lengthy process that requires significant financial resources along with extensive technical and regulatory expertise and can take 10 to 15 years or more. potential drug candidates are subjected to rigorous evaluations, driven in part by stringent regulatory considerations, designed to generate information concerning efficacy, side-effects, proper dosage levels and a variety of other physical and chemical characteristics that are important in determining whether a drug candidate should be approved for marketing as a pharmaceutical product. most chemical compounds that are investigated as potential drug candidates never progress into development, and most drug candidates that do advance into development never receive marketing approval. because our investments in drug candidates are subject to considerable risks, we closely monitor the results of our discovery, research, clinical trials and nonclinical studies and frequently evaluate our drug development programs in light of new data and scientific, business and commercial insights, with the objective of balancing risk and potential. this process can result in abrupt changes in focus and priorities as new information becomes available and as we gain additional understanding of our ongoing programs and potential new programs, as well as those of our competitors.
if we believe that data from a completed registration program support approval of a drug candidate, we submit an nda to the fda requesting approval to market the drug candidate in the united states and seek analogous approvals from comparable regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions. to obtain approval, we must, among other things, demonstrate with evidence gathered in nonclinical studies and well-controlled clinical trials that the drug candidate is safe and effective for the disease it is intended to treat and that the manufacturing facilities, processes and controls for the manufacture of the drug candidate are adequate. the fda and foreign regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in deciding whether or not a drug candidate should be granted approval based on the benefits and risks of the drug candidate in the treatment of a particular disease, and could delay, limit or deny regulatory approval. if regulatory delays are significant or regulatory approval is limited or denied altogether, our financial results and the commercial prospects for the drug candidate involved will be harmed.
regulatory compliance our marketing of pharmaceutical products is subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations. we have a corporate compliance program designed to actively identify, prevent and mitigate risk through the implementation of compliance policies and systems, and through the promotion of a culture of compliance. among other laws, regulations and standards, we are subject to various u.s. federal and state laws, and comparable foreign laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims statutes, and laws prohibiting the promotion of drugs for unapproved or off-label uses. anti-kickback laws make it illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration to induce the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. false claims laws prohibit anyone from presenting for payment to third-party payors, including medicare and medicaid, claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to maintain, administer and expand these compliance programs globally.
reimbursement sales of our products depend, to a large degree, on the extent to which our products are covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed health care organizations. we dedicate substantial management and other resources in order to obtain and maintain appropriate levels of reimbursement for our products from third-party payors, including governmental organizations in the united states and ex-u.s. markets. following the fda's july 2015 approval of orkambi in the united states, we are engaging in discussions with numerous commercial insurers and managed health care organizations, along with government health programs that are typically managed by authorities in the individual states. following the european commission's november 2015 approval of orkambi in europe, we are working to obtain government reimbursement for orkambi on a country-by-country basis, because in many foreign countries patients are unable to access prescription pharmaceutical products that are not reimbursed by their governments. consistent with our experience with kalydeco when it was first approved, we expect reimbursement discussions in ex-u.s. markets may take a significant period of time.
operating costs and expenses                                            1,499,215             1,272,827               1,821,983       226,388                    18   %          (549,156      )           (30   )%

net loss attributable to vertex was $556.3 million in 2015 as compared to a net loss attributable to vertex of $738.6 million in 2014. our revenues increased significantly in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to orkambi net product revenues, which commenced in the third quarter of 2015, and a $167.9 million increase in kalydeco net product revenues, partially offset by a $43.6 million decrease in our collaborative revenues. our operating costs and expenses increased in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to increases in research and development expenses, sales, general and administrative expenses and cost of product revenues, partially offset by decreased restructuring expenses and royalty expenses.
net loss attributable to vertex was $738.6 million in 2014 as compared to a net loss attributable to vertex of $445.0 million in 2013. our revenues decreased in 2014 as compared to 2013 due to a $442.3 million decrease in incivek net product revenues, a $166.1 million decrease in collaborative revenues and a $115.7 million decrease in royalty revenues, partially offset by a $92.5 million increase in kalydeco net product revenues. our operating costs and expenses decreased in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to an intangible asset impairment charge related to vx-222 of $412.9 million recorded in 2013 and decreases in cost of product revenues, royalty expenses, research and development expenses and sales, general and administrative expenses. in 2014, the $45.2 million loss reflected in other items, net was primarily due to interest expense associated with the leases for our corporate headquarters. in 2013 the $106.4 million gain reflected in other items, net was primarily due to a benefit from income taxes we recorded related to the vx-222 impairment charge. the income (loss) from discontinued operations in 2014 and 2013 related to a collaboration with alios that was terminated in 2014.
common shares outstanding our shares of outstanding common stock increased from 241.8 million shares on december 31, 2014 to 246.3 million shares on december 31, 2015 due to our issuance in 2015 of approximately 4.5 million shares of common stock pursuant to our employee equity programs. our shares of outstanding common stock increased from 233.8 million shares on december 31, 2013 to 241.8 million shares on december 31, 2014 due to our issuance in 2014 of approximately 8.0 million shares of common stock issued pursuant to our employee equity programs.
stock-based compensation stock-based compensation expense was $231.0 million, $177.5 million and $126.8 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. our stock-based compensation expense has been increasing due to the increase in our stock price and the associated increase in the grant-date fair value of equity awards.
in 2015, kalydeco net product revenues were $631.7 million, including $266.1 million of net product revenues from ex-u.s. markets, compared to kalydeco net product revenues of $463.8 million in 2014, including $201.4 million of net product revenues from ex-u.s. markets. in 2013, kalydeco net product revenues were $371.3 million, including $154.7 million of net product revenues from ex-u.s. markets. the increases were primarily due to additional patients being treated with kalydeco as we completed reimbursement discussions in various jurisdictions and increased the number of patients eligible to receive kalydeco through label expansions. we expect kalydeco net product revenues to increase in 2016 as compared to 2015.
orkambi net product revenues increased from $130.8 million in the third quarter of 2015 to $219.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. as of december 31, 2015, more than 4,500 patients, out of the approximately 8,500 eligible patients, had begun treatment with orkambi in the united states. we expect orkambi net product revenues to increase in 2016 as compared to 2015 as we recognize revenues over a full fiscal year. we believe that our orkambi revenues in 2016, will be dependent on:
•the total number of eligible patients in the united states who begin treatment with orkambi;
•the rate at which additional patients initiate treatment in 2016;
•the proportion of initiated patients who remain on treatment; and
•the compliance rate for patients who remain on treatment.
initially, we expect that our ex-u.s. orkambi net product revenues will be primarily from germany due to the time it will take to complete the reimbursement discussions in other european countries following orkambi's european approval in the fourth quarter of 2015.
incivek net product revenues were $18.0 million, $24.1 million and $466.4 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013. we have withdrawn incivek from the market. we may continue to recognize insignificant incivek revenues in 2016 as we adjust our incivek reserves for rebates, chargebacks and discounts.
royalty revenues our royalty revenues were $24.0 million, $40.9 million and $156.6 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. since the beginning of 2014, our royalty revenues have consisted of (i) revenues related to a cash payment we received in 2008 when we sold our rights to certain hiv royalties and (ii) revenues related to certain third-party royalties payable by our collaborators on sales of hiv drugs and telaprevir that also result in corresponding royalty expenses. in 2013, we received significant royalties from janssen nv based on incivo (telaprevir) net product sales. our rights to receive royalties on incivo sales ended at the beginning of 2014, and janssen nv currently has a fully-paid license to market incivo in its territories, subject to the continued payment of certain third-party royalties.
(1) 2015 includes $2.9 million of revenues related to variable interest entities consolidated for accounting purposes.
our collaborative revenues have fluctuated significantly on an annual basis and may continue to fluctuate in the future. in 2015, we did not have significant collaborative revenues. in 2014, the majority of our collaborative revenues related to $35.0 million in payments we received from janssen inc. related to our outlicense of vx-787. in 2013, we recognized $203.4 million in janssen nv collaborative revenues, which were primarily attributable to a $152.0 million payment we received pursuant to our amendment to the janssen nv collaboration agreement. these collaborative revenues also included the acceleration of the remaining deferred revenues related to the up-front payment we received from janssen nv in 2006.

cost of product revenues our cost of product revenues includes the cost of producing inventories that corresponded to product revenues for the reporting period, plus the third-party royalties payable on our net sales of our products. pursuant to our agreement with cystic fibrosis foundation therapeutics incorporated, or cfft, our tiered third-party royalties on sales of kalydeco and orkambi, calculated as a percentage of net sales, range from the single digits to the sub-teens.
our cost of product revenues increased in 2015 as compared to 2014 due primarily to increased net product revenues. our cost of product revenues decreased in 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to decreased net product revenues and the charges incurred in 2013 for excess and obsolete incivek inventories. we expect our cost of product revenues to increase in 2016 as compared to 2015 due to increased net product revenues.
royalty expenses royalty expenses include third-party royalties payable upon net sales of telaprevir by our collaborators in their territories and expenses related to a subroyalty payable to a third party on net sales of an hiv protease inhibitor sold by glaxosmithkline. royalty expenses do not include royalties we pay to cfft on sales of kalydeco and orkambi, which instead are included in cost of product revenues. royalty expenses in 2015 decreased by $13.9 million, or 65%, as compared to 2014, primarily as a result of decreased incivo (telaprevir) sales by our collaborator janssen nv. our royalty expenses with respect to telaprevir and the hiv protease inhibitor are offset by corresponding royalty revenues.

our research and development expenses include internal and external costs incurred for research and development of our drugs and drug candidates. we do not assign our internal costs, such as salary and benefits, stock-based compensation expense, laboratory supplies and other direct expenses and infrastructure costs, to individual drugs or drug candidates, because the employees within our research and development groups typically are deployed across multiple research and development programs. these internal costs are significantly greater than our external costs, such as the costs of services provided to us by clinical research organizations and other outsourced research, which we allocate by individual program. all research and development costs for our drugs and drug candidates are expensed as incurred.
over the past three years, we have incurred $2.7 billion in research and development expenses associated with drug discovery and development. the successful development of our drug candidates is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risks. in addition, the duration of clinical trials may vary substantially according to the type, complexity and novelty of the drug candidate and the disease indication being targeted. the fda and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial requirements on the introduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products, typically requiring lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures, sampling activities and other costly and time-consuming procedures. data obtained from nonclinical and clinical activities at any step in the testing process may be adverse and lead to discontinuation or redirection of development activities. data obtained from these activities also are susceptible of varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. the duration and cost of discovery, nonclinical studies and clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project and are difficult to predict. therefore, accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate costs to bring our drug candidates to market are not available.
in 2013, 2014 and 2015, costs related to our cf programs represented the largest portion of our development costs. any estimates regarding development and regulatory timelines for our drug candidates are highly subjective and subject to change. in 2015, we obtained approval for orkambi in the united states and europe, and began generating revenues from orkambi in the united states in the second half of 2015. we cannot make a meaningful estimate when, if ever, our other clinical development programs will generate revenues and cash flows.

over the past three years we have maintained a substantial investment in research activities resulting in increases in research expenses. our research expenses in 2015 included a one-time $75.0 million upfront payment we made to crispr therapeutics ag, or crispr, in connection with entry into our collaboration in the fourth quarter of 2015. excluding the upfront payment we made to crispr, our research expenses increased by 2% in 2015 as compared to 2014. we expect to continue to invest in our research programs with a focus on identifying drug candidates with the goal of creating transformative medicines.

our development expenses increased by $60.1 million, or 10%, in 2015 as compared to 2014 and decreased by $50.4 million, or 8%, in 2014 as compared to 2013. the increase in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to an increase in outsourced services related to ongoing clinical trials, including our phase 3 development program for vx-661 in combination with ivacaftor and an increase in stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by decreased infrastructure costs and decreased laboratory supplies and other direct expenses. we expect our development expenses to increase in 2016 as compared to 2015 due to activities related to clinical trials, including the phase 3 clinical development program for vx-661 in combination with ivacaftor.
the decreased development expenses in 2014 as compared to 2013 were principally due to decreased outsourced services expenses and drug supply costs, partially offset by increased stock-based compensation expense. the significant decrease in outsourced services expenses in 2014 was largely attributable to decreased clinical trial expenses resulting from the completion of the traffic and transport clinical trials in the first half of 2014.
sales, general and administrative expenses increased by 23% in 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily due to increased investment in commercial support for orkambi and kalydeco and costs incurred to prepare for the launch of orkambi in ex-u.s. markets. sales, general and administrative expenses decreased by 14% in 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily due to decreased headcount following our october 2013 restructuring activities. we expect sales, general and administrative expenses to increase in 2016 as compared to 2015 due to the continued expansion of our commercial infrastructure to support sales of orkambi.
restructuring expense in 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded restructuring expenses of $2.2 million, $50.9 million and $40.5 million, respectively. our restructuring expenses in 2014 primarily related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters in massachusetts to boston from cambridge. our restructuring expenses in 2013 primarily related to our october 2013 reduction in headcount. as of december 31, 2015, our accrued restructuring liability related to our lease obligation in cambridge was $13.9 million. this lease obligation expires on april 30, 2018.
intangible asset impairment charges in 2013, we recorded a $412.9 million impairment charge related to vx-222, a non-nucleoside hcv polymerase inhibitor. in connection with this impairment charge, we recorded a credit of $127.6 million in our provision for income taxes, resulting in a net effect on net loss attributable to vertex related to this impairment charge of $285.3 million in 2013. there were no corresponding intangible asset impairment charges recorded related to continuing operations in 2014 or 2015.
in 2013, we also recorded a $250.6 million impairment charge related to the alios hcv nucleotide analogue program and a benefit for income taxes of $102.1 million that is included in loss from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interest for 2013.
other items, net interest expense, net in 2015, 2014 and 2013, interest expense, net was $84.2 million, $72.9 million and $22.9 million, respectively. the increase in interest expense, net in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to the interest expense we incurred for the full fiscal year in 2015 on the $300.0 million that we borrowed in mid-2014 pursuant to our credit agreement. the increase in interest expense in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to interest expense of $60.2 million associated with the leases for our corporate headquarters in boston, massachusetts and interest expense of $10.4 million related to the $300.0 million we borrowed in mid-2014.
other (expense) income, net in 2015, net other expense was $6.7 million primarily due to foreign exchange losses. in 2014, we recorded net other income of $30.4 million primarily due to a credit of $36.7 million related to a one-time cash payment we received in 2014 from our landlord pursuant to leases for our corporate headquarters in boston, massachusetts. in 2013, we recorded net other income of $6.9 million primarily related to foreign exchange gains.
income taxes in 2015, we recorded a provision for income taxes of $30.4 million, principally due to the consolidation of parion as a vie into our consolidated financial statements in the second quarter of 2015. in 2014, we recorded a provision for income taxes of $7.0 million, of which approximately $3.9 million was due to the consolidation of bioaxone as a vie into our consolidated financial statements in the fourth quarter of 2014. in 2013, our benefit from income taxes was $122.4 million.
this benefit from income taxes was primarily due to a benefit of $127.6 million related to our impairment charge for the vx-222 intangible asset.
discontinued operations in 2014, we recorded a loss from discontinued operations attributable to vertex of $0.9 million.  in 2013, we recorded income from discontinued operations of $58.6 million. our income (losses) from discontinued operations in these periods related to gains and losses due to the deconsolidation of alios, an intangible asset impairment charge, a benefit from income taxes related to this charge and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration we estimated alios would receive under the collaboration agreement. for additional information regarding the alios collaboration please refer to "critical accounting policies and estimates - collaborations; variable interest entities."
liquidity and capital resources as of december 31, 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $1.04 billion, which represented an increase of $26.0 million from $1.02 billion as of june 30, 2015 and a decrease of $344.6 million from approximately $1.39 billion as of december 31, 2014.
in the second half of 2015, we maintained our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance due to increased cash receipts from product sales together with $97.7 million in cash we received from issuances of common stock pursuant to our employee benefit plans, offset by cash expenditures in the second half of 2015 related to, among other things, research and development expenses, sales, general and administrative expenses and an aggregate of $105.0 million in payments, including an equity investment, in connection with entry into our collaboration agreement with crispr in the fourth quarter of 2015.
the decrease in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities from december 31, 2014 to december 31, 2015 was due to cash expenditures we made during 2015 related to, among other things, research and development expenses and sales, general and administrative expenses, an $80.0 million payment to parion in connection with entering into our collaboration agreement with parion and an aggregate of $105.0 million in payments to crispr, including an equity investment, in connection with entry into our collaboration agreement with crispr, partially offset by cash receipts from product sales and $185.6 million in cash we received from issuances of common stock pursuant to our employee benefit plans. we also incurred $41.6 million in costs for capital expenditures including net cash flows from capital lease financing during 2015.
sources of liquidity we intend to rely on our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities together with cash flows from product sales as our primary source of liquidity. we are receiving cash flows from sales of orkambi in the united states and from sales of kalydeco in both in the united states and ex-u.s. markets. we expect to begin receiving cash flows from sales of orkambi in europe beginning in the first half of 2016. initially, we expect these cash flows will be primarily from germany due to the time it will take to complete the reimbursement discussions in other european countries.
we borrowed $300.0 million under a credit agreement that we entered into in july 2014 and, subject to certain conditions, we may request up to an additional $200.0 million pursuant to that credit agreement. in recent periods, we also have received significant proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee benefit plans, but the amount and timing of future proceeds from employee benefits plans is uncertain. other possible sources of liquidity include strategic collaborative agreements that include research and/or development funding, commercial debt, public and private offerings of our equity and debt securities, development milestones and royalties on sales of products, software and equipment leases, strategic sales of assets or businesses and financial transactions. negative covenants in our credit agreement may prohibit or limit our ability to access these sources of liquidity.
future capital requirements we incur substantial operating expenses to conduct research and development activities and to operate our organization. under the terms of our credit agreement, we are required to repay the principal amount on the $300.0 million we borrowed in july 2014 in installments of $75 million on each of october 1, 2016, january 1, 2017, april 1, 2017 and july 9, 2017. we also have substantial facility and capital lease obligations, including leases for two buildings in boston, massachusetts that continue through 2028. in addition, we have entered into certain collaboration agreements with third parties that include the funding of certain research, development and commercialization efforts with the potential for future milestone and royalty payments by us upon the achievement of pre-established developmental and regulatory targets.
we expect that cash flows from orkambi and kalydeco, together with our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. the adequacy of our available funds to meet our future operating and capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the amount of future revenues generated by orkambi and kalydeco and the potential introduction of one or more of our other drug candidates to the market, the level of our business development activities and the number, breadth, cost and prospects of our research and development programs.
financing strategy in july 2014, we borrowed $300.0 million pursuant to a credit agreement. in addition, subject to certain conditions, we may request that the lenders loan us up to an additional $200.0 million under the credit agreement. we may raise additional capital through public offerings or private placements of our securities or securing new collaborative agreements or other methods of financing. we will continue to manage our capital structure and will consider all financing opportunities, whenever they may occur, that could strengthen our long-term liquidity profile. negative covenants in our credit agreement may prohibit our ability to obtain future financing and there can be no assurance that any such financing opportunities will be available on acceptable terms, if at all.
contractual commitments and obligations the following table sets forth our commitments and obligations as of december 31, 2015:

leases we lease two buildings that are located at fan pier in boston, massachusetts. we commenced lease payments on these two buildings in december 2013 and the initial lease periods end in december 2028.
on december 2, 2015, we entered into a lease agreement, pursuant to which we agreed to lease approximately 170,000 square feet of office and laboratory space in a building to be built in san diego, california. the lease will commence upon completion of the building, scheduled for the second half of 2017 and will extend for 16 years from the commencement date. the future minimum rental payments that we are obligated to pay after taking occupancy are included in "facility leases, excluding fan pier leases."
our future minimum commitments under our kendall square lease are included in "facility leases, excluding fan pier leases." we have entered into three subleases for a portion of the rentable square footage at the kendall square facility to offset our on-going contractual lease obligations. the future minimum committed income from the subleases is $15.5 million for 2016 and $20.7 million total for 2017 and 2018. these amounts are not offset against our obligations set forth in the table above.
the table also reflects leases of equipment, leasehold improvements and software licenses that are accounted for as capital leases.
senior secured term loan in july 2014, we entered into a credit agreement that provides for a $300.0 million senior secured term loan. the term loan currently bears interest at 6.2% per annum and will bear interest at a rate of libor plus 5.0% per annum during the third year of the term. we are required to repay principal on the term loan in quarterly installments of $75 million from october 1, 2016 through the maturity date. we include estimates for interest in "senior secured term loan," which are equivalent to management's expectations for the probable outcome of variable interest rates that are dependent on various future events and market interest rates.
research, development and drug supply costs
"research, development and drug supply costs," does not include certain payments we are obligated to make to clinical research organizations, or cros, because these contracts are cancelable, at our option, with notice. however, we historically have not cancelled such contracts. as of december 31, 2015, we had accrued $30.6 million related to these contracts for costs incurred for services provided through december 31, 2015, and we have approximately $197.1 million in cancelable future commitments based on existing contracts as of december 31, 2015. these amounts reflect planned expenditures based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to, or terminations of, existing contracts or anticipated or potential new contracts.
collaborative arrangements we have entered into certain research and development collaboration agreements with third parties that include the funding of certain development, manufacturing and commercialization efforts with the potential for future milestone and royalty payments by us upon the achievement of pre-established developmental, regulatory and/or commercial targets. our obligation to fund these efforts is contingent upon continued involvement in the programs and/or the lack of any adverse events that could cause the discontinuance of the programs. pursuant to our collaboration with bioaxone, bioaxone has the potential to receive up to $90.0 million, including a license continuation fee and development and regulatory milestone payments; and commercial milestone payments as well as royalties on future product sales, if any. pursuant to our collaboration with parion, parion has the potential to receive milestone and royalty payments, including up to $490.0 million in development and regulatory milestone payments for the development of vx-371 (formerly p-1037) and/or vx-551 (formerly p-1055) to treat cf. pursuant to our collaboration with crispr, crispr has the potential to receive milestone and royalty payments, including up to $420.0 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments for each of up to six targets pursuant to the collaboration. we also have royalty obligations and a remaining $13.9 million milestone payment to the cfft that we expect to pay in 2016. contingent payments under these agreements become due and payable only upon achievement of certain milestones and are not included in the contractual obligations table above.
tax-related obligations we exclude liabilities pertaining to uncertain tax positions from our summary of contractual obligations as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. as of december 31, 2015, we did not have any liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions. as of december 31, 2015, we cannot reasonably estimate the amount we expect to pay within the next twelve months in connection with such settlements.
other funding commitments our table detailing contractual commitments and obligations does not include severance payment obligations to certain of our executive officers in the event of a not-for-cause employment termination under existing employment contracts. we provide information regarding these obligations annually in our proxy statement for our annual meeting of shareholders.
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. these items are monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future.
changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which the change occurs. we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate.
we believe that our application of the following accounting policies, each of which requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management, are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results:
•   revenue recognition;
•   intangible assets;
•   collaborations and variable interest entities;
•   research and development accruals;
•   restructuring expenses; and our accounting policies, including the ones discussed below, are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, including note a, "nature of business and accounting policies," included in this annual report on form 10-k.
revenue recognition product revenues, net we generate product revenues from sales in the united states and in international markets. we sell our products principally to a limited number of specialty pharmacy providers and selected regional wholesalers in north america as well as government-owned and supported customers in international markets, collectively, our customers. our customers in north america subsequently resell our products to patients and health care providers. we contract with government agencies and various private organizations so that our products will be eligible for purchase by, or partial or full reimbursement from, such third-party payors. we recognize net product revenues from sales of our products upon delivery to our customers as long as:
•   there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists between us and our customer;
•   collectability is reasonably assured; and in order to conclude that the price is fixed or determinable, we must be able to calculate our gross product revenues from our customers and reasonably estimate our net product revenues. our gross product revenues are based on the fixed price for our products that we charge our customers. we estimate our net product revenues by deducting from our gross product revenues (i) trade allowances, such as invoice discounts for prompt payment and customer fees, (ii) estimated government and private payor rebates, chargebacks and discounts, (iii) estimated reserves for expected product returns and (iv) estimated costs of incentives offered to certain indirect customers, including patients. we make significant estimates and judgments that materially affect our recognition of net product revenues. changes in our estimates of net product revenues could have a material effect on net product revenues recorded in the period in which we determine that change occurs.
in certain instances, we may be unable to reasonably conclude that the price is fixed or determinable at the time of delivery, in which case we defer the recognition of revenues. once we are able to determine that the price is fixed or determinable, we recognize the revenues associated with the units in which revenue recognition was deferred.
the value of the rebates, chargebacks and discounts provided to third-party payors per course of treatment vary significantly and are based on government-mandated discounts and our arrangements with other third-party payors. in order to estimate our total rebates, chargebacks and discounts, we estimate the percentage of prescriptions that will be covered by each third-party payor, which is referred to as the payor mix. we track available information regarding changes, if any, to the payor mix for our products, to our contractual terms with third-party payors and to applicable governmental programs and regulations and levels of our products in the distribution channel. we adjust our estimated rebates, chargebacks and discounts based on new information, including information regarding actual rebates, chargebacks and discounts for our products, as it becomes available. claims by third-party payors for rebates, chargebacks and discounts frequently are submitted to us significantly after the related sales, potentially resulting in adjustments in the period in which the new information becomes known.
we have withdrawn incivek from the market in the united states. at december 31,2015 the company maintains an accrual of less than $1 million for government rebates for incivek. there typically is no deadline by which government payors must submit claims, and as a result we are continuing to monitor this reserve. adjustments to this reserve are reflected as either an increase or decrease to net product revenues in the period in which the adjustment is made.
our customers generally have the right to return unopened unprescribed packages subject to contractual limitations. to date returns have been minimal and, based on inventory levels held by our customers and our distribution model, we believe that returns of products will continue to be minimal. we track actual returns by individual production lots and will continue to monitor inventory levels in the distribution channel. if necessary, we will adjust our estimated product returns based on new information as it becomes available.
collaborative revenues we recognize revenues generated through collaborative research, development and/or commercialization agreements. the terms of these agreements typically include payment to us of one or more of the following: nonrefundable, up-front license fees; development and commercial milestone payments; funding of research and/or development activities; payments for services we provide through our third-party manufacturing network; and royalties on net sales of licensed products. each of these types of payments results in collaborative revenues, except for revenues from royalties on net sales of licensed products, which are classified as royalty revenues.
for each collaborative research, development and/or commercialization agreement that results in revenues, we determine (i) whether multiple deliverables exist, (ii) whether the undelivered elements have value to the customer on a stand-alone basis, (iii) how the deliverables should be separated and (iv) how the consideration should be allocated to the deliverables. for arrangements entered into or materially modified after january 1, 2011, we allocate consideration in an arrangement using the relative selling price method based on our best estimate of selling price of deliverables if we do not have vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence. as part of the accounting for these agreements, we must develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the best estimate of selling price. we utilize key assumptions to determine the best estimate of selling price, which may include patient enrollment requirements from regulatory authorities, development timelines, reimbursement rates for personnel costs, discount rates, and estimated third-party development costs.
in the fourth quarter of 2013, we amended our collaboration agreement with janssen nv, and were required to make significant estimates regarding (i) the determination of whether or not the agreement was materially modified and (ii) the estimated selling price for the remaining telaprevir development activities. we recognized $182.4 million of collaborative revenues pursuant to the collaboration agreement in the fourth quarter of 2013. this amount was primarily attributable to (i) the new consideration received from janssen nv, including the $152.0 million fourth quarter 2013 payment and the remaining deferred revenues related to the 2006 up-front payment less (ii) our best estimate of selling price for the remaining telaprevir development activities. as of december 31, 2015, the remaining deferred revenue balance related to janssen nv was not material.
intangible assets we maintain an indefinite-lived in-process research and development asset on our consolidated balance sheet until either the research and development project underlying it is completed or the asset becomes impaired. when we determine that an asset has become impaired or we abandon a project, we write down the carrying value of the related intangible asset to its fair value and take an impairment charge in the period in which the impairment occurs.
we assess the fair value of assets, including intangible assets such as in-process research and development assets, using a variety of methods, including present-value models that are based upon multiple probability-weighted scenarios involving the development and potential commercialization of the acquired drug candidates. the present-value models require us to make significant assumptions regarding the estimates that market participants would make in evaluating a drug candidate, including the probability of successfully completing clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approval to market the drug candidate, the timing of and the expected costs to complete in-process research and development projects, future net cash flows from potential drug sales, which are based on estimates of the sales price of the drug, the number of patients who will be diagnosed and treated and our competitive position in the marketplace, and appropriate discount and tax rates.
we test our intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis as of october 1, and more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstance suggest that impairment may exist. events that could result in an impairment, or trigger an interim impairment assessment, include the receipt of additional clinical or nonclinical data regarding our drug candidate or a potentially competitive drug candidate, changes in the clinical development program for a drug candidate or new information regarding potential sales for the drug. in connection with each annual impairment assessment and any interim impairment assessment, we compare the fair value of the asset as of the date of the assessment with the carrying value of the asset on our consolidated balance sheet.
in 2013, we incurred intangible asset impairment charges of $412.9 million and $250.6 million related to continuing operations and discontinued operations, respectively, that related to drug candidates for the treatment of hcv infection. as of december 31, 2015, we had $284.3 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet related to our vies.
collaborations; variable interest entities our collaborations require us to apply accounting policies that involve significant judgments and that have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. under applicable accounting guidance, as a result of the relationships established through collaboration agreements, our collaborators may be deemed to be variable interest entities, or vies, our licenses may result in a variable interest in collaborators as a whole and our being the primary beneficiary of vies. as a result, we are required to consolidate vies financial statements into our financial statements for the period during which we have a variable interest in the vie and are the vie's primary beneficiary, and if we later determine that we no longer have a variable interest or are no longer the primary beneficiary, we are required to deconsolidate the vie. if we determine that we no longer have significant continuing involvement with a vie, its operations and direct expenses incurred by us are reflected in our discontinued operations presentation.
in addition, each period our net loss (income) is adjusted for gains and losses in the fair value of the contingent milestone payments and royalties payable by us to our vies. determining the fair value of the contingent milestone payments and royalties payable by us to vies requires us to make significant estimates regarding the probability and potential timing of achieving each of the milestones pursuant to the agreement, future potential net sales and appropriate discount and tax rates.
we believe that the following effects of the consolidation and deconsolidation of vies on our consolidated financial statements are the most significant:
•   beginning in the second quarter of 2015, we are consolidating all of parion's expenses and revenues into our consolidated statements of operations, eliminating all intercompany balances and transactions. as of december 31, 2015, our consolidated balance sheet includes parion's balances.
•   beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014, we are consolidating all of bioaxone's expenses and revenues into our consolidated statements of operations, eliminating all intercompany balances and transactions. as of december 31, 2015, our consolidated balance sheet includes bioaxone's balances.
•   as of september 30, 2014, we concluded that we no longer had significant continuing involvement with alios due to our intent and ability to terminate the alios agreement, which we terminated during the fourth quarter of 2014; therefore, the operations of alios, including collaboration expenses reimbursed by vertex are presented as discontinued operations for the periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
•   in 2013, the deconsolidation of alios resulted in a gain of $68.2 million attributable to vertex. the $68.2 million gain was approximately equal to the difference between (i) losses we recorded in 2011 and 2012 based on increases in the fair value of contingent milestone payments and royalties payable by us to alios and (ii) the aggregate of $120.0 million in up-front and milestone payments that we made to alios pursuant to the alios collaboration.
•   in 2013, we recorded net loss (income) attributable to the alios noncontrolling interest. this net loss (income) attributable to the alios noncontrolling interest is included in loss from discontinued operations for 2013.
research and development accruals research and development expenses, including amounts funded through research and development collaborations, are expensed as incurred. when third-party service providers' billing terms do not coincide with our period-end, we are required to make estimates of our obligations to those third parties, including clinical trial and pharmaceutical development costs, contractual services costs, costs for drug supply, marketing expenses and infrastructure expenses incurred in a given accounting period and record accruals at the end of the period. we base our estimates on our knowledge of the research and development programs, services performed for the period, experience with related activities and the expected duration of the third-party service contract, where applicable.
commercial supplies and inventories we began capitalizing the costs of our kalydeco inventories on january 1, 2012 and the costs of our orkambi inventories on july 1, 2014. we capitalize inventories produced in preparation for initiating sales of a drug candidate when the related drug candidate is considered to have a high likelihood of regulatory approval and the related costs are expected to be recoverable through sale of the inventories. in determining whether or not to capitalize such inventories, we evaluate, among other factors, information regarding the drug candidate's safety and efficacy, the status of regulatory submissions and communications with regulatory authorities and the outlook for commercial sales, including the existence of current or anticipated competitive drugs and the availability of reimbursement. in addition, we evaluate risks associated with manufacturing the drug candidate and the remaining shelf life of the inventories. after we begin capitalizing inventories, we perform an assessment of the recoverability of capitalized inventory during each reporting period, and write down any excess and obsolete inventories to their net realizable value in the period in which the impairment is first identified.
in 2013, following periodic assessments of the recoverability of our inventories, we recorded within cost of product revenues an aggregate of $10.4 million in charges primarily related to excess and obsolete incivek inventories based on our analysis of our inventory levels in relation to our commercial outlook for incivek. as of december 31, 2015, all of our inventories are related to kalydeco and orkambi. periodic assessments of the recoverability of capitalized costs involve significant estimates and judgments on the part of management.
income taxes we maintain a valuation allowance on the majority of our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets because we have an extended history of annual losses. our u.s. federal net operating loss carryforwards totaled approximately $4.2 billion as of december 31, 2015. on an annual basis, we reassess the valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets. after consideration of all the evidence, both positive and negative, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset as of december 31, 2015 because it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. in future periods, if we determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized, (i) the valuation allowance would be decreased, (ii) a portion or all of the deferred tax asset would be reflected on our consolidated balance sheet and (iii) we would record non-cash benefits in our consolidated statements of operations related to the reflection of the deferred tax asset on our consolidated balance sheet.
leases in 2011, we entered into two leases for our corporate headquarters. our corporate headquarters were built during the period from 2011 through december 2013. we lease our corporate headquarters pursuant to leases that expire in 2028, subject to our right to extend the leases for an additional 10 years. because we were involved in the construction project, we were deemed for accounting purposes to be the owner of the buildings during the construction period. accordingly, we recorded project construction costs incurred by the landlord as an asset and a related financing obligation in "property and equipment, net" and "construction financing lease obligation," respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets.
upon completion of the construction of the buildings, we evaluated the leases and determined that the leases did not meet the criteria for "sale-leaseback" treatment. accordingly, we depreciate the asset and incur interest expense related to the financing obligation recorded on our balance sheet. we bifurcate our lease payments pursuant to the leases into (i) a portion that is allocated to the buildings and (ii) a portion that is allocated to the land on which the buildings were constructed. the portion of the lease obligations allocated to the land is treated as an operating lease. in connection with the leases for our corporate headquarters, we incurred $60.2 million in interest expense, $13.3 million in depreciation expense and $6.5 million in operating expense in 2015. in 2016, we expect interest expense, depreciation expense and operating expenses related to the leases for our corporate headquarters to be approximately consistent with that from 2015.
restructuring expenses we have adopted several plans to restructure our facility operations for which we have incurred restructuring expenses in the three years ended december 31, 2015. in particular, in 2014, we recorded $50.9 million in costs associated with exit and disposal activities related to the relocation of our headquarters in massachusetts from cambridge to boston and maintained a liability related to these activities of $6.0 million as of december 31, 2015. our initial estimate of our liabilities for net ongoing costs associated with these facility obligations are recorded at fair value. in estimating the expenses and liabilities related to these facilities, we utilize probability-weighted discounted cash-flows of our ongoing lease obligations. in estimating the expense and liability under our lease obligations, we estimate (i) the costs to be incurred to satisfy rental and build-out commitments under the lease (including operating costs), (ii) the lead-time necessary to sublease the space, (iii) the projected sublease rental rates and (iv) the anticipated durations of subleases. we use a credit-adjusted risk-free rate to discount the estimated cash flows.
we review our estimates and assumptions on at least a quarterly basis. we intend to continue such reviews until the termination of these facility lease obligations and will make whatever modifications we believe are necessary, based on our best judgment, to reflect any changed circumstances. our estimates have changed in the past, and may change in the future, resulting in additional adjustments to the estimate of these liabilities. changes to our estimate of these liabilities are recorded as additional restructuring expenses (credits). in addition, because our estimate of these liabilities includes the application of a discount rate to reflect the time-value of money, we record imputed interest costs related to these liabilities each quarter. these costs are included in restructuring expenses on our consolidated statements of operations.
stock-based compensation expense stock-based compensation expense is determined based on the fair value of the equity award at the grant date, net of estimated forfeitures, and is adjusted each period to reflect actual forfeitures and the outcomes of certain performance conditions. for awards with performance conditions that accelerate vesting of the award, we estimate the likelihood of satisfaction of the performance conditions, which affects the period over which the expense is recognized, and recognize the expense using the accelerated attribution model. for awards with performance conditions in which the award does not vest unless the performance condition is met, we recognize expense only if we estimate that achievement of the performance condition is probable. if we conclude that vesting is probable, we recognize expense from the date that we reach this conclusion through the estimated vesting date. since 2014, we have provided to employees who have rendered a certain number of years of service and meet certain age requirements, partial or full acceleration of vesting of their equity awards, subject to certain conditions including a notification period, upon a termination of employment other than for cause. if actual forfeitures differ significantly from our estimates, if our estimates regarding the employees who will be eligible for partial or full acceleration of their equity awards, if the likelihood of achievement of a performance conditions changes or if any of our other assumptions or estimates prove incorrect, our stock-based compensation expense, or the period over which our stock-based compensation is recognized, could be materially affected.
recent accounting pronouncements refer to note a, "nature of business and accounting policies," in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. there were no new accounting pronouncements adopted during 2015 that had a material effect on our financial statements.

item 1a.   risk factors this report and other documents we file with the sec contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management's assumptions. these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties facing our business. the risks described below are not the only ones facing us. our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price.
our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval.
our business is subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal governmental authorities in the united states, including the fda, and by foreign regulatory authorities, including the ema. we are required in the united states and in foreign countries to obtain approval from regulatory authorities before we can manufacture, market and sell our products. once approved, the fda and other u.s. and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial authority to require additional testing, perform inspections, change product labeling or mandate withdrawals of our products. failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative and/or judicially imposed sanctions. the sanctions could include the fda's or foreign regulatory authorities' refusal to approve pending applications, delays in obtaining or withdrawals of approvals, delay or suspension of clinical trials, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of our operations, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecution.
obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval has been and will continue to be increasingly difficult, time-consuming and costly. there may be situations in which demonstrating the efficacy and safety of a product candidate may not be sufficient to gain regulatory approval unless superiority to comparative products can be shown. also, legislative bodies or regulatory agencies could enact new laws or regulations or change existing laws or regulations at any time, which could affect our ability to obtain or maintain approval of our products or product candidates. for example, the eu recently finalized legislation, which will apply as early as mid-2016, related to the conduct of clinical trials. while the aim of the new legislation is improvement in operational efficiency and a streamlining of the overall clinical trial authorization process, the new requirements also provide for increased transparency of clinical trial results and submission of quality data relating to the products and product candidates used for such trials. starting in 2015, the ema will make certain clinical trial reports publicly available, which may limit our ability to protect competitively-sensitive information contained in our clinical trial reports. failure to comply with new laws or regulations could result in significant monetary penalties as well as reputational and other harms. we are unable to predict when and whether any further changes to laws or regulatory policies affecting our business could occur, such as efforts to reform medical device regulation or the pedigree requirements for medical products or to implement new requirements for combination products, and whether such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
regulatory authorities may also question the sufficiency for approval of the endpoints we select for our clinical trials. for example, questions remain about regulatory authorities' views regarding the adequacy for approval of therapeutic oncology products that have demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in endpoints such as pfs or durable response rate (drr) but have not shown a statistically significant improvement in overall survival. a number of our products and product candidates have been evaluated in clinical trials using endpoints other than overall survival, such as pfs, drr, and bone-metastasis-free survival (bmfs). the use of endpoints such as pfs, drr, or bmfs, in the absence of other measures of clinical benefit, may not be sufficient for approval even when such results are statistically significant. regulatory authorities could also add new requirements, such as the completion of an outcomes study or a meaningful portion of an outcomes study, as conditions for obtaining approval or obtaining an indication. the imposition of additional requirements may delay our clinical development and regulatory filing efforts, and delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval for new product candidates, new indications for existing products or maintenance of our current labels.
some of our products are approved by u.s. and foreign regulatory authorities on a conditional basis with full approval conditioned upon fulfilling the requirements of regulators. for example, in july 2012 our subsidiary onyx pharmaceuticals received accelerated approval for kyprolis® in the united states, with full approval conditioned on us conducting additional clinical trials of the use of kyprolis® as a therapy in treating multiple myeloma. regulatory authorities are placing greater focus on monitoring products originally approved on an accelerated or conditional basis and on whether the sponsors of such products have met the conditions of the accelerated or conditional approvals. if we are unable to fulfill the requirements of regulators that were conditions of our products' accelerated or conditional approval and/or if regulators re-evaluate the data or risk-benefit profile of our product in connection with a renewal assessment, our conditional approval may be revoked or not renewed or we may not receive full approval for these products or may be required to change the products' labeled indications or even withdraw the products from the market.
safety problems or signals can arise as our products and product candidates are evaluated in clinical trials, including investigator sponsored studies, or as our marketed products are used in clinical practice. we are required to continuously collect and assess adverse events reported to us and to communicate to regulatory agencies these adverse events and safety signals regarding our products. regulatory agencies periodically perform inspections of our pharmacovigilance processes, including our adverse event reporting. in 2012, pharmacovigilance legislation became effective in the eu that enhanced the authority of european regulators to require companies to conduct additional post-approval clinical efficacy and safety studies and increased the requirement on sponsor companies to analyze and evaluate the risk-benefit profiles of their products. if regulatory agencies determine that we or other parties (including our clinical trial investigators or licensees of our products) have not complied with the applicable reporting or other pharmacovigilance requirements, we may become subject to additional inspections, warning letters or other enforcement actions, including monetary fines, marketing authorization withdrawal and other penalties. our product candidates and marketed products can also be affected by safety problems or signals occurring with respect to products that are similar to ours and that implicate an entire class of products. further, as a result of clinical trials, including sub-analyses or meta-analyses of earlier clinical trials (a meta-analysis involves the use of various statistical methods to combine results from previous separate but related studies) performed by us or others, concerns may arise about the sufficiency of the data or studies underlying a product's approved label. such actual or perceived safety problems or concerns can lead to:
•revised or restrictive labeling for our products;
•   requirement of risk management activities or other regulatory agency compliance actions related to the promotion and sale of our products;
•mandated post-marketing commitments or pharmacovigilance programs for our approved products;
•   revocation of approval for our products from the market completely, or within particular therapeutic areas or patient types;
•increased timelines or delays in being approved by the fda or other regulatory bodies; and/or
•fewer treatments or product candidates being approved by regulatory bodies.
for example, beginning in 2006, adverse safety results involving esas were observed and since that time our esas have been the subject of ongoing review and scrutiny. reviews by regulatory authorities of the risk-benefit profile of esas has resulted in changes to esa labeling and usage in both the oncology and nephrology clinical settings.
in addition to our innovative products, we are working to develop and commercialize biosimilar versions of nine products currently manufactured, marketed and sold by other pharmaceutical companies. (see item 1. business-research and development and selected product candidates-amgen development of biosimilars.) in many markets there is not yet a legislative or regulatory pathway for the approval of biosimilars. in the united states, the aca provided for such a pathway; while the fda is working to implement it, significant questions remain as to how products will be approved under the pathway. (see we expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars.) delays or uncertainties in the development of such pathways could result in delays or difficulties in getting our products approved by regulatory authorities, subject us to unanticipated development costs or otherwise reduce the value of the investments we have made in the biosimilars area. additionally, biosimilar products may be subject to patent dispute resolution and/or patent infringement litigation, which could delay or prevent the commercial launch of a product.
some of our products are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic devices which have their own regulatory, manufacturing and other risks.
some of our products or product candidates may be used in combination with a drug delivery device, such as an injector or other delivery system. our product candidates or expanded indications of our products used with such drug delivery devices may not be approved or may be substantially delayed in receiving regulatory approval if such devices do not gain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance. where approval of the product and device is sought under a single marketing drug application, the increased complexity of the review process may also delay receipt of regulatory approval. in addition, some of these drug delivery devices may be provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party companies. we are dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of those third-party companies both to supply the devices and, in some cases, to conduct the studies required for approval or clearance by the applicable regulatory agencies. we are also dependent on those third-party companies continuing to meet the applicable regulatory and other requirements to maintain that approval or clearance once it has been received. failure to successfully develop or supply the devices, delays in or failure of the amgen or third-party studies, or failure of amgen or the third-party company to obtain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance of the devices could result in increased development costs, delays in or failure to obtain regulatory approval and/or associated delays in a product candidate reaching the market or the expansion of existing product labels for new indications. loss of regulatory approval or clearance of a device that is used with our product may also result in the removal of our product from the market. further, failure to successfully develop, supply, or gain or maintain approval for these devices could adversely affect sales of the related, approved products.
similarly, some of our products or product candidates may be used in combination with an in vitro companion diagnostic device, such as a test kit. in some cases, our product candidates or expanded indications of our products used with in vitro companion diagnostic devices may not be approved or may be substantially delayed in receiving regulatory approval if such devices do not gain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance. as with drug delivery devices used with our products, our ability to get and maintain the necessary regulatory approvals for our products or product candidates used with in vitro companion diagnostic devices can be substantially dependent on whether the manufacturers of such devices meet their contractual responsibilities to us and/or their obligations to regulatory authorities. failures by these manufacturers can also result in the significant delays and added costs described above, or even result in the removal of our product from the market.
amgen invests heavily in r&d. successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain, and very few r&d projects produce a commercial product. product candidates (including biosimilar product candidates) or new indications for existing products (collectively, "product candidates") that appear promising in the early phases of development may fail to reach the market for a number of reasons, such as:
•   the product candidate did not demonstrate acceptable clinical trial results even though it demonstrated positive preclinical trial results, for reasons that could include changes in the standard of care of medicine;
•   the product candidate was not effective or more effective than currently available therapies in treating a specified condition or illness;
•the product candidate had harmful side effects in humans or animals;
•the necessary regulatory bodies, such as the fda or ema, did not approve our product candidate for an intended use;
•the product candidate was not economical for us to manufacture and commercialize;
•   the biosimilar product candidate fails to demonstrate the requisite biosimilarity to the applicable reference product, or is otherwise determined to be unacceptable for purposes of safety or efficacy, to gain approval;
•   other parties have or may have proprietary rights relating to our product candidate, such as patent rights, and will not let us sell it on reasonable terms, or at all;
•   we and certain of our licensees, partners or independent investigators may fail to effectively conduct clinical development or clinical manufacturing activities; and
•the regulatory pathway to approval for product candidates is uncertain or not well-defined.
several of our product candidates have failed or been discontinued at various stages in the product development process. inability to bring a product to market or a significant delay in the expected approval and related launch date of a new product for any of the reasons discussed could potentially have a negative impact on our net sales and earnings and could result in a significant impairment of in-process research and development (ipr&d) or other intangible assets.
we must conduct clinical trials in humans before we can commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications.
before we can sell any products, we must conduct clinical trials to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans. the results of those clinical trials are used as the basis to obtain approval from regulatory authorities such as the fda and ema. (see our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval.) we are required to conduct clinical trials using an appropriate number of trial sites and patients to support the product label claims. the length of time, number of trial sites and patients required for clinical trials vary substantially and therefore, we may spend several years and incur substantial expense in completing certain clinical trials. we may have difficulty finding a sufficient number of clinical trial sites and subjects to participate in our clinical trials, particularly if competitors are conducting clinical trials in similar patient populations. delays in planned clinical trials can result in increased development costs, delays in regulatory approvals, associated delays in product candidates reaching the market and revisions to existing product labels.
in addition, in order to increase the number of patients available for enrollment for our clinical trials, we have and will continue to open clinical sites and enroll patients in a number of new geographic locations where our experience conducting clinical trials is more limited, including russia, india, china, south korea, the philippines, singapore and some central and south american countries, either through utilization of third-party contract clinical trial providers entirely or in combination with local staff. conducting clinical trials in locations where we have limited experience requires substantial time and resources to identify and understand the unique regulatory environments of individual countries. further, we must ensure the timely production, distribution and delivery of the clinical supply of our product candidates to the numerous and varied clinical trial sites. if we fail to adequately manage the design, execution and diverse regulatory aspects of our large and complex clinical trials or manage the production or distribution of our clinical supply, corresponding regulatory approvals may be delayed or we may fail to gain approval for our product candidates or could lose our ability to market existing products in certain therapeutic areas or altogether. if we are unable to market and sell our product candidates or to obtain approvals in the timeframe needed to execute our product strategies, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
we rely on independent third-party clinical investigators to recruit subjects and conduct clinical trials on our behalf in accordance with the applicable study protocols and laws and regulations. further, we rely on unaffiliated third-party vendors to perform certain aspects of our clinical trial operations. we also may acquire companies that have ongoing clinical trials. these trials may not be conducted to the same standards as ours; however, once an acquisition has been completed we assume responsibility for the conduct of the trial, including any potential risks and liabilities associated with the past and prospective conduct of those trials. if regulatory authorities determine that we or others, including our licensees or the independent investigators selected by us or by a company we have acquired, have not complied with regulations applicable to the clinical trials, those authorities may refuse or reject some or all of the clinical trial data or take other actions which could impair our ability to obtain or maintain marketing approval of the product or indication. if we were unable to market and sell our products or product candidates, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
in addition, some of our clinical trials involve drugs manufactured and marketed by other pharmaceutical companies. these drugs may be administered in a clinical trial in combination with one of our products or product candidates or in a head-to-head study comparing the products' or product candidates' relative efficacy and safety. in the event that any of these vendors or pharmaceutical companies have unforeseen issues that negatively impact the quality of their work or creates a shortage of supply, our ability to complete our applicable clinical trials and/or evaluate clinical results may also be negatively impacted. as a result, this could adversely affect our ability to timely file for, gain or maintain regulatory approvals worldwide.
•require additional or longer trials to gain approval;
•prohibit regulatory approval of our product candidates or new indications for existing products; and
•   render the product candidate commercially unfeasible or limit our ability to market existing products completely or in certain therapeutic areas.
clinical trials must be designed based on the current standard of medical care. however in certain diseases, such as cancer, the standard of care is evolving rapidly. in these diseases, the duration of time needed to complete certain clinical trials may result in the design of such clinical trials being based on standards of medical care that are no longer the current standards when such trials are completed, limiting the utility and application of such trials. we may not obtain favorable clinical trial results and therefore may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for new product candidates, new indications for existing products or maintenance of our current product labels.
even after a product is on the market, safety concerns may require additional or more extensive clinical trials as part of a risk management plan for our product or for approval of a new indication. for example, in connection with the june 2011 esa label changes, we also agreed to conduct additional clinical trials examining the use of esas in ckd. additional clinical trials we initiate, including those required by the fda, could result in substantial additional expense and the outcomes could result in additional label restrictions or the loss of regulatory approval for an approved indication, each of which could have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. additionally, any negative results from such trials could materially affect the extent of approvals, the use, reimbursement and sales of our products.
we expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars.
we currently face competition in europe from biosimilars, and we expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars in the future. to the extent that governments adopt more permissive approval frameworks and competitors are able to obtain broader marketing approval for biosimilars, our products will become subject to increased competition. expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights could trigger such competition, and we could face more litigation regarding the validity and/or scope of our patents. our products may also experience greater competition from lower-cost biosimilars that come to market as branded products that compete with our products lose patent protection.
in the eu, the ec has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued since 2005. in addition, in an effort to spur biosimilar utilization and/or increase potential healthcare savings, some european countries, such as france, have considered and may adopt biosimilar uptake measures such as requiring physician prescribing quotas or automatic substitution by pharmacists of biosimilars for the corresponding reference products. some eu countries may impose automatic price reductions upon market entry of the second or third biosimilar competitor. we cannot predict to what extent the entry of biosimilars or other competing products will impact future sales of our products in the eu. our inability to compete effectively could reduce sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
in the united states, the aca authorized the fda to approve biosimilars via a separate, abbreviated pathway. (see item 1. business-government regulation-regulation in the united states-approval of biosimilars.) a growing number of companies have announced their intentions to develop biosimilar versions of existing biotechnology products, including a number of our products as well as the biosimilars we are working to develop. four manufacturers have announced the filing of five separate marketing applications to the fda under the biosimilar pathway. these marketing applications include two for filgrastim, one for pegfilgrastim, and one for epoetin alfa, which if approved would compete with our neupogen®, neulasta® and epogen® products, respectively. initial fda approvals for the first u.s. biosimilars may occur as early as 2015. further, other biosimilar manufacturers with approved products in europe may seek to obtain u.s. approval now that the regulatory pathway for biosimilars has been enacted. the u.s. pathway includes the option for biosimilar products meeting certain criteria to be approved as interchangeable with their reference products. some companies currently developing biosimilars may seek to register their products as interchangeable biologics, which could make it easier for prescribers or pharmacists to substitute those biosimilars for our products. in addition, critics of the 12-year exclusivity period in the biosimilar pathway law will likely seek to shorten the data exclusivity period and/or to encourage the fda to interpret narrowly the law's provisions regarding which new products receive data exclusivity. while we are unable to predict the precise impact of the pending introduction of biosimilars on our products, we expect in the future to face greater competition in the united states as a result of biosimilars and downward pressure on our product prices and sales, subject to our ability to enforce our patents. this additional competition could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
our products face substantial competition.
we operate in a highly competitive environment. (see item 1. business-competition.) in the future, we expect that our products will compete with new drugs currently in development, drugs currently approved for other indications that may later be approved for the same indications as those of our products and drugs approved for other indications that are used off-label. large pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers of pharmaceutical products are expanding into the biotechnology field, and some pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers have formed partnerships to pursue biosimilars. in addition, some of our competitors may have technical, competitive or other advantages over us for the development of technologies and processes or greater experience in particular therapeutic areas. these advantages may make it difficult for us to compete with them to successfully discover, develop and market new products and for our current products to compete with new products or new product indications that these competitors may bring to market. as a result, our products may compete against products that have lower prices, equivalent or superior performance, better safety profile, are easier to administer or that are otherwise competitive with our products. our products may also experience greater competition from lower-cost biosimilars or generics that come to market as branded products that compete with our products lose their own patent protection. in november 2013, teva launched short-acting granix® in the u.s. to compete with neupogen® and long-acting lipegfilgrastim in europe to compete with neulasta®. in addition, epogen® and aranesp® face competition from the launch of mircera® in the united states. in october 2014, pursuant to a december 2009 settlement agreement between amgen and roche, roche began selling mircera® in the united states under the terms of a limited-license agreement. in addition, our product candidates may face competition from competing products that achieve earlier entry into the market. for example, several of our competitors are working to develop pcsk9 inhibitors at the same time we are developing repathatm, our own pcsk9 inhibitor. if a competitor gains marketing approval for its pcsk9 inhibitor and launches its product prior to repathatm receiving marketing approval, the competing product may have an advantage due to its earlier entry into the market.
sales of our principal products are dependent on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including government healthcare programs and private insurance plans. governments and private insurers have pursued, and continue to pursue, aggressive cost containment and utilization management initiatives, including increased focus on comparing the effectiveness, benefits and costs of similar treatments, which could result in lower reimbursement rates for our products or narrower populations for whom our products will be reimbursed by payers.
a substantial portion of our u.s. business relies on reimbursement from u.s. federal government healthcare programs. further, as the federal agency responsible for administering medicare, medicaid and the new health insurance marketplaces (or "exchanges"), cms has substantial power to quickly implement policy changes that can significantly affect how our products are covered and reimbursed. additionally, there is an increased focus in the united states on analyzing the impact of various government programs on the federal deficit, which has resulted in increased pressure on federal programs to reduce costs and could lead to lower payment rates for our products. additionally, the implementation of aca's exchanges could drive consolidation in the insurance industry. the resulting consolidated entities could have greater leverage in making coverage and reimbursement decisions and exert additional pressure on our ability to price and secure patient access for our products. further, the current exchange offerings tend to have very high deductibles and cost-sharing requirements for drugs. access to our products may be affected by the structure and amount of patient out-of-pocket payments in both plans that operate in exchanges and also commercial plans. changes to those out-of-pocket payments, or limitations to payment assistance options, could have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. private payers, including healthcare insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, also continue to seek to reduce their costs. healthcare insurers, pharmacy benefit managers and other payers may seek price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies or those they manage. they could also impose restrictions on access to our products or future products, and could even choose to exclude coverage entirely. such discounts, rebates, restrictions or exclusions could materially and adversely affect sales of our affected products.
outside the united states, we expect that countries will continue to take aggressive actions to reduce their healthcare expenditures. (see item 1. business-reimbursement.) any deterioration in the coverage and reimbursement available for our products or in the timeliness or certainty of payment by payers to physicians and other providers could negatively impact the ability or willingness of healthcare providers to prescribe our products for their patients or otherwise negatively affect the use of our products or the prices we receive for them. such changes could have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operations.
we also face risks relating to the reporting of pricing data that affects the u.s. reimbursement of and discounts for our products. pricing data that we submit impacts the payment rates for providers, rebates we pay, and discounts we are required to provide under medicare, medicaid and other government drug programs, and the calculations are complex. price reporting regulations require a manufacturer to update certain previously submitted data. our price reporting data calculations are reviewed on a quarterly basis, and based on such reviews we have on occasion restated previously reported pricing data to reflect changes in calculation methodology, reasonable assumptions, and/or underlying data. if our submitted pricing data are incorrect, we may become subject to substantial fines and penalties or other government enforcement actions, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. in addition, if our pricing calculations are incorrect, we also may be required to pay additional rebates and provide additional discounts.
we rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components.
we rely on unaffiliated third-party suppliers for certain raw materials, medical devices and components necessary for the manufacturing of our commercial and clinical products. certain of those raw materials, medical devices and components are the proprietary products of those unaffiliated third-party suppliers and are specifically cited in our drug application with regulatory agencies so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source or sources and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the regulatory agency approved such supplier. also, certain of the raw materials required in the commercial and clinical manufacturing of our products are sourced from other countries and/or derived from biological sources, including mammalian tissues, bovine serum and human serum albumin.
•regulatory requirements or action by regulatory agencies or others;
•adverse financial or other strategic developments at or affecting the supplier;
•unexpected demand for or shortage of raw materials, medical devices or components;
•   failure to comply with our quality standards which results in quality and product failures, product contamination and/or recall;
these events could negatively impact our ability to satisfy demand for our products, which could materially and adversely affect our product use and sales and our business and operating results. for example, in prior years we have experienced shortages in certain components necessary for the formulation, fill and finish of certain of our products in our puerto rico facility. further quality issues which result in unexpected additional demand for certain components may lead to shortages of required raw materials or components (such as we have experienced with epogen® glass vials). we may experience or continue to experience these or other shortages in the future resulting in delayed shipments, supply constraints, contract disputes and/or stock-outs of our products. we continue to investigate alternatives to certain biological sources and alternative manufacturing processes that do not require the use of certain biologically derived substances because such raw materials may be subject to contamination and/or recall. however, any disruptions or delays by us or by third-party suppliers or partners in converting to alternatives to certain biologically derived substances and alternative manufacturing processes or our ability to gain regulatory approval for the alternative materials and manufacturing processes could increase our associated costs or result in the recognition of an impairment in the carrying value of certain related assets, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.
manufacturing biologic human therapeutic products is difficult, complex and highly regulated. we currently are involved in the manufacture of all of our principal products and plan to manufacture many of our product candidates. in addition, we currently use third-party contract manufacturers to produce or assist in the production of enbrel, prolia®, sensipar®/mimpara®, nplate®, xgeva®, vectibix® and kyprolis® and plan to use contract manufacturers to produce or assist in the production of a number of our late-stage product candidates. our ability to adequately and timely manufacture and supply our products and product candidates is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our facilities and those of our third-party contract manufacturers, which may be impacted by:
•capacity of our facilities and those of our contract manufacturers;
•contamination by microorganisms or viruses, or foreign particles from the manufacturing process;
•degree of compliance with regulatory requirements;
•changes in forecasts of future demand;
•updating of manufacturing specifications;
•contractual disputes with our suppliers and contract manufacturers; and
•timing and outcome of product quality testing.
if the efficient manufacture and supply of our products or product candidates is interrupted, we may experience delayed shipments, delays in our clinical trials, supply constraints, stock-outs and/or recalls of our products. over the past several years we have initiated a number of voluntary recalls of certain lots of our products. for example, beginning in september 2010, we initiated a voluntary recall of certain lots of epogen® and j&j voluntarily recalled certain lots of procrit®, manufactured by us, because a small number of vials in each lot were found to contain glass lamellae (extremely thin, barely visible glass flakes) which we believed was a result of the interaction of the product formulation with glass vials during the shelf life of the product. the recalls were executed in close cooperation with the fda. as an additional example, in july 2014, we initiated a voluntary recall of an aranesp® lot distributed in the eu after particles were detected in a quality control sample following distribution of that lot. we may experience the same or other problems in the future, resulting in broader product recalls, adverse event trends, delayed shipments, supply constraints, contract disputes and/or stock-outs of our products. if we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of our products to patients, we may lose patients and physicians may elect to prescribe competing therapeutics instead of our products, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, business and results of operations.
our manufacturing processes and those of our third-party contract manufacturers must undergo regulatory approval processes and are subject to continued review by the fda and other regulatory authorities. it can take longer than five years to build, validate and license a new manufacturing plant and it can take longer than three years to qualify and license a new contract manufacturer. currently, we are completing the construction and qualification of a new formulation and filling facility at our puerto rico site, and we are modifying and expanding our recently acquired formulation, fill and finish manufacturing site in ireland, both of which will require appropriate licensure by regulatory authorities. additionally, in 2014 we completed construction of the planned monoclonal antibody manufacturing facility in singapore. this singapore facility will utilize a novel manufacturing technology that has not been previously approved by the fda or other regulatory authorities. in 2014, we also announced plans to build an additional facility at the site in singapore to enable the manufacture of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for kyprolis®. these facilities in singapore will also require licensure by various regulatory authorities. if we are unable to obtain needed licenses for any of these facilities on a timely basis, it could adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned risk mitigation and cost reductions which, as a result, could materially and adversely affect our product sales, business and results of operations.
if regulatory authorities determine that we or our third-party contract manufacturers or certain of our third-party service providers have violated regulations or if they restrict, suspend or revoke our prior approvals, they could prohibit us from manufacturing our products or conducting clinical trials or selling our marketed products until we or the affected third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers comply, or indefinitely. because our third-party contract manufacturers and certain of our third-party service providers are subject to the fda and foreign regulatory authorities, alternative qualified third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers may not be available on a timely basis or at all. if we or our third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers cease or interrupt production or if our third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers fail to supply materials, products or services to us, we may experience delayed shipments, supply constraints, stock-outs and/or recalls of our products. additionally, we distribute a substantial volume of our commercial products through our primary distribution centers in louisville, kentucky for the united states and in breda, the netherlands for europe and much of the rest of the world. we also conduct all the labeling and packaging of our products distributed in europe and much of the rest of the world in breda, the netherlands. our ability to timely supply products is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operations of our distribution and logistics centers, our third-party logistics providers and our labeling and packaging facility in breda. further, we rely on commercial transportation for the distribution of our products to our customers which may be negatively impacted by natural disasters or security threats.
we perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at our puerto rico manufacturing facility and a substantial amount of our clinical manufacturing activities at our thousand oaks, california manufacturing facility; if significant natural disasters or production failures occur at the puerto rico facility, we may not be able to supply these products or, at the thousand oaks facility, we may not be able to continue our clinical trials.
we currently perform all of the formulation, fill and finish for neulasta®, neupogen®, aranesp®, epogen®, prolia® and xgeva® and substantially all of the formulation, fill and finish operations for enbrel at our manufacturing facility in juncos, puerto rico. we also currently perform all of the bulk manufacturing for neulasta®, neupogen® and aranesp®, all of the purification of bulk epogen® material and substantially all of the bulk manufacturing for prolia® and xgeva® at this facility. we perform substantially all of the bulk manufacturing and formulation, fill and finish, and packaging for product candidates to be used in clinical trials at our manufacturing facility in thousand oaks, california. the global supply of our products and product candidates is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of these facilities. a number of factors could materially and adversely affect our operations, including:
•power failures and/or other utility failures;
•breakdown, failure or substandard performance of equipment;
•inability or unwillingness of third-party suppliers to provide raw materials and components; and these or other problems may result in our being unable to supply our products, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, business and operating results. our puerto rico facility is also subject to the same difficulties, disruptions or delays in manufacturing experienced in our other manufacturing facilities. for example, the limited number of lots of epogen® voluntarily recalled in 2010 were manufactured at our puerto rico facility. in future inspections, our failure to adequately address the fda's expectations could lead to further inspections of the facility or regulatory actions. (see manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.)
our efforts to acquire other companies or products and to integrate their operations may not be successful, and may result in costs, delays or failures to realize the benefits of the transactions.
we have an ongoing process of evaluating potential merger, acquisition, partnering and in-license opportunities that we expect will contribute to our future growth and expand our geographic footprint, product offerings and/or our r&d pipeline. acquisitions may result in unanticipated costs, delays or other operational or financial problems related to integrating the acquired company and business with our company, which may result in the diversion of our management's attention from other business issues and opportunities. failures or difficulties in integrating or retaining new personnel or in integrating the operations of the businesses that we acquire (including their technology, compliance programs, financial systems, distribution and general business operations and procedures), while preserving important r&d, distribution, marketing, promotion and other relationships, may affect our ability to grow and may result in us incurring asset impairment or restructuring charges. for example, on october 1, 2013, we acquired onyx, a biopharmaceutical company with several currently marketed products as well as pipeline candidates progressing through the development process and failures or difficulties in the integration of onyx could result in a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
our intellectual property positions may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or expire, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation.
our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates. the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. third parties may challenge, invalidate or circumvent our patents and patent applications relating to our products, product candidates and technologies. in addition, our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not infringe our patents. for certain of our product candidates, there are third parties who have patents or pending patent applications that they may claim necessitate payment of a royalty or prevent us from commercializing these product candidates in certain territories. patent disputes are frequent, costly and can preclude, delay or increase the cost of commercialization of products. we have been in the past, and may be in the future, involved in patent litigation. a determination made by a court, agency or tribunal concerning infringement, validity, enforceability, injunctive or economic remedy, or the right to patent protection, for example, are typically subject to appellate or administrative review. upon review, such initial determinations may be afforded little or no deference by the reviewing tribunal and may be affirmed, reversed, or made the subject of reconsideration through further proceedings. a patent dispute or litigation may not discourage a potential violator from bringing the product that is alleged to infringe to market prior to a final resolution of the dispute or litigation. the period of time from inception until resolution of a patent dispute or litigation is subject to the availability and schedule of the court, agency or tribunal before which the dispute or litigation is pending. we may be subject to competition during this period and may not be able to fully recover for the losses, damages, and harms we incur from infringement by the competitor product even if we prevail. moreover, if we lose or settle current or future litigations at certain stages or entirely, we could be subject to competition and/or significant liabilities, be required to enter into third-party licenses for the infringed product or technology or be required to cease using the technology or product in dispute. in addition, we cannot guarantee that such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
further, under the hatch-waxman act, our products approved by the fda under the fdca may be the subject of patent litigation with generic competitors before expiry of the five year period of data exclusivity provided for under the hatch-waxman act and prior to the expiration of the patents listed for the product. likewise, our innovative biologic products may be the subject of patent litigation prior to the expiration of our patents and, with respect to competitors seeking approval as a biosimilar or interchangeable version of our products, prior to the twelve year exclusivity period provided under the aca. in addition, we may face additional patent litigation involving claims that the biosimilar product candidates we are working to develop infringe the patents of other companies that manufacture, market or sell the applicable reference products.
certain of the existing patents on our principal products have recently expired or will expire this year or over the next few years. (see item 1. business-marketing, distribution and selected marketed products-patents.) as our patents expire, competitors may be able to legally produce and market similar products or technologies, including biosimilars, which may have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. we have received, and we continue to seek, additional patent protection relating to our products, including patents on our products, specific processes for making our products, formulations and particular uses of our products. however, competitors may be able to invalidate, design around or otherwise circumvent our patents and sell competing products.
our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business in emerging markets.
we expect a significant portion of growth in our future business to come from expanding in emerging markets. as we continue our expansion efforts in emerging markets around the world, through acquisitions and licensing transactions as well as through the development and introduction of our current products into new markets, we face numerous risks to our business. there is no guarantee that the company's efforts and strategies to expand sales in emerging markets will succeed. emerging market countries may be especially vulnerable to periods of global political, legal, regulatory and financial instability, including sovereign debt issues, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and/or the imposition of international sanctions in response to certain state actions. the company may also be required to increase its reliance on third-party agents and unfamiliar operations and arrangements previously utilized by companies that we partner with or acquire in emerging markets (see we must conduct clinical trials in humans before we can commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications.). our international operations and business may also be subject to less protective intellectual property or other applicable laws, diverse data privacy and protection requirements, changing tax laws and tariffs, far-reaching anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations and an evolving legal and regulatory environment. these legal and operational challenges along with governmental controls, the challenges of attracting and retaining qualified personnel and obtaining and/or maintain necessary regulatory or pricing approvals of our products may result in a material adverse impact on the international sales of our products, our business and results of operations.
concentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and consolidation of free-standing dialysis clinic businesses may negatively impact our business.
the substantial majority of our u.s. product sales is made to three pharmaceutical product wholesaler distributors: amerisourcebergen corporation, cardinal health, inc. and mckesson corporation. these distributors, in turn, sell our products to their customers, which include physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. one of our products, epogen®, is sold primarily to free-standing dialysis clinics, which have experienced significant consolidation. two organizations, davita and fresenius medical care north america, own or manage a large number of the outpatient dialysis facilities located in the united states and account for a substantial majority of all epogen® sales in the free-standing dialysis clinic setting. due to this concentration, these entities have substantial purchasing leverage, which may put pressure on our pricing by their potential ability to extract price discounts on our products or fees for other services, correspondingly negatively impacting our bargaining position and profit margins.
our business may be affected by litigation and government investigations.
we and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings. (see part iv-note 18, contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements.) civil and criminal litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome can result in costly verdicts, fines and penalties, exclusion from the federal healthcare programs and/or injunctive relief that affect how we operate our business. defense of litigation claims can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting and it is possible that we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages or change the way we operate our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. in addition, product liability is a major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products. we may face substantial product liability exposure in human clinical trials and for products that we sell after regulatory approval. product liability claims, regardless of their merits, could be costly and divert management's attention and adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our products. amgen and immunex have previously been named as defendants in product liability actions for certain of our products.
we are also involved in government investigations that arise in the ordinary course of our business. as we announced on december 19, 2012, we finalized a settlement agreement with the u.s. government and various other parties to settle certain allegations regarding our sales and marketing practices. however, we may also be subject to actions by governmental entities, including those not participating in the settlement, and may in the future become subject to claims by other parties, in each case with respect to the alleged conduct which is the subject of the settlement. we may see new governmental investigations of or actions against us citing novel theories of recovery. any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability.
we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and other jurisdictions in which we do business. as a result, our provision for income taxes is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various places we operate. significant judgment is required for determining our provision for income tax and our tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. we believe our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open years based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes, the ultimate resolution of any tax matters may result in payments greater or less than amounts accrued. our provision for income taxes and results of operations in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of income and expenses in countries with differing tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in applicable tax laws, regulations or administrative interpretations thereof. for example, there are several proposals under consideration in the united states to reform tax law, including proposals that may reduce or eliminate the deferral of u.s. income tax on our unrepatriated foreign earnings. a significant change to the u.s. tax system, such as a change to the taxation of income earned outside the united states including credits allowed for foreign taxes, or a significant change to the puerto rico tax system, could have a material and adverse effect on our business and on the results of our operations.
we may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.
the capital and credit markets may experience extreme volatility and disruption which may lead to uncertainty and liquidity issues for both borrowers and investors. we may access the capital markets to supplement our existing funds and cash generated from operations in satisfying our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. in the event of adverse capital and credit market conditions, we may be unable to obtain capital market financing on similar favorable terms, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit rating agencies could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.
our risk mitigation measures and corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we effectively manage all operational risks and that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable u.s. federal and state regulations and all potentially applicable foreign regulations and/or other requirements.
the development, manufacturing, distribution, pricing, sales, marketing and reimbursement of our products, together with our general operations, are subject to extensive federal and state regulation in the united states and to extensive regulation in foreign countries. (see our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval and manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.) in addition, our business is complex, involves significant operational risks and includes the use of third parties to conduct business. while we have implemented numerous risk mitigation measures to comply with such regulations in this complex operating environment, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to effectively mitigate all operational risks. further, we are operating under a corporate integrity agreement with the u.s. department of health and human services, oig, which requires us to maintain our corporate compliance program and to undertake a set of defined obligations. the corporate integrity agreement requires us to make periodic attestations that we are implementing and following the provisions of the corporate integrity agreement, and provides for an independent third-party review organization to assess and report on our compliance to the oig. while we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program, we cannot guarantee that we, our employees, our partners, our consultants, our contractors or other third parties are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable u.s. federal and state regulations and/or laws, all potentially applicable foreign regulations and/or laws and/or all requirements of the corporate integrity agreement. if we fail to adequately mitigate our operational risks or if we or our agents fail to comply with any of those regulations, laws and/or requirements of the corporate integrity agreement, a range of actions could result, including, but not limited to, the termination of clinical trials, the failure to approve a product candidate, restrictions on our products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of our products from the market, significant fines, exclusion from government healthcare programs or other sanctions or litigation. such occurrences could have a material and adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.
we are increasingly dependent on information technology systems, infrastructure and data.
we are increasingly dependent upon information technology systems, infrastructure and data. the multitude and complexity of our computer systems make them inherently vulnerable to service interruption or destruction, malicious intrusion and random attack. likewise, data privacy or security breaches by employees or others may pose a risk that sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to the company, its patients, customers or other business partners, may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and have become increasingly difficult to detect. cyber-attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, denial-of-service, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten data confidentiality, integrity and availability. our key business partners face similar risks and any security breach of their systems could adversely affect our security posture. while in the past we have experienced cyber-attacks and intrusions into our computer systems, we do not believe that such attacks have had a material adverse effect on our operations. while we continue to invest heavily in the protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions, or identify breaches in our systems, that could adversely affect our business and operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive information, which could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm to us.
global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.
our operations and performance have been, and may continue to be, affected by economic conditions in the united states and throughout the world. as more fully explained below, financial pressures may cause government or other third-party payers to more aggressively seek cost containment through mandatory discounts on our products, policies requiring the automatic substitution of generics or biosimilars, higher hurdles for initial reimbursement approval for new products or other similar measures. (see we expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars.) for example, in recent years, amgen has had to pay increased discounts under the 340b drug pricing program in the united states through expansion to more settings of care and making more entities eligible to the mandatory discounts. additionally, as a result of global economic conditions, third-party payers may delay or be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations. in addition, as a result of the economic conditions and/or employer decisions regarding the insurance coverage mandate that goes into effect in the united states in 2015 and 2016, some employers may seek to reduce costs by reducing or eliminating employer group healthcare plans or transferring a greater portion of healthcare costs to their employees. job losses or other economic hardships may also result in reduced levels of coverage for some individuals, potentially resulting in lower levels of healthcare coverage for themselves or their families. these economic conditions may affect patients' ability to afford health care as a result of increased co-pay or deductible obligations, greater cost sensitivity to existing co-pay or deductible obligations, lost healthcare insurance coverage or for other reasons. we believe such conditions have led and could continue to lead to changes in patient behavior and spending patterns that negatively affect usage of certain of our products, including some patients delaying treatment, rationing prescription medications, leaving prescriptions unfilled, reducing the frequency of visits to healthcare facilities, utilizing alternative therapies and/or foregoing healthcare insurance coverage. in addition to its effects on consumers, any economic downturn may have also increased cost sensitivities among medical providers in the united states, such as oncology clinics, particularly in circumstances where providers may experience challenges in the collection of patient co-pays or be forced to absorb treatment costs as a result of coverage decisions or reimbursement terms. collectively, we believe these changes have resulted and may continue to result in reduced demand for our products, which could materially and adversely affect the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. any resulting decrease in demand for our products could also cause us to experience excess inventory write-offs and/or excess capacity or impairment charges at certain of our manufacturing facilities.
economic conditions continue to affect our operations and performance outside the united states as well, particularly in countries where government-sponsored healthcare systems are the primary payers for healthcare expenditures. credit and economic conditions have adversely impacted the timing of collections of our trade receivables. (see part ii-item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation-financial condition, liquidity and capital resources.) further economic challenges may impact our ability to collect some or all of our receivables, which could have a material adverse impact on our operating cash flows and a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity or results of operations. (see our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers.)
we also rely upon third parties for certain parts of our business, including licensees and partners, wholesale distributors of our products, contract clinical trial providers, contract manufacturers and single third-party suppliers. there may be a disruption or delay in the performance or satisfaction of commitments to us by these third parties which could have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. current economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our distributors, customers and suppliers to obtain the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials and to perform their obligations under agreements with us, which could disrupt our operations. further, economic conditions appear to have affected, and may continue to affect, the business practices of our wholesale distributors in a manner that contributes to lower sales of our products. although we monitor our distributors', customers' and suppliers' financial condition and their liquidity in order to mitigate our business risks, some of our distributors, customers and suppliers may become insolvent, which could have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products, our business and results of operations. these risks may be elevated with respect to our interactions with third parties with substantial operations in countries where current economic conditions are the most severe, particularly where such third parties are themselves exposed to sovereign risk from business interactions directly with fiscally-challenged government payers.
we maintain a significant portfolio of investments disclosed as cash equivalents and marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheet. the value of our investments may be adversely affected by interest rate fluctuations, downgrades in credit ratings, illiquidity in the capital markets and other factors that may result in other than temporary declines in the value of our investments. any of those events could cause us to record impairment charges with respect to our investment portfolio or to realize losses on the sale of investments.
our stock price, like that of our peers in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, is volatile. our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons. events such as a delay in product development or even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause financial results for a period to be below our expectations or projections. as a result, our revenues and operating results and, in turn, our stock price may be subject to significant fluctuations.
government agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products. however, professional societies, practice management groups, insurance carriers, physicians, private health/science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases from time to time may also publish guidelines or recommendations to healthcare providers, administrators and payers, and patient communities. recommendations by government agencies or those other groups/organizations may relate to such matters as usage, dosage, route of administration and use of related therapies as well as reimbursement of our products by government and private payers. in addition, hta organizations, such as the national institute for health and clinical excellence in the uk and the canadian agency for drugs and technologies in health, make reimbursement recommendations to payers in their jurisdictions based on the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and service impact of new, emerging and existing medicines and treatments. any recommendations or guidelines that result in decreased use, dosage or reimbursement of our products could materially and adversely affect our product sales, business and operating results. in addition, the perception by the investment community or stockholders that such recommendations or guidelines will result in decreased use and dosage of our products could adversely affect the market price for our common stock.
the commercialization of certain of our product candidates and the marketing of certain of our products is dependent in part on our partners.
we have entered into agreements with third parties to assist in the commercialization of certain of our product candidates and the marketing of certain of our products in specified geographic areas. (see item 1. business-business relationships.) many of these agreements involve the sharing of certain decisions and a division of responsibilities, costs and benefits. if our partners fail to effectively deliver on their marketing and commercialization commitments to us or if we and our partners fail to coordinate our efforts effectively, sales of our products may be materially and adversely affected.
our board of directors has declared quarterly dividends on our common stock since it adopted a dividend policy in 2011. in addition, in october 2014, our board of directors authorized an increase in our stock repurchase program that resulted in a total of $4.0 billion available under the repurchase program. whether we pay such dividends and repurchase our stock in the future, and the amount and timing of such dividends and/or stock repurchases are subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all respective laws and agreements of the company applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends and the repurchase of stock. future dividends and stock repurchases, including their timing and amount, may be affected by, among other factors: our views on potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions, including acquisitions; debt service requirements; our credit rating; changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws; and changes to our business model. in addition, the amount we spend and the number of shares we are able to repurchase under our stock repurchase program may further be affected by a number of other factors, including the stock price and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares. our dividend payments and/or stock repurchases may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends and/or repurchase stock in any particular amounts or at all. the reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments and/or stock repurchases could have a negative effect on our stock price.
the illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit versions of our products or of stolen or diverted products could have a negative impact on our reputation and business.
third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which do not meet the exacting standards of our company's development, manufacturing and distribution processes. counterfeit medicines pose a significant risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured and the lack of regulation of their contents.  counterfeit products are frequently unsafe or ineffective and can be potentially life-threatening. our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of counterfeit drugs sold under our brand name. in addition, products stolen from inventory, at warehouses, plants or while in transit or unlawfully diverted, which are not properly stored and which are sold through unauthorized channels, could adversely impact patient safety, our reputation and our business. public loss of confidence in the integrity of biologics and/or pharmaceutical products as a result of counterfeiting or theft could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.
we may experience difficulties, delays or unexpected costs and not achieve anticipated benefits and savings from our recently announced restructuring plan.
during the second half of 2014, we initiated a restructuring plan to invest in continuing innovation and the launch of our new pipeline molecules, while improving our cost structure. as part of the plan, we expect to reduce staff and close or dispose of certain facilities. we may not realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits and savings from our restructuring efforts due to unforeseen difficulties, delays or unexpected costs, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations.
following the completion of our restructuring, we must execute our core business initiatives, including advancing our pipeline and addressing competition from competitor products and biosimilars, with fewer human resources. we must also attract, retain and motivate key employees that are critical to our business. if we are unable to effectively execute with fewer staff members and/or attract, retain or motivate key employees, it may adversely affect our business.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management's discussion and analysis (md&a) is intended to assist the reader in understanding amgen's business. md&a is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. our results of operations discussed in md&a are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states (gaap). amgen operates in one business segment: human therapeutics. therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis.
forward-looking statements this report and other documents we file with the sec contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management's assumptions. in addition, we, or others on our behalf, may make forward-looking statements in press releases or written statements, or in our communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, webcasts, phone calls and conference calls. such words as "expect," "anticipate," "outlook," "could," "target," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe," "seek," "estimate," "should," "may," "assume," and "continue," as well as variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. these statements are not guarantees of future performance and they involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. we describe our respective risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could affect the outcome or results of operations in item 1a. risk factors. we have based our forward-looking statements on our management's beliefs and assumptions based on information available to our management at the time the statements are made. we caution you that actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed, implied or forecast by our forward-looking statements. reference is made in particular to forward-looking statements regarding product sales, regulatory activities, clinical trial results, reimbursement, expenses, earnings per share (eps), liquidity and capital resources, trends and planned dividends, stock repurchases and restructuring plans. except as required under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the sec, we do not have any intention or obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements after the distribution of this report, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise.
overview amgen is committed to unlocking the potential of biology for patients suffering from serious illnesses by discovering, developing, manufacturing and delivering innovative human therapeutics. this approach begins by using tools like advanced human genetics to unravel the complexities of disease and understand the fundamentals of human biology.
amgen focuses on areas of high unmet medical need and leverages its biologics manufacturing expertise to strive for solutions that improve health outcomes and dramatically improve people's lives. a biotechnology pioneer since 1980, amgen has grown to be one of the world's leading independent biotechnology companies, has reached millions of patients around the world and is developing a pipeline of medicines with breakaway potential.
our principal products include neulasta®, neupogen®, enbrel, xgeva®, prolia®, epogen®, aranesp® and sensipar®/mimpara®. for additional information about our products, see part i, item 1. business-marketing, distribution and selected marketed products.
our strategy for long-term growth continues to focus on discovery and development of innovative medicines to address serious illnesses, development of branded biosimilars, global expansion, next-generation manufacturing of high quality biologics, development of improved biologic drug delivery systems and return of capital to shareholders.
in 2014, we advanced our strategy. revenues increased 7% driven by strong performance across the portfolio. product sales grew 5% in the united states and 11% in the rest of the world (row). we continued returning capital to shareholders through the payment of dividends and through stock repurchases. we paid dividends of $0.61 per share of common stock in each of the four quarters of 2014, representing a 30% increase over the quarterly dividend paid in each of the four quarters of 2013. in december 2014, we declared a dividend of $0.79 per share of common stock, payable in march 2015, representing a 30% increase over the quarterly dividend paid in 2014. in october 2014, our board of directors approved an increase in our stock repurchase authorization that resulted in a total of $4.0 billion available under that program. we reinitiated repurchase activity in november 2014 and repurchased 0.9 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $153 million during the remainder of 2014.
in addition to delivering strong operating results, our innovative pipeline, which includes both internally-developed and externally-acquired opportunities, continued to advance in 2014, with the following milestones achieved:
clinical program           lead indication                       milestone repathatm                   dyslipidemia                          us submission eu submission corlanor®                  chronic heart failure                 us submission kyprolis®*                 multiple myeloma                      phase 3 aspire data talimogene laherparepvec   metastatic melanoma                   us submission eu submission blincytotm                  relapsed/refractory all               us approval eu submission brodalumab**               moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis   phase 3 data amg 416                    secondary hyperparathyroidism         phase 3 data amg 334                    migraine prophylaxis                  phase 2b data (episodic)
* marketed by onyx, an amgen subsidiary
** developed in collaboration with astrazeneca during 2014, six of our medicines generated positive registration-enabling data and four were submitted for regulatory approval. in december 2014, the fda approved blincytotm and the neulasta® delivery kit, including the on-body injector for neulasta®. in 2014, we also advanced and expanded our biosimilar program, including announcing plans to add three more biosimilar molecules to our portfolio-for a total of nine. finally, in january 2015, we and onyx announced the submission of a snda to the fda and an maa to the ema for kyprolis® to seek approval for the treatment of patients with relapsed multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy.
we believe that we are uniquely positioned for the opportunities arising in biology and to deliver our strategy. we have near- and long-term growth opportunities ahead, including: (i) the approval and launch of new indications for kyprolis® in the united states and europe as well as the approval and launch of several new innovative biologics, including repathatm and brodalumab, (ii) continuing to move into new geographic growth markets and (iii) the development, approval and launch of our biosimilars. we are present in more than 75 countries and, in 2014 we continued to expand into new geographic growth markets, including additional markets in latin america, the middle east and asia.
we announced a restructuring plan during the second half of 2014 that reduces our staff and our facilities footprint by the end of 2015. this restructuring plan allows us to invest in continuing innovation and the launch of our new pipeline molecules while improving our cost structure. we are also advancing a number of key initiatives to streamline processes, increase agility and efficiencies, and improve operating performance. these initiatives include improved contracting and sourcing, rationalizing discretionary spending, greater use of shared services and optimizing r&d efficiency. also during 2014, we completed facilities construction and entered the licensure process for a next-generation biomanufacturing facility in singapore which we believe, when licensed, will enable us to increase our manufacturing productivity versus conventional alternatives at lower capital costs and operating expense. our restructuring plan and our continued focus on increasing cost efficiencies in all areas of the company will enable us to reallocate resources to fund many of our growth opportunities to deliver value to patients and shareholders.
our business will continue to face various challenges. certain of our products will face increasing competitive pressure as a result of competitive product launches. additionally, certain of the existing patents on our principal products recently expired or will expire this year or over the next few years, and we expect to face increasing competition, including biosimilars. for additional information, including information on the expiration of patents for various products, see part i, item 1. business-marketing, distribution and selected marketed products-patents and see part i, item 1. business-marketing, distribution and selected marketed products-competition.
current global economic conditions also pose challenges to our business, including continued pressure to reduce healthcare expenditures. efforts to reduce healthcare costs are being made by third-party payers including governments and private payers. in the united states, various actions have been taken aimed at reducing healthcare spending. the continuing prominence of u.s. budget deficits increases the risk that taxes, fees, rebates, or other federal measures that would further reduce our revenues or increase our expenses may be enacted. as a result of economic conditions, the industry continues to experience significant pricing pressures and other cost containment measures in certain non-u.s. countries also.
our long-term success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover, develop and commercialize innovative products and acquire or collaborate on therapies currently in development by other companies. the discovery and development of safe and effective new products, as well as the development of additional indications for existing products, are necessary for the continued strength of our business. we must develop new products over time in order to offset revenue losses when products lose their exclusivity or competing products are launched, as well as in order to provide for revenue and earnings growth. we devote considerable resources to r&d activities. however, successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain. we are also confronted by increasing regulatory scrutiny of safety and efficacy both before and after products launch.
finally, our product sales can be affected by wholesaler and end-user buying patterns. these effects can cause fluctuations in quarterly product sales. for example, sales of certain of our products in the united states for the three months ended march 31 are usually lower relative to the preceding fourth quarter. these effects have generally not been significant when comparing full-year product performance to the prior year.
see part i, item 1. business-marketing, distribution and selected marketed products and part i, item 1a. risk factors for further discussion of certain of the factors that could impact our future product sales.
selected financial information the following is an overview of our results of operations (in millions, except percentages and per share data):

in the following discussion of changes in product sales, any reference to unit growth or decline refers to changes in the purchases of our products by healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies.
the increase in u.s. product sales for 2014 reflects growth across the portfolio except for neupogen®, which declined 28%. this overall growth was driven primarily by increases in average net sales prices and, to a lesser extent, unit growth, offset partially by a decline in wholesaler and, based on prescription data for enbrel and sensipar®, end-user inventory levels. also, 2014 included a full year of kyprolis® product sales as a result of the onyx acquisition on october 1, 2013. the increase in row product sales for 2014 reflects growth primarily in our marketed products except enbrel and aranesp®, which declined 4% and 2%, respectively. the row increase was driven by unit growth, offset partially by declines in average net sales prices.
the increase in other revenues for 2014 was due primarily to a full year of nexavar® collaboration revenues as a result of the onyx acquisition.
the increase in operating expenses for 2014 was driven primarily by cost of sales and restructuring charges, offset partially by the end of the enbrel profit share on october 31, 2013.
the increase in net income for 2014 was due primarily to higher operating income, offset partially by a higher effective income tax rate.
the increase in diluted eps for 2014 was driven primarily by an increase in net income offset partially by an increase in diluted shares.
although changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. our hedging activities seek to offset the impacts, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in euros. the net impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates was not material in 2014, 2013 or 2012.
2014                                                       change                              2013          change                              2012
future sales of our products will depend, in part, on the factors discussed in the overview, part 1-item 1. business-marketing, distribution and selected marketed products-competition, part 1-item 1a. risk factors and any additional factors discussed in the individual product sections below. in addition, for a list of our products' significant competitors, see part 1-item 1. business-marketing, distribution and selected marketed products-competition.

the increase in global neulasta® sales for 2014 was driven primarily by an increase in the average net sales price in the united states. the decrease in global neupogen® sales for 2014 was driven by the $155-million order from the u.s. government in 2013. excluding the special order, u.s. and global sales declined 17% and 7%, respectively, which reflected decreases in unit demand in the united states, offset partially by the increased sales as a result of acquiring rights to filgrastim in certain regions effective january 1, 2014. in december 2014, the fda granted approval of the neulasta® delivery kit, including the on-body injector for neulasta®, which enables the healthcare provider to initiate administration of neulasta® on the same day as cytotoxic chemotherapy with delivery of the patient's full dose of neulasta® the day following chemotherapy administration, consistent with the neulasta® prescribing information.
the increase in global neulasta® sales for 2013 was driven by an increase in the average net sales price in the united states, offset partially by a decline in units. the increase in global neupogen® sales for 2013 was driven by the $155-million order from the u.s. government. excluding the special order, u.s. sales grew only 1% and global sales declined 1%. units declined in 2013 in both the united states and row.
our material u.s. patents for filgrastim (neupogen®) expired in december 2013. we face competition in the united states, which could have an impact over time on future sales of neupogen® and, to a lesser extent, neulasta®. our outstanding material u.s. patent for pegfilgrastim (neulasta®) expires in 2015. apotex, inc. announced that the fda accepted for filing their applications, under the abbreviated pathway, for pegfilgrastim, a biosimilar version of neulasta®, on december 17, 2014, and for filgrastim, a biosimilar version of neupogen®, on february 17, 2015. on january 7, 2015, sandoz, a novartis company, announced that the fda odac recommended approval of its investigational biosimilar filgrastim. the sandoz biosimilar filgrastim is the subject of ongoing litigation between us and sandoz.
see part 1, item 1. business-marketing, distribution and selected marketed products-competition and part iv-note 18, contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements.
future neulasta®/neupogen® sales will also depend, in part, on the development of new protocols, tests and/or treatments for cancer and/or new chemotherapy treatments or alternatives to chemotherapy that may have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of chemotherapy in some patients.

the increase in enbrel sales for 2014 was driven primarily by an increase in the average net sales price offset partially by unfavorable changes in wholesaler and, based on prescription data, end-user inventories.
the increase in enbrel sales for 2013 was driven primarily by an increase in the average net sales price offset partially by slight unit declines.

the increases in global xgeva® and prolia® sales for 2014 and 2013 were driven primarily by unit growth.

the increase in epogen® sales for 2014 was driven by an increase in the average net sales price offset partially by unit declines.
epogen® sales for 2013 increased by 1% due to unit growth.
our remaining material u.s. patent for epogen® expires in may 2015. as a result, we may face competition in the united states, which may have a material adverse impact over time on epogen® sales. in addition, epogen® and aranesp® will face competition from the launch of mircera® in the united states. roche began selling mircera® in october 2014 in the united states under terms of a limited patent license obtained from amgen in connection with the settlement of patent litigation. mircera® competes with aranesp® in the nephrology segment only. on december 16, 2014, hospira, inc. submitted a bla to the fda for retacrittm, a proposed biosimilar to epogen®, under the abbreviated pathway.
in addition, future epogen® sales will also depend, in part, on such factors as response to changes in reimbursement, including the reduction to the esrd payment bundle effective january 1, 2014, and changes in dose utilization as healthcare providers continue to refine their treatment practices in accordance with approved labeling. see part 1, item 1. business-marketing, distribution and selected marketed products-competition.

the increase in u.s. aranesp® sales for 2014 was driven by an increase in the average net sales price and, to a lesser extent, unit demand. the decrease in row aranesp® sales for 2014 reflects price declines offset partially by unit demand in international markets.
the decrease in u.s. aranesp® sales for 2013 was driven by declines in unit demand. the unit declines reflect changes in practice patterns resulting from changes to the label and to the reimbursement environment that occurred during 2011.
the decrease in row aranesp® sales for 2013 reflects unit declines and price pressure in europe.

the increases in global sensipar®/mimpara® sales for 2014 and 2013 were driven primarily by unit growth and increases in the average net sales price in the united states; however, the increases in 2014 were offset partially by unfavorable changes in u.s. wholesaler and, based on prescription data, end-user inventories.

restructuring we announced a restructuring plan during the second half of 2014 to invest in continuing innovation and the launch of our new pipeline molecules while improving our cost structure. as part of the plan, we stated that we would reduce our staff by 3,500 to 4,000 by the end of 2015 and close our facilities in washington state and colorado and reduce the number of buildings at our headquarters in thousand oaks, california. company-wide, these actions will result in an approximate 23% reduction in our facilities footprint.
we estimate that these actions will result in pre-tax accounting charges in the range of $935 million to $1,035 million. during the year ended december 31, 2014, we initiated the above-noted actions and incurred $558 million of restructuring costs. we expect that substantially all remaining restructuring actions and related estimated costs will be incurred in 2015.
net savings were not significant in 2014 due to investments in later stage clinical programs, new product launch preparation and external business development.
additional information required for our restructuring plan is incorporated herein by reference to part iv-note 2, restructuring and other cost savings initiatives, to the consolidated financial statements.
cost of sales cost of sales increased to 22.0% of total revenues for 2014, driven by acquisition-related expenses that included an increase of $642 million of non-cash amortization of intangible assets acquired in the onyx acquisition. the year ended december 31, 2014, also included impairment and accelerated depreciation charges pursuant to our restructuring initiative of $104 million and a $99-million charge related to the termination of the supply contract with roche as a result of acquiring the licenses to filgrastim and pegfilgrastim effective january 1, 2014.
cost of sales decreased to 17.9% of total revenues for 2013, driven primarily by lower royalties and higher average net sales prices, offset partially by changes in product mix. the excise tax imposed by puerto rico on the gross intercompany purchase price of goods and services from our manufacturer in puerto rico (puerto rico excise tax) also slightly contributed to the decrease. the rate was 3.75% in 2012, 2.75% in the first half of 2013 and 4.0% effective july 1, 2013 through december 31, 2017. see part iv-note 5, income taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the puerto rico excise tax.
excluding the impact of the excise tax, cost of sales would have been 20.1%, 16.0% and 16.5% of total revenues for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
research and development r&d costs are expensed as incurred and include primarily salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs; facilities and overhead costs; clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs; contract services and other outside costs; information systems' costs and amortization of acquired technology used in r&d with alternative future uses. r&d expenses also include costs and cost recoveries associated with k-a and third-party r&d arrangements, including upfront fees and milestones paid to third parties in connection with technologies which had not reached technological feasibility and did not have an alternative future use. net payment or reimbursement of r&d costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or as we become entitled to the cost recovery.
the company groups all of its r&d activities and related expenditures into three categories: (1) discovery research and translational sciences (drts), (2) later stage clinical programs and (3) marketed products. these categories include the company's r&d activities as set forth in the following table:
category                        description drts                            r&amp;d expenses incurred in activities substantially in support of early research through the completion of phase 1 clinical trials. these activities encompass our drts functions, including drug discovery, toxicology, pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism, and process development.
later stage clinical programs   r&amp;d expenses incurred in or related to phase 2 and phase 3 clinical programs intended to result in registration of a new product or a new indication for an existing product in the united states or the eu.
marketed products               r&amp;d expenses incurred in support of the company's marketed products that are authorized to be sold in the united states or the eu. includes clinical trials designed to gather information on product safety (certain of which may be required by regulatory authorities) and their product characteristics after regulatory approval has been obtained, as well as the costs of obtaining regulatory approval of a product in a new market after approval in either the united states or the eu has been obtained.
marketed products                     798                   900                   958
the increase in r&d expense for 2014 was driven primarily by increased costs of $326 million associated with onyx across all categories of r&d spend, as well as increased costs associated with other later stage clinical program support. overall, costs associated with later stage clinical programs support increased $337 million, offset partially by reduced expenses associated with marketed products support of $102 million and drts activities of $21 million. drts expenses included a $60 million upfront payment related to our cancer immunotherapy collaboration with kite pharma, inc.
the increase in r&d expense for 2013 was driven primarily by an increase of $665 million in our later stage clinical programs, including evolocumab and kyprolis®; and an increase of $96 million in drts activities, offset partially by reduced expenses associated with marketed products support of $58 million.
selling, general and administrative sg&a expenses are comprised primarily of salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs associated with sales and marketing, finance, legal and other administrative personnel; facilities and overhead costs; outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses; the bpd fee; and other general and administrative costs. advertising costs are expensed as incurred. sg&a expenses also include costs and cost recoveries associated with marketing and promotion efforts under certain collaboration arrangements. net payment or reimbursement of sg&a costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or we become entitled to the cost recovery.
the decrease in sg&a expense for 2014 was driven primarily by the expiration of the enbrel profit share in october 2013, which reduced expenses by $818 million. that decline was offset partially by the addition of $183 million as a result of the onyx acquisition, an additional $129 million accrual for the bpd fee as the final regulations accelerated the expense recognition criteria for the fee obligation by one year and increased commercial expenses of $109 million in preparation for new product launches.
historically, under our enbrel collaboration agreement, we paid pfizer a percentage of annual gross profits on our enbrel sales in the united states and canada on a scale that increased with gross profits. the enbrel co-promotion term expired on october 31, 2013, and we are required to pay pfizer residual royalties on a declining percentage of net enbrel sales in the united states and canada. the royalty percentage was 12% through october 31, 2014, declining to 11% through october 31, 2015 and 10% through october 31, 2016.
the increase in sg&a expense for 2013 was driven primarily by the addition of onyx of $276 million, of which $215 million was acquisition-related. included in these costs are advisory, legal and regulatory costs, and compensation-related payments. the compensation payments include cash payments for accelerated vesting of equity awards as part of the acquisition that were previously granted under the onyx equity award programs which would not have otherwise vested. sg&a also increased by $98 million related primarily to favorable changes in 2012 to the estimated bpd fee.
other other operating expenses for 2014 included certain charges related to our restructuring plan, primarily separation costs of $377 million. it also included a $46 million write-off of a non-key ipr&d program acquired in a prior year business combination.
other operating expenses for 2013 included $113 million of adjustments to our estimated contingent consideration liability related to the biovex group, inc. (biovex) business combination, certain charges related to our other cost savings initiatives of $71 million, which included severance expenses, and $12 million of other charges related primarily to legal proceedings.
other operating expenses for 2012 included charges of $175 million related to our other cost savings initiatives, which included severance and expenses associated with abandoning leased facilities, legal charges of $64 million and other operating expenses of $56 million, comprised primarily of adjustments to our estimated contingent consideration liability related to the biovex business combination.
non-operating expenses/income and provision for income taxes non-operating expenses/income and provision for income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):
provision for income taxes            $427                  $184                  $664
interest expense, net the increase in interest expense, net in 2014 was due primarily to a higher average balance of debt outstanding offset partially by lower average borrowing rates compared with 2013. the decrease in interest expense, net in 2013 compared with 2012 was due primarily to the decrease in non-cash interest resulting from the settlement of our 0.375% 2013 convertible notes in february 2013 offset partially by increases resulting from the higher average balance of other outstanding debt and financing fees paid in association with the acquisition of onyx.
interest and other income, net the increase in interest and other income, net for 2014 compared with 2013 was due primarily to interest earned as a result of a higher average balance of cash and investments offset partially by a reduction in income realized from the sale of investments recognized in 2014. the decrease in interest and other income, net for 2013 compared with 2012 was due primarily to a reduction in income from the sale of investments recognized in 2013.
income taxes the increase in our effective tax rate for 2014 compared with 2013 was due primarily to two significant events that occurred during 2013. first, the settlement of our examination with the internal revenue service (irs) for the years ended december 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009, in which we agreed to certain adjustments proposed by the irs and remeasured our unrecognized tax benefits (utbs) accordingly, resulting in a benefit of approximately $185 million. second, because the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was not enacted until 2013, certain provisions of the act benefiting the company's 2012 federal taxes, including the retroactive extension of the r&d tax credit for 2012, were not recognized in the company's 2012 financial results and instead are reflected in the company's 2013 financial results. therefore, our effective tax rate for 2013 included an additional $70 million benefit for the full-year 2012 r&d tax credit. the increase was offset partially by the favorable tax impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses due primarily to higher domestic acquisition-related expenses and restructuring costs in 2014.
the decrease in our effective rate for 2013 compared with 2012 was due primarily to three significant events occurring in 2013: (i) we settled our examination with the irs for the years ended december 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009, as discussed above; (ii) costs associated with the acquisition of onyx, which resulted in a tax benefit of approximately $180 million; and (iii) the reinstatement of the federal r&d tax credit for 2012 and 2013, as discussed above. additionally, our rate was further reduced by the favorable tax impact of changes in the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses.
the effective tax rates for 2014, 2013 and 2012 would have been approximately 12.8%, 9.2%, and 18.7%, respectively, without the impact of the tax credits associated with the puerto rico excise tax.
as permitted under u.s. gaap, we do not provide for u.s. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the united states.

the company intends to continue to return capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and share repurchases, reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. the amount we spend, the number of shares repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including the stock price, the availability of financing on acceptable terms, the amount and timing of dividends and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares; and the manner of purchases may include private block purchases, tender offers and market transactions.
whether and when we declare dividends and the size of any dividend could be affected by a number of additional factors. (see part i, item 1a. risk factors-there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or that we will repurchase stock). the board of directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.36 per share of common stock in 2012, increased our quarterly cash dividend by 31% to $0.47 per share of common stock in 2013 and increased our quarterly cash dividend by 30% to $0.61 per share of common stock in 2014. in december 2014, the board of directors declared a dividend of $0.79 per share of common stock, an increase of 30%, to be paid in march 2015.
the company has also returned capital to stockholders through its stock repurchase program. during 2012, we spent $4.6 billion to repurchase shares of our common stock, and an additional $832 million during the first quarter of 2013, after which repurchases were temporarily suspended. in october 2014, the board of directors authorized an increase to the stock repurchase program that resulted in a total of $4.0 billion available. we reinitiated repurchasing activity under the program and, during the fourth quarter of 2014, we repurchased $153 million of stock, of which $138 million was paid in cash by december 31, 2014. as of december 31, 2014, $3.8 billion remains available under the board of directors-approved stock repurchase program.
we believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. we anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or our syndicated credit facilities and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. with respect to our u.s. operations, we believe that existing funds intended for use in the united states; cash generated from our u.s. operations, including intercompany payments and receipts; and existing sources of and access to financing (collectively referred to as "u.s. funds") are adequate to continue to meet our u.s. obligations (including our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock with u.s. funds) for the foreseeable future. see part i, item 1a. risk factors-global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.
a significant portion of our operating cash flows is dependent on the timing of payments from our customers located in the united states and, to a lesser extent, our customers outside the united states, which include government-owned or -supported healthcare providers (government healthcare providers). payments from these government healthcare providers are dependent in part on the economic stability and creditworthiness of their applicable country. historically, some payments from a number of european government healthcare providers have extended beyond the contractual terms of sale, and regional economic uncertainty continues. in particular, credit and economic conditions in southern europe, particularly in spain, italy, greece and portugal, continue to adversely impact the timing of collections of our trade receivables in this region. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, accounts receivable in these four countries totaled $223 million and $419 million, respectively. of these receivables, $124 million and $301 million were past due as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. although economic conditions in this region may continue to affect the average length of time it takes to collect payments, to date we have not incurred any significant losses related to these receivables; and the timing of payments in these countries has not had nor is it currently expected to have a material adverse impact on our overall operating cash flows. however, if government funding for healthcare were to become unavailable in these countries or if significant adverse adjustments to past payment practices were to occur, we might not be able to collect the entire balance of these receivables. we will continue working closely with these customers, monitoring the economic situation and taking appropriate actions as necessary.
cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling approximately $27.0 billion as of december 31, 2014, approximately $25.7 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside the united states. under current tax laws, if these funds were repatriated for use in our u.s. operations, we would be required to pay additional income taxes at the tax rates then in effect.
the primary objective of our investment portfolio is to enhance overall returns in an efficient manner while maintaining safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. our investment policy limits interest-bearing security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer.
financing arrangements the current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings at december 31, 2014, were $0.5 billion and $30.2 billion, respectively. the current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings at december 31, 2013, were $2.5 billion and $29.6 billion, respectively. as of december 31, 2014, standard & poor's financial services llc (s&p), moody's investor service, inc. (moody's) and fitch, inc. (fitch) assigned credit ratings to our outstanding senior notes of a with a stable outlook, baa1 with a stable outlook and bbb with a negative outlook, respectively, which are considered investment grade. unfavorable changes to these ratings may have an adverse impact on future financings and would affect the interest rate paid under our term loan credit facility.
during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we issued long-term debt with aggregate principal amounts of $4.5 billion, $8.1 billion, and $5.0 billion, respectively. during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we repaid debt of $5.6 billion, $3.4 billion, and $123 million, respectively. for information regarding specific issuances and repayments of debt, see part iv-note 14, financing arrangements, to the consolidated financial statements.
to achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating london interbank offered rates (libor)-based coupon over the life of the respective note. these interest rate swap contracts qualified and are designated as fair value hedges. in 2014 and 2013, we entered into interest rate swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $2.25 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively. in addition, we previously had interest rate swap contracts on debt with an aggregate face value of $3.6 billion which, due to historically low interest rates, were terminated in may 2012. see part iv-note 14, financing arrangements, and note 17, derivative instruments, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our interest rate swap contracts.
to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our long-term notes denominated in foreign currencies, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts, which effectively convert the interest payments and principal repayment of the respective notes from euros/pounds sterling to u.s. dollars. these cross-currency swap contracts qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, we had cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $2.7 billion. see part iv-note 17, derivative instruments, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our cross-currency swap contracts.
as of december 31, 2014, we had a commercial paper program that allows us to issue up to $2.5 billion of unsecured commercial paper to fund our working capital needs. at december 31, 2014 and 2013, we had no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program.
in july 2014, we entered into a $2.5 billion syndicated, unsecured, revolving credit agreement which is available for general corporate purposes or as a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program. this agreement amended and restated our previous revolving credit agreement on substantially similar terms. the commitments under the revolving credit agreement may be increased by up to $500 million with the agreement of the banks. each bank which is a party to the agreement has an initial commitment term of five years. this term may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods with the agreement of the banks. annual commitment fees for this agreement are 0.1% based on our current credit rating. generally, we would be charged interest at libor plus 0.9% for any amounts borrowed under this facility. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, no amounts were outstanding under this facility.
in february 2014, we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec which allows us to issue unspecified amounts of debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depository shares; rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock; securities purchase contracts; securities purchase units; and depository shares. under this shelf registration statement, all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. this shelf registration statement expires in february 2017.
in 1997, we established a $400 million medium-term note program under which medium-term debt securities may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013, no securities were outstanding under this medium-term note program.
certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants. in addition, our revolving credit agreement and term loan credit facility each includes a financial covenant with respect to the level of our borrowings in relation to our equity, as defined. we were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of december 31, 2014.
see part iv-note 14, financing arrangements, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our financing arrangements.
cash flows a summary of our cash flow activity was as follows (in millions):
net cash provided by operating activities                $8,555                $6,291                $5,882
net cash used in investing activities                    (5,752    )           (8,469    )           (9,990    )
net cash (used in) provided by financing activities      (2,877    )            2,726                   419
operating cash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. cash provided by operating activities increased during 2014 due primarily to higher revenues, higher operating income, including the impact of the expiration of the enbrel co-promotion term on october 31, 2013, and improvements in working capital. cash provided by operating activities increased during 2013 due primarily to the 2012 impacts of the payment associated with a legal settlement and higher payments to taxing authorities, offset partially by cash receipts in 2012 of $397 million in connection with the termination of interest rate swap agreements and $197 million received under a government-funded program in spain with regard to trade receivables.
investing capital expenditures, which were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in singapore, puerto rico and ireland, as well as other site developments, totaled $718 million, $693 million and $689 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. we currently estimate 2015 spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately $800 million.
cash used in investing activities during the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, also included the cost of acquiring certain businesses, net of cash acquired, which totaled $165 million, $9.4 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively. in addition, during the year ended december 31, 2014, $285 million was used to purchase intangible assets.
net activity related to marketable securities and restricted investments used $4.4 billion for 2014 and provided $1.7 billion for 2013. net purchases of marketable securities totaled $6.9 billion for 2012.
financing cash used in financing activities during 2014 was due primarily to the repayment of long-term debt of $5.6 billion, the payment of dividends of $1.9 billion and repurchases of our common stock of $138 million. these payments were offset partially by net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $4.5 billion and net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the company's equity award programs of $186 million. cash provided by financing activities during 2013 was due primarily to net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $8.1 billion and net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the company's equity award programs of $296 million. these receipts were offset partially by the repayment of long-term debt of $3.4 billion, the payment of dividends of $1.4 billion and repurchases of our common stock of $832 million. cash used in financing activities during 2012 was due primarily to net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $4.9 billion and net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the company's equity award programs of $1.3 billion, offset partially by repurchases of common stock of $4.6 billion and the payment of dividends of $1.1 billion.
see part iv-note 14, financing arrangements, and note 15, stockholders' equity, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
off-balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations.
contractual obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment. additionally, the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information. timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations.
(1)   long-term debt obligations include future interest payments which are included in our financing arrangements at the fixed contractual coupon rates. to achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap contracts that effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating libor-based coupon over the life of the respective note. we used an interest rate forward curve at december 31, 2014, in computing net amounts to be paid or received under our interest rate swap contracts which resulted in an aggregate net increase in future interest payments of $272 million. see part iv-note 14, financing arrangements, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our interest swap contracts.
(2)   long-term debt obligations include future interest payments under our term loan at libor-based variable rates of interest. we used an interest rate forward curve at december 31, 2014, in computing interest payments on this debt obligation. see part iv-note 14, financing arrangements, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this debt obligation.
(3)   long-term debt obligations include contractual interest payments and principal repayment of our foreign denominated debt obligations. in order to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our pound sterling and euro denominated long-term debt, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts that effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment on this debt from euros/pounds sterling to u.s. dollars. for purposes of this table, we used the contracted exchange rates in the cross-currency swap contracts to compute the net amounts of future interest payments and principal repayments on this debt. see part iv-note 17, derivative instruments, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our cross-currency swap contracts.
(4)   interest payments and the repayment of principal on our 4.375% 2018 euro notes were translated into u.s. dollars at the foreign currency exchange rate in effect at december 31, 2014. see part iv-note 14, financing arrangements, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our long-term debt obligations.
(5)   purchase obligations relate primarily to: (i) r&amp;d commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products; (ii) capital expenditures; (iii) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business; and (iv) a $225 million payment due to the former shareholders of proteolix, inc. in settlement of contingent consideration assumed in the acquisition of onyx (see note 16, fair value measurement to the consolidated financial statements). our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events.
(6)   liabilities for utbs (net of foreign tax credits and federal tax benefit of state taxes) and related accrued interest and penalties totaling approximately $1.7 billion at december 31, 2014, are not included in the table above because, due to their nature, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities.
in addition to amounts in the table above, we are contractually obligated to pay additional amounts, which in the aggregate are significant, upon the achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones for agreements we have entered into with third parties, including contingent consideration incurred in the acquisition of biovex. these payments are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, substantially all of which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring. these contingent payments have not been included in the table above, and, except with respect to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations, are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. as of december 31, 2014, the maximum amount that may be payable in the future for agreements we have entered into with third parties is approximately $3.0 billion, including $450 million of contingent consideration payments in connection with the acquisition of biovex. see part iv-note 16, fair value measurement to the consolidated financial statements.
summary of critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
product sales and sales deductions revenues from sales of our products are recognized when the products are shipped and title and risk of loss have passed. product sales are recorded net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, cash discounts and other deductions (collectively, "sales deductions") and returns, which are established at the time of sale.
we analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. amounts recorded in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets for sales deductions were as follows (in millions):
amounts charged against product sales       1,480                2,709                       659               4,848
amounts charged against product sales       1,784                3,008                       669               5,461
amounts charged against product sales       2,499                3,399                       688               6,586
for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, total sales deductions were 25%, 23% and 23% of gross product sales, respectively. included in these amounts are immaterial adjustments related to prior-year sales due to changes in estimates. such amounts represent 3% or less of the aggregate sales deductions charged against product sales in each of the three years ended december 31, 2014.
in the united states, we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers, such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. products we sell in europe are distributed principally to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending on the distribution practice in each country where the product is sold. we monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesalers by using data from our wholesalers and other third parties, and we believe wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sales deductions and returns.
accruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. these estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. sales deductions are substantially product-specific and, therefore, for any given year, can be impacted by the mix of products sold.
rebates include primarily amounts paid to payers and providers in the united states, including those paid to state medicaid programs, and are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements which vary by product, by payer and individual payer plans. as we sell product, we estimate the amount of rebate that will be paid by us based on the product sold, contractual terms, estimated patient population, historical experience and wholesaler inventory levels and accrue these rebates in the period the related sale is recorded. we then adjust the rebate accruals as more information becomes available and to reflect actual claims experience. estimating such rebates is complicated, in part, due to the time delay between the date of sale and the actual settlement of the liability, which can take more than one year. we believe the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances. however, actual results may differ. for example, we had managed medicaid rebate adjustments of $164 million in 2013. changes in annual estimates related to prior annual periods were less than 2% of the estimated rebate amounts charged against product sales for the year ended december 31, 2014, and less than 10% for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, including the aforementioned adjustment. a 10% change in our rebate estimate attributable to rebates recognized in 2014 would have had an impact of approximately $250 million, or approximately 1% of our 2014 product sales and a corresponding impact on our financial condition and liquidity.
wholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the united states at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers. when healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, wholesalers charge us for the difference between their purchase price and the contractual price between amgen and the healthcare providers. the provision for chargebacks is based on the expected sales by our wholesaler customers to healthcare providers. accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates and closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare providers, and we generally settle the liability for these deductions within a few weeks.
product returns returns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. in each of the last three years, sales return provisions have amounted to less than 1% of gross product sales. changes in estimates for prior year sales return provisions have historically been insignificant.
income taxes the company provides for income taxes based on pretax income and applicable tax rates available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates.
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements on a particular tax position are measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. the amount of utbs is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of an examination. we believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for any assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. we recognize both accrued interest and penalties, where appropriate, related to utbs in income tax expense.
certain items are included in the company's tax return at different times than they are reflected in the financial statements and cause temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. such temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. deferred tax assets are generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years but for which the company has already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. the company establishes valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. deferred tax liabilities are either: (i) tax expenses recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred; (ii) expenses for which the company has already taken a deduction on the tax return, but has not yet recognized the expense in the financial statements; or (iii) liabilities for the difference between the book basis and tax basis of the intangible assets acquired in many business combinations, as future expenses associated with these assets most often will not be tax deductible.
the company is a vertically integrated enterprise with operations in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions. the company is subject to income tax in the foreign jurisdictions where it conducts activities based on the tax laws and principles of such jurisdictions and the functions, risks and activities performed therein. the company's pretax income is therefore attributed to domestic or foreign sources based on the operations performed in each location and the tax laws and principles of the respective taxing jurisdictions. for example, the company conducts significant operations outside the united states in puerto rico pertaining to manufacturing, distribution and other related functions to meet its worldwide product demand. income from the company's operations in puerto rico is subject to a tax incentive grant that expires in 2020.
our effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no u.s. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the united states. substantially all of this benefit is attributable to the company's foreign income associated with the company's operations conducted in puerto rico.
if future events, including material changes in cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the united states, under current tax laws an additional tax provision and related liability would be required at the applicable income tax rates which could have a material adverse effect on both our future effective tax rate and our financial results.
our operations are subject to the tax laws, regulations and administrative practices of the united states, u.s. state jurisdictions and other countries in which we do business. significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations. see part i, item 1a. risk factors-the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability.
contingencies in the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings and other matters such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes, governmental investigations and class action suits which are complex in nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. certain of these proceedings are discussed in part iv-note 18, contingencies and commitments, to the consolidated financial statements. we record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. we consider all relevant factors when making assessments regarding these contingencies.
while it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these items, an adverse determination in one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
valuation of assets and liabilities in connection with business combinations we have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations. these intangible assets consist primarily of technology associated with currently marketed human therapeutic products and ipr&d product candidates. discounted cash flow models are typically used to determine the fair values of these intangible assets for purposes of allocating consideration paid to the net assets acquired in a business combination. these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to:
•   determining the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects taking into account the stage of completion at the acquisition date;
•   projecting the probability and timing of obtaining marketing approval from the fda and other regulatory agencies for product candidates;
•   estimating the timing of and future net cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects; and
•   developing appropriate discount rates to calculate the present values of the cash flows.
significant estimates and assumptions are also required to determine the acquisition date fair values of any contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations. in addition, we must revalue these obligations each subsequent reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved and record changes in their fair values in earnings. the acquisition date fair values of various contingent consideration obligations incurred or assumed in the acquisitions of businesses (see part iv-note 3, business combinations, and note 16, fair value measurement, to the consolidated financial statements) were determined using a combination of valuation techniques. significant estimates and assumptions required for these valuations included, but were not limited to, the probability of achieving regulatory milestones, product sales projections under various scenarios and discount rates used to calculate the present value of the required payments. these estimates and assumptions are required to be updated in order to revalue these contingent consideration obligations each reporting period. accordingly, subsequent changes in underlying facts and circumstances could result in changes in these estimates and assumptions, which could have a material impact on the estimated future fair values of these obligations.
we believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired and contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates.
impairment of long-lived assets we review the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment and our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. if such circumstances exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the long-lived asset is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. if an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset's fair value and its carrying value.
indefinite-lived intangible assets, composed of ipr&d projects acquired in a business combination which have not reached technological feasibility, are reviewed annually for impairment and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. we determine impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value. if the asset's carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference and its carrying value is reduced accordingly.
estimating future cash flows of an ipr&d product candidate for purposes of an impairment analysis requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of costs to complete the project and the amount, timing and probability of achieving revenues from the completed product similar to how the acquisition date fair value of the project was determined, as described above. there are often major risks and uncertainties associated with ipr&d projects as we are required to obtain regulatory approvals in order to be able to market these products. such approvals require completing clinical trials that demonstrate a product candidate is safe and effective. consequently, the eventual realized value of the acquired ipr&d project may vary from its estimated fair value at the date of acquisition, and ipr&d impairment charges may occur in future periods which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
we believe our estimations of future cash flows used for assessing impairment of long-lived assets are based on reasonable assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related dates of the assessments.

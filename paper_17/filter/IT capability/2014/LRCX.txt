item 1a.   risk factors in addition to the other information in this 2014 form 10-k, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business because such factors may significantly impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. as a result of these risk factors, as well as other risks discussed in our other sec filings, our actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. no priority or significance is intended, nor should be attached, to the order in which the risk factors appear.
the semiconductor equipment industry is subject to fluctuations and, as a result, we face risks related to our strategic resource allocation decisions the business cycle in the semiconductor equipment industry has historically been characterized by frequent periods of rapid change in demand that challenge our management to adjust spending and other resources allocated to operating activities. during periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services, we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems, procedures for training and managing our work force, and in appropriately sizing our supply chain infrastructure, work force, and other components of our business on a timely basis. if we do not adequately meet these challenges during periods of demand decline, our gross margins and earnings may be negatively impacted.
we continuously reassess our strategic resource allocation choices in response to the changing business environment. if we do not adequately adapt to the changing business environment, we may lack the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during a period of growth, or we may expand our capacity too rapidly and/or beyond what is appropriate for the actual demand environment.
especially during transitional periods, resource allocation decisions can have a significant impact on our future performance, particularly if we have not accurately anticipated industry changes. our success will depend, to a significant extent, on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively.
future declines in the semiconductor industry, and the overall world economic conditions on which it is significantly dependent, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers, which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits. the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and experiences periodic downturns. global economic and business conditions, which are often unpredictable, have historically impacted customer demand for our products and normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers, and creditors. additionally, in times of economic uncertainty our customers' budgets for our products, or their ability to access credit to purchase them, could be adversely affected. this would limit their ability to purchase our products and services. as a result, economic downturns can cause material adverse changes to our results of operations and financial condition including, but not limited to:
   an increase in reserves on accounts receivable due to our customers' inability to pay us;
   an increase in reserves on inventory balances due to excess or obsolete inventory as a result of our inability to sell such inventory;
   exposure to claims from our suppliers for payment on inventory that is ordered in anticipation of customer purchases that do not come to fruition;
   a decline in the value of certain facilities we lease to less than our residual value guarantee with the lessor; and fluctuating levels of investment by semiconductor manufacturers may materially affect our aggregate shipments, revenues, operating results and earnings. where appropriate, we will attempt to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams, which sometimes result in restructuring charges. even during periods of reduced revenues, we must continue to invest in r&d and maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive, which may temporarily harm our profitability and other financial results.
future revenues. because our operating expenses are based in part on anticipated future revenues, and a certain amount of those expenses are relatively fixed, a change in the timing of recognition of revenue and/or the level of gross profit from a small number of transactions can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter. factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include, but are not limited to:
   economic conditions in the electronics and semiconductor industries in general and specifically the semiconductor equipment industry;
   the failure of our suppliers or outsource providers to perform their obligations in a manner consistent with our expectations;
   our ability in a timely manner to develop, introduce and market new, enhanced, and competitive products;
   our competitors' introduction of new products;
   transportation, communication, demand, information technology or supply disruptions based on factors outside our control such as strikes, acts of god, wars, terrorist activities, and natural disasters;
   legal, tax, accounting, or regulatory changes (including but not limited to change in import/export regulations) or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing requirements;
we may incur impairments to goodwill or long-lived assets we review our long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets, for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. negative industry or economic trends, including reduced market prices of our common stock, reduced estimates of future cash flows, disruptions to our business, slower growth rates, or lack of growth in our relevant business segments, could lead to impairment charges against our long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets. if, in any period, our stock price decreases to the point where our fair value, as determined by our market capitalization, is less than the book value of our assets, this could also indicate a potential impairment, and we may be required to record an impairment charge in that period, which could adversely affect our result of operations.
our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance. we operate in a highly competitive environment and projections of future operating result and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results. additionally, if our analysis indicates potential impairment to goodwill one or more of our business segments, we may be required to record additional charges to earnings in our financial statements, which could negatively affect our results of operations. as a result of historical performance and growth potential, our single-wafer clean systems reporting unit may be at greater risk for goodwill impairment than our other reporting units if our actual results for this reporting unit differ from our projections.
our leverage and debt service obligations and potential note conversion or related hedging activities may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and earnings per share as a result of the sale of our 2016 and 2018 convertible notes and the assumption of the 2041 convertible notes in connection with our acquisition of novellus systems, inc. (collectively the "notes"), we have a greater amount of debt than we have maintained in the past. our maintenance of higher levels of indebtedness could have adverse consequences including:
   impacting our ability to satisfy our obligations;
   increasing the portion of our cash flows that may have to be dedicated to interest and principal payments and may not be available for operations, working capital, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes; and
   impairing our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.
our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. furthermore, our operations may not generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to meet our expenses and service our debt. as a result, we may need to enter into new financing arrangements to obtain the necessary funds. if we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason, we may not be able to obtain such funding or, if funding is available, obtain it on acceptable terms. if we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt, and this default could cause us to be in default on our other outstanding indebtedness.
conversion of our notes may cause dilution to our shareholders and to our earnings per share. upon conversion of any notes, we will deliver cash in the amount of the principal amount of the notes and, with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the notes, shares of our common stock, which would result in dilution to our shareholders. this dilution may be mitigated to some extent by the hedging transactions we entered into in connection with the sale of the 2016 and 2018 notes or through share repurchases. prior to the maturity of the notes, if the price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price, u.s. generally accepted accounting principles require that we report an increase in diluted share count, which would result in lower reported earnings per share. the price of our common stock could also be affected by sales of our common stock by investors who view the notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in our company and also by hedging activity that may develop involving our common stock by holders of the notes.
our credit agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business.
we may be unable to respond to changes in business and economic conditions, engage in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us, or obtain additional financing, because our debt agreements contain, and any of our other future similar agreements may contain, covenant restrictions that limit our ability to, among other things:
   incur additional debt, assume obligations in connection with letters of credit, or issue guarantees;
   enter into transactions with our affiliates;
   merge or consolidate with any person.
our ability to comply with these covenants is dependent on our future performance, which will be subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including prevailing economic conditions. in addition, our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the notes or our other debt, which could permit the holders to accelerate such debt. if any of our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt, which could materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operation.
we have a limited number of key customers sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue, shipments, cash flows, collections and profitability. as a result, the actions of even one customer may subject us to variability in those areas that are difficult to predict. in addition, large customers may be able to negotiate requirements that result in decreased pricing; increased costs and/or lower margins for us; compliance to specific environmental, social and corporate governance standards; and limitations on our ability to share jointly developed technology with others. similarly, significant portions of our credit risk may, at any given time, be concentrated among a limited number of customers, so that the failure of even one of these key customers to pay its obligations to us could significantly impact our financial results.
we depend on new products and processes for our success. consequently, we are subject to risks associated with rapid technological change rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances that enable those processes. we believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products. if new products have reliability, quality, or design problems, our performance may be impacted by reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance of and payment for new products, and additional service and warranty expenses. we may be unable to develop and manufacture new products successfully, or new products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace. the expected industry transition to a 450mm platform represents an emerging challenge for our business, and our failure to address that transition in a timely manner with productive and cost-effective products could adversely affect our business in a material way. our failure to commercialize new products in a timely manner could result in loss of market share, unanticipated costs, and inventory obsolescence, which would adversely affect our financial results.
in order to develop new products and processes, we expect to continue to make significant investments in r&d and to pursue joint development relationships with customers, suppliers or other members of the industry. we must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully, as the introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products and certain jointly developed technologies may be subject to restrictions on our ability to share that technology with other customers, which could limit our market for products incorporating those technologies. future technologies, processes or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete, leaving us with non-competitive products, or obsolete inventory, or both. moreover, customers may adopt new technologies or processes to address the complex challenges associated with next generation devices. this shift may result in a reduction in the size of our addressable markets or could increase the relative size of markets in which we either do not compete or have relatively low market share.
we are subject to risks relating to product concentration and lack of product revenue diversification we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products. system sales constitute a significant portion of our total revenue. our systems are priced up to approximately $9 million per system, and our revenues in any given quarter are dependent upon customer acceptance of a limited number of systems. as a result, the inability to recognize revenue on even a few systems can cause a significantly adverse impact on our revenues for a given quarter, and, in the longer term, the continued market acceptance of these products is critical to our future success. our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by:
   a decline in demand for even a limited number of our products;
   export restrictions or other regulatory or legislative actions that could limit our ability to sell those products to key customer or market segments;
   an improved version of products being offered by a competitor in the market in which we participate;
   increased pressure from competitors that offer broader product lines;
   technological changes that we are unable to address with our products; or in addition, the fact that we offer limited product lines creates the risk that our customers may view us as less important to their business than our competitors that offer additional products. this may impact our ability to maintain or expand our business with certain customers. such product concentration may also subject us to additional risks associated with technology changes. our business is affected by our customers' use of our products in certain steps in their wafer fabrication processes. should technologies change so that the manufacture of semiconductors requires fewer steps using our products, this could have a larger impact on our business than it would on the business of our less concentrated competitors.
strategic alliances and customer consolidation may have negative effects on our business increasingly, semiconductor manufacturing companies are entering into strategic alliances or consolidating with one another to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies and/or achieve economies of scale. the outcomes of such an alliance can be the definition of a particular tool set for a certain function and/or the standardization of a series of process steps that use a specific set of manufacturing equipment; while the outcomes of consolidation can lead to an overall reduction in the market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment as customers' operations achieve economies of scale and/or increased purchasing power based on their higher volumes. in certain instances this could work to our disadvantage if a competitor's tools or equipment become the standard equipment for such functions or processes. some semiconductor manufacturing companies are also consolidating. additional outcomes of such consolidation may include our customers: (i) re-evaluating their future supplier relationships to consider other competitors' products and/or (ii) gaining additional influence over the pricing of products and the control of intellectual property.
similarly, our customers may partner with, or follow the lead of, educational or research institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps. if those institutions utilize a competitor's equipment when they establish those processes, it is likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing lines. even if they select our equipment, the institutions and the customers that follow their lead could impose conditions on acceptance of that equipment, such as adherence to standards and requirements or limitations on how we license our proprietary rights that increase our costs or require us to take on greater risk. these actions could adversely impact our market share and financial results.
we depend on a limited number of key suppliers and outsource providers, and we run the risk that they might not perform as we expect outsource providers and component suppliers have played and will continue to play a key role in our manufacturing operations and in many of our transactional and administrative functions, such as information technology, facilities management, and certain elements of our finance organization. these providers and suppliers might suffer financial setbacks, be acquired by third parties, become subject to exclusivity arrangements that preclude further business with us or suffer force majeure events that could interrupt or impair their continued ability to perform as we expect.
although we attempt to select reputable providers and suppliers, and we attempt to secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts, it is possible that one or more of these providers or suppliers could fail to perform as we expect, and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business. in some cases, the requirements of our business mandate that we obtain certain components and sub-assemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. where practical, we endeavor to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any single provider or supplier will adversely affect our business, but this is not feasible in all circumstances. there is therefore a risk that a prolonged inability to obtain certain components or secure key services could impair our ability to manage operations, ship products and generate revenues, which could adversely affect our operating results and damage our customer relationships.
we face risks related to the disruption of our primary manufacturing facilities our manufacturing facilities are concentrated in just a few locations. these locations are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons such as natural disasters, terrorist attacks, disruptions of our information technology resources and utility interruptions. such disruptions may cause delays in shipping our products which could result in the loss of business or customer trust, adversely affecting our business and operating results.
once a semiconductor manufacturer commits to purchase a competitor's semiconductor manufacturing equipment, the manufacturer typically continues to purchase that competitor's equipment, making it more difficult for us to sell our equipment to that customer semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line. we believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier's processing equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time. accordingly, we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitor's equipment for the same product line application.
we face a challenging and complex competitive environment we face significant competition from multiple competitors and with the pending merger of two of our largest competitors we may face increasing competitive pressures. other companies continue to develop systems and products that are competitive to ours and may introduce new products, which may affect our ability to sell our existing products. we face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop, as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers.
we believe that to remain competitive we must devote significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to invest in product and process r&d. certain of our competitors, including those that are created and financially backed by foreign governments, have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to offer customers a more comprehensive array of products and to therefore increasingly dominate the semiconductor equipment industry. these competitors may deeply discount or give away products similar to those that we sell, challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar accommodations and threatening our ability to sell those products. we also face competition from our own customers, who in some instances have established affiliated entities that manufacture equipment similar to ours. for these reasons, we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide.
in addition, our competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. in particular, while we continue to develop product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements, we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully, or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive. accordingly, competition may intensify, and we may be unable to continue to compete successfully in our markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.
our future success depends heavily on international sales and the management of global operations non-u.s. sales accounted for approximately 86% of total revenue in fiscal 2014, 80% of total revenue in fiscal year 2013, and 83% of total revenue in fiscal year 2012. we expect that international sales will continue to account for a substantial majority of our total revenue in future years.
we are subject to various challenges related to international sales and the management of global operations including, but not limited to:
   global economic and political conditions;
   our ability to respond to customer and foreign government demands for locally sourced systems, spare parts and services and develop the necessary relationships with local suppliers;
   compliance with u.s. and international laws and regulations affecting foreign operations, including u.s. and international export restrictions and foreign labor laws;
   our ability to repatriate cash in a tax-efficient manner;
   our ability to secure and retain qualified people in all necessary locations for the successful operation of our business.
certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses from the u.s. government. our failure or inability to obtain such licenses would substantially limit our markets and severely restrict our revenues. many of the challenges noted above are applicable in china, which is a fast developing market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore an area of potential significant growth for our business. as the business volume between china and the rest of the world grows, there is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships among china, taiwan, japan, south korea, and the united states, that political and diplomatic influences might lead to trade disruptions. this would adversely affect our business with china, taiwan, japan, and/or south korea and perhaps the entire asia pacific region. a significant trade disruption in these areas could have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits.
we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates. the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in u.s. dollars. however, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to revenues denominated in japanese yen and expenses denominated in euro. currently, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short-term impact of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities; primarily third party accounts receivables, accounts payables and intercompany receivables and payables. in addition, we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows, primarily anticipated revenues denominated in japanese yen and euro-denominated expenses. we believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation. we expect to continue to enter into hedging transactions, for the purposes outlined, for the foreseeable future. however, these hedging transactions may not achieve their desired effect because differences between the actual timing of the underlying exposures and our forecasts of those exposures may leave us either over-or under-hedged on any given transaction. moreover, by hedging these foreign currency denominated revenues, expenses, monetary assets and liabilities with foreign currency forward contracts, we may miss favorable currency trends that would have been advantageous to us but for the hedges. additionally, we are exposed to short-term foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on non-u.s. dollar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities (other than those currency exposures previously discussed) and currently we do not enter into foreign currency hedge contracts against these exposures. therefore, we are subject to both favorable and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that we transact business (including intercompany transactions) for these currencies.
the magnitude of our overseas business also affects where our cash is generated. certain uses of cash, such as share repurchases or the repayment of our convertible notes, can usually only be made with cash balances and cash generated on-shore. since the majority of our cash is generated outside of the united states, this may limit certain business decisions and adversely affect business outcomes.
our ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is critical to our success our ability to compete successfully depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees. this is an ongoing challenge due to intense competition for top talent, as well as fluctuations in industry economic conditions that may require cycles of hiring activity and workforce reductions. our success in hiring depends on a variety of factors, including the attractiveness of our compensation and benefit programs and our ability to offer a challenging and rewarding work environment. we periodically evaluate our overall compensation programs and make adjustments, as appropriate, to maintain or enhance their competitiveness. if we are not able to successfully attract, retain and motivate key employees, we may be unable to capitalize on market opportunities and our operating results may be materially and adversely affected.
we rely upon certain critical information systems for the operation of our business we maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business. these information systems include telecommunications, the internet, our corporate intranet, various computer hardware and software applications, network communications, and e-mail. these information systems may be owned and maintained by us, our outsourced providers or third parties such as vendors and contractors. many of these outsourced service providers, including certain hosted software applications that we use for confidential data storage, employ "cloud computing" technology for such storage (which refers to an information technology hosting and delivery system in which data is not stored within the user's physical infrastructure but instead are delivered to and consumed by the user as an internet-based service). all of these information systems are subject to attacks, failures, and access denials from a number of potential sources including viruses, destructive or inadequate code, power failures, and physical damage to computers, hard drives, communication lines, and networking equipment. confidential and/or sensitive information stored on these information systems could be intentionally or unintentionally compromised, lost and/or stolen. while we have implemented security procedures, such as virus protection software and emergency recovery processes, to mitigate the outlined risks with respect to information systems that are under our control, they cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe and our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time, or unauthorized releases of confidential information, could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business.
our financial results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities as a global company, our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions, and significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities. our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates, in the valuation of deferred tax assets, in tax laws, by material audit assessments, or changes in or expirations of agreements with tax authorities. these factors could affect our profitability. in particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the united states, is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states. in addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability.
a failure to comply with environmental regulations may adversely affect our operating results we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the handling, discharge, and disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals. we believe that we are generally in compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained (or will obtain or are otherwise addressing the need for) all environmental permits necessary to conduct our business. these permits generally relate to the handling and disposal of hazardous wastes. nevertheless, the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, require us to suspend production, or cease operations or cause our customers to not accept our products. these regulations could require us to alter our current operations, to acquire significant additional equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations. any failure to comply with regulations governing the use, handling, sale, transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities.
if we choose to acquire or dispose of businesses, product lines and technologies, we may encounter unforeseen costs and difficulties that could impair our financial performance an important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products, augment our market coverage and distribution ability, or enhance our technological capabilities. as a result, we may make acquisitions of complementary companies, products or technologies, or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies that no longer fit our long-term strategies. managing an acquired business, disposing of product technologies or reducing personnel entail numerous operational and financial risks, including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups, diversion of management's attention away from other business concerns, amortization of acquired intangible assets, adverse customer reaction to our decision to cease support for a product, and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations. there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions, disposition of product lines or technologies, or reduction in personnel or that our management, personnel, or systems will be adequate to support continued operations. any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows.
in addition, any acquisition could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, the amortization of related intangible assets, and goodwill impairment charges, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and/or the price of our common stock.
the market for our common stock is volatile, which may affect our ability to raise capital, make acquisitions, or subject our business to additional costs the market price for our common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years. the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors, many of which are not within our control or influence. these factors include but are not limited to the following:
   general market, semiconductor, or semiconductor equipment industry conditions;
   economic or political events and trends occurring globally or in any of our key sales regions;
   variations in our quarterly operating results and financial condition, including our liquidity;
   variations in our revenues, earnings or other business and financial metrics from forecasts by us or securities analysts, or from those experienced by other companies in our industry;
   technological innovations and the introduction of new products by us or our competitors;
   disruptions of relationships with key customers or suppliers; or in addition, the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations. historically, we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our common stock due in part to the price of and markets for semiconductors. these and other factors have and may again adversely affect the price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. in the past, following volatile periods in the price of their stock, many companies became the object of securities class action litigation. if we are sued in a securities class action, we could incur substantial costs, and it could divert management's attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on our financial performance and the price for our common stock.
intellectual property, indemnity and other claims against us can be costly and we could lose significant rights that are necessary to our continued business and profitability third parties may assert infringement, unfair competition, product liability, breach of contract, or other claims against us. from time to time, other parties send us notices alleging that our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights. in addition, law enforcement authorities may seek criminal charges relating to intellectual property or other issues. we also face risks of claims arising from commercial and other relationships. in addition, our bylaws and other indemnity obligations provide that we will indemnify officers and directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to us. from time to time, in the normal course of business, we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships, including customers and suppliers, with respect to certain matters. we have agreed, under certain conditions, to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses, such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants, other third party claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such other third parties, or other claims made against certain parties. in such cases, it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms. however, we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially adversely affect our business and financial results, and we may be subject to substantial damage awards and penalties. moreover, although we have insurance to protect us from certain claims and cover certain losses to our property, such insurance may not cover us for the full amount of any losses, or at all, and may be subject to substantial exclusions and deductibles.
we may fail to protect our critical proprietary technology rights, which could affect our business our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and our ability to protect key components of that technology through patents, copyrights and trade secret protection. protecting our key proprietary technology helps us to achieve our goals of developing technological expertise and new products and systems that give us a competitive advantage; increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base; and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers. as part of our strategy to protect our technology we currently hold a number of u.s. and foreign patents and pending patent applications, and we keep certain information, processes and techniques as trade secrets. however, other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the united states or foreign governments issue to us, these governments may fail to issue patents for pending applications, or we may lose trade secret protection over valuable information due to the intentional or unintentional actions or omissions of third parties, of ours or even our own employees. additionally, intellectual property litigation can be expensive and time-consuming and even when patents are issued or trade secret processes are followed, the legal systems in certain of the countries in which we do business do not enforce patents and other intellectual property rights as rigorously as the united states. the rights granted or anticipated under any of our patents, pending patent applications or trade secrets may be narrower than we expect or, in fact, provide no competitive advantages. moreover, because we determine the jurisdictions in which to file patents at the time of filing, we may not have adequate protection in the future based on such previous decisions. any of these circumstances could have a material adverse impact on our business.
we are exposed to various risks from our regulatory environment we are subject to various risks related to (i) new, different, inconsistent or even conflicting laws, rules and regulations that may be enacted by legislative bodies and/or regulatory agencies in the countries that we operate; (ii) disagreements or disputes between national or regional regulatory agencies related to international trade; and (iii) the interpretation and application of laws, rules and regulations. as a public company with global operations, we are subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, including those related to financial and other disclosures, corporate governance, privacy, anti-corruption, such as the foreign corrupt practices act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and antitrust regulations, among others. one of these laws imposes new disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals, which may have originated from the democratic republic of the congo and adjoining countries in our products. this new requirement could affect the pricing, sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of components we use in our products. in addition, there will be additional costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of any of the covered minerals used in our products. our supply chain is complex, and we may be unable to verify the origins for all metals used in our products. financial reform legislation and the regulations enacted under such legislation have also added costs to our business by, among other things, requiring advisory votes on executive compensation and on severance packages upon a change in control.
to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with all evolving standards. changes in or ambiguous interpretations of laws, regulations and standards may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters. efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management's time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities. if we are found by a court or regulatory agency not to be in compliance with the laws and regulations, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
our board of directors announced its plans to declare a quarterly dividend on april 29, 2014, with the first dividend payment paid on july 2, 2014. in addition, on april 29, 2014, we announced that our board of directors has authorized the company to repurchase up to $850 million of common stock, which includes the remaining value available under the prior authorization of $250 million. our intent to continue to pay quarterly dividends and to repurchase our shares is subject to capital availability and, in the case of dividends, periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends by us. future dividends and share repurchases may also be affected by, among other factors: our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our research and development; legal risks; stock repurchase programs; changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws; and changes to our business model. our dividend payments and share repurchases may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or repurchase shares at all or in any particular amounts. a reduction or suspension in our dividend payments or share repurchase activity could have a negative effect on our stock price.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect. our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in "risk factors" and elsewhere in this 2014 form 10-k and other documents we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission. (see "cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements" in part i of this 2014 form 10-k).

executive summary lam research has been an innovative supplier of wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry for more than 30 years. our customers include semiconductor manufacturers that make memory, microprocessors, and other logic integrated circuits for a wide range of electronics; including cell phones, computers, storage devices and networking equipment.
our market-leading products are designed to help our customers build the smaller, faster and more power-efficient devices that are necessary to power the capabilities required by end users. the process of integrated circuits fabrication consists of a complex series of process and preparation steps and lam's product offerings in deposition, etch and clean address a number of the most critical steps in the fabrication process. we leverage our expertise in semiconductor processing to develop technology and productivity solutions that typically benefit our customers through lower defect rates, enhanced yields, faster processing time, and reduced cost as well as by facilitating their ability to meet more stringent performance and design standards.
the semiconductor capital equipment industry has been highly competitive and subject to business cycles that historically have been characterized by rapid changes in demand. more recently with consolidation in the customer base, the cyclical behavior appears to have diminished somewhat. with a reduced number of customers, variability in their business plans may lead to changes in demand for lam's equipment and services over certain periods. the variability in our customers' investments during any particular period is dependent on several factors including but not limited to electronics demand, economic conditions (both general and in the semiconductor and electronics industries), industry supply and demand, prices for semiconductors, and our customers' ability to develop and manufacture increasingly complex and costly semiconductor devices.
demand for our products increased steadily throughout fiscal year 2014 as semiconductor device manufacturers made capacity and technology investments. technology inflections have been in industry inflection points that include finfet transistors, 3-d nand and multiple patterning. these technology inflections have led to an increase in the deposition, etch and clean market size. this increase, as well as market share gains in these inflections, have contributed to the increased revenue in fiscal 2014. we believe that, over the longer term, demand for our products should increase as the proportion of customers' capital expenditures rise in these technology inflection areas, and we continue to gain market share.
on june 4, 2012, we completed our acquisition of novellus systems, inc ("novellus"). results for fiscal years 2014 and 2013 include novellus operations. results for fiscal year 2012 include novellus operations from the acquisition date through june 24, 2012. lam's primary reasons for this acquisition were to complement existing product offerings and to provide opportunities for revenue growth and cost synergies.
fiscal year 2014 revenues increased 28% compared to fiscal year 2013, reflecting the increase in technology inflections' spending, as well as, incremental market share gains. the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was due primarily to a decrease in novellus acquisition-related inventory fair value adjustments, improved business volumes and product mix. operating expenses in fiscal year 2014 increased as compared to fiscal year 2013 primarily related to continued investments in the next-generation research and development and customer facing activities.
our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and investments balances totaled approximately $3.2 billion as of june 29, 2014 compared to $2.7 billion as of june 30, 2013. this increase was primarily the result of $717 million of cash flows from operating activities, offset by $245 million in share repurchases. this compares to $720 million in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2013.
united states                      15   %                20   %                17   %
shipments for fiscal year 2014 were approximately $4.6 billion and increased by 23% compared to fiscal year 2013. shipments for fiscal year 2013 were approximately $3.7 billion and increased by 39% compared to fiscal year 2012. the increase in shipments during fiscal year 2014 as compared to fiscal year 2013 related to continued strengthening of customer demand through fiscal year 2014. the increase in shipments during fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2012 related to having a full year of combined operations with novellus and the strengthening of customer demand in the second half of fiscal year 2013.
during fiscal year 2014, memory customer demand was higher due to node transitions in memory manufacturing, stable pricing for memory, and tight industry supply.
unshipped orders in backlog as of june 29, 2014 were approximately $866 million and increased from approximately $764 million as of june 30, 2013. our unshipped orders backlog includes orders for systems, spares, and services. please refer to "backlog" in part i item 1, "business" of this report for a description of our policies for adding to and adjusting backlog.
united states                    13   %                20   %                17   %
the revenue increase in fiscal year 2014 as compared to fiscal year 2013 reflected increased customer and industry demand. the revenue increase in fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2012 reflected a full fiscal year of operations post-acquisition of novellus. our revenue levels are generally correlated to the amount of shipments and our installation and acceptance timelines. the overall asia region continues to account for a majority of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity additions for semiconductor manufacturing continues to occur in this region. our deferred revenue balance was $361.6 million as of june 29, 2014 compared to $389.2 million as of june 30, 2013. our deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to japanese customers, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. shipments to japanese customers are classified as inventory at cost until the time of customer acceptance. the anticipated future revenue value from shipments to japanese customers was approximately $34 million as of june 29, 2014 compared to $70 million as of june 30, 2013.
the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was due to higher business volumes as well as a more favorable product mix. additionally, the novellus acquisition related inventory fair value impact and cost associated with rationalization of certain product configurations decreased by $78 million and $15 million, respectively, in fiscal year 2014 as compared to fiscal year 2013.
the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012 was due primarily to higher novellus acquisition-related inventory fair value adjustments of approximately $77 million, amortization of acquired intangible assets of approximately $78 million, and $16 million of costs associated with rationalization of certain product configurations. offsetting these higher novellus acquisition and product configuration-related expenses was a favorable change in gross margin as a result of increased business volume.
we continued to make significant r&d investments focused on leading-edge deposition, plasma etch, single-wafer clean and other semiconductor manufacturing requirements. the increase in r&d expense during fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to a $41 million increase in salaries and benefits related to higher headcount and higher incentive and equity compensation offset by a reduction of $7 million in supplies.
the increase in r&d spending during fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012 reflects a full year of combined operations with novellus. increased r&d expense included $111 million in salary and benefits mainly due to higher headcount, $46 million in supplies, $26 million in depreciation and amortization due to new product development, $15 million in outside services, and an additional $12 million in rent, utilities and repairs.
the increase in sg&a expense during fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was due primarily to a net increase of $11 million in salaries, benefits and incentive compensation, $20 million increase in marketing expenses and outside services, $7 million in costs associated with rationalization of certain product configurations, $8 million of impairment of a long lived asset, and a $5 million cost related to the renewal of our fremont and livermore buildings' operating leases. this increase was offset by a $34 million reduction in integration costs and a $10 million reduction in amortization of intangible assets related to the novellus integration.
the increase in sg&a expense during fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012 was due primarily to the impact of combined operations with novellus. increased expense includes $108 million in salary and benefits due to a higher headcount, $73 million of intangible asset amortization, $29 million in integration cost, and $14 million in rent/repair/utilities, all offset by a $47 million decrease in novellus acquisition-related cost.
the increase in interest expense during fiscal year 2013 as compared with fiscal year 2012 was primarily due to the 2041 convertible notes assumed in june 2012 in connection with the novellus acquisition.
other income realized during fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to a gain on the disposition of a private equity investment. other expenses during fiscal year 2013 included a $4 million other-than-temporary impairment of a public equity investment recognized during the march 2013 quarter. other expenses during fiscal year 2012 included a $2 million other-than temporary impairment of a private equity investment recognized during the september 2011 quarter.
income tax expense (benefit)
the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2014 as compared to fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to the change in the level of income and geographic mix of income between higher and lower tax jurisdictions, u.s. income and applicable foreign withholding taxes on undistributed foreign earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries for 2014, reduced tax benefit in fiscal year 2014 due to the expiration of the federal research and development tax credit as of december 31, 2013, and tax benefits in fiscal year 2013 related to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to the lapse of the statute of limitations and successful resolution of certain tax matters. the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2012 was primarily due to the level of income, tax benefits related to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to the lapse of the statute of limitations and successful resolution of certain tax matters, the change in geographical mix of income between higher and lower tax jurisdictions, and tax benefit due to the retroactive reinstatement of the federal research and development tax credit in january 2013.
international revenues account for a significant portion of our total revenues, such that a material portion of our pre-tax income is earned and taxed outside the united states at rates that are generally lower than in the united states. please refer to note 15 to consolidated financial statements.
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. our gross deferred tax assets, composed primarily of reserves and accruals that are not currently deductible and tax credit carryforwards, were $343 million and $318 million at the end of fiscal years 2014 and 2013, respectively. these gross deferred tax assets were offset by deferred tax liabilities of $294 million and $259 million at the end of fiscal years 2014 and 2013, respectively, and a valuation allowance of $74 million and $77 million at the end of fiscal years 2014 and 2013, respectively. the change in the gross deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities between fiscal year 2014 and 2013 is primarily due to accrual for future tax liability due to the expected repatriation of foreign earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries for 2014 and amortization of convertible debt, offset by increase in deferred tax assets related to accounting allowances and reserves.
at our fiscal year end of june 29, 2014 we continue to record a valuation allowance to offset the entire california deferred tax asset balance due to the impact of the single sales factor apportionment election resulting in lower taxable income in california. we also continue to record valuation allowance on certain foreign entities' net operating losses.
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to assess the need for changes in valuation allowances, if any.
uncertain tax positions we reevaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. this evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") requires management to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. we based our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believed to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions. actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.
the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in note 2 of our consolidated financial statements. some of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies. a critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, complex and/or subjective judgments, often regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.
we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
recognition: we recognize all revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title has passed or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable, collection of the receivable is reasonably assured, and we have received customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations. if terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period, we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance, whichever occurs first. if the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance or the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision, we recognize revenue when it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreed-to customer specifications. in situations with multiple deliverables, we recognize revenue upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations. we allocate revenue from multiple-element arrangements among the separate elements based on their relative selling prices, provided the elements have value on a stand-alone basis. our sales arrangements do not include a general right of return. the maximum revenue we recognize on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items. we generally recognize revenue related to sales of spare parts and system upgrade kits upon shipment. we generally recognize revenue related to services upon completion of the services requested by a customer order. we recognize revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. when goods or services have been delivered to the customer but all conditions for revenue recognition have not been met, we record deferred revenue and/or deferred costs of sales in deferred profit on our consolidated balance sheet.
inventory valuation: inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard costs that approximate actual costs on a first-in, first-out basis. we maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity on-hand and standard cost for each product, including purchased components, subassemblies, and finished goods. we maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand. finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer. unless specified in the terms of sale, title generally transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier. transfer of title for shipments to japanese customers generally occurs at the time of customer acceptance.
management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly. our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods, and spare parts in each reporting period. obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management's estimated usage requirement is written down to its estimated market value if less than cost. estimates of market value include, but are not limited to, management's forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and/or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, and possible alternative uses. if future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period in which we make the revision.
warranty: typically, the sale of semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and service warranties to customers as part of the overall price of the system. we provide standard warranties for our systems. we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system when we recognize revenue. we do not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific systems. the amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity that uses factors such as type of system, customer, geographic region, and any known factors such as tool reliability trends. all actual or estimated parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves on a system-by-system basis.
while we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. in addition to the provision of standard warranties, we offer customer-paid extended warranty services. revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. related costs are recorded as incurred.
equity-based compensation  employee stock purchase plan ("espp") and employee stock plans: gaap requires us to recognize the fair value of equity-based compensation in net income. we determine the fair value of our restricted stock units ("rsus"), excluding market-based performance rsus, based on the fair market value of company stock at the date of grant. we estimate the fair value of our market-based performance rsus using a monte carlo simulation model at the date of the grant. we estimate the fair value of our stock options and espp awards using the black-scholes option valuation model. this model requires us to input highly subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award. we amortize the fair value of equity-based awards over the vesting periods of the awards, and we have elected to use the straight-line method of amortization.
we make quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our tax credit pool related to equity-based compensation to determine if there are any deficiencies that we are required to recognize in our consolidated statements of operations. we will only recognize a benefit from stock-based compensation in paid-in-capital if we realize an incremental tax benefit after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized. in addition, we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stock-based compensation on the research tax credit through the income statement (continuing operations) rather than through paid-in-capital. we have also elected to net deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for the accumulated stock award tax benefits for income tax footnote disclosure purposes. we will track these stock award attributes separately and will only recognize these attributes through paid-in-capital.
income taxes: deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. we believe it is more-likely-than-not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at the time. in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. likewise, if we later determine that it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets would be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed.
we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. please refer to note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
in addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. this evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period such determination is made.
goodwill and intangible assets: the valuation of intangible assets acquired in a business combination requires the use of management estimates including but not limited to estimating future expected cash flows from assets acquired and determining discount rates. management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available.
goodwill represents the amount by which the purchase price in each business combination exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. each component of the company for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the results of operations is considered a reporting unit. all goodwill acquired in a business combination is assigned to one or more reporting units as of the acquisition date. goodwill is assigned to the company's reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. the goodwill assigned to a reporting unit is the difference between the acquisition consideration assigned to the reporting unit on a relative fair value basis and the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities that can be specifically attributed to the reporting unit. we test goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually. we amortize intangible assets with estimable useful lives over their respective estimated useful lives, and we review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value.
we review goodwill at least annually for impairment. if certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests, we would perform an impairment test at that date. in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, we: (1) allocate goodwill to our reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates; (2) estimate the fair value of our reporting units; and (3) determine the carrying value (book value) of those reporting units, as some of the assets and liabilities related to those reporting units are not held by those reporting units but by a corporate function. prior to this allocation of the assets to the reporting units, we assess long-lived assets for impairment. furthermore, if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we must estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of that reporting unit, in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business. this can require independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as in-process r&d and developed technology. only after this process is completed can the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, be determined. in our goodwill impairment analysis we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative analysis. we do not calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis, which was performed as of the first day of our fourth quarter, march 31, 2014, did not result in a goodwill impairment charge, nor did we record any goodwill impairment in fiscal 2013 or 2012. as a result of historical performance and growth potential, our single-wafer clean systems reporting unit may be at greater risk for goodwill impairment than our other reporting units if our actual results for this reporting unit differ from our projections.
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis. we determine the fair value of our reporting units by using a weighted combination of both a market and an income approach, as this combination is deemed to be the most indicative of fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants.
under the market approach, we use information regarding the reporting unit as well as publicly available industry information to determine various financial multiples to value our reporting units. under the income approach, we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn.
in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit for the purposes of our annual or periodic analyses, we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of our reporting units, including estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment. although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit. in addition, we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units. we also consider our market capitalization and that of our competitors on the date we perform the analysis. changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge.
as a result, several factors could result in impairment of a material amount of our goodwill balance in future periods, including, but not limited to: (1) weakening of the global economy, weakness in the semiconductor equipment industry, or our failure to reach our internal forecasts, which could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted levels of cash flows and reduce the estimated discounted cash flow value of our reporting units; and (2) a decline in our stock price and resulting market capitalization, if we determine that the decline is sustained and indicates a reduction in the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. in addition, the value we assign to intangible assets, other than goodwill, is based on our estimates and judgments regarding expectations such as the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. if actual product acceptance differs significantly from our estimates, we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value.
recent accounting pronouncements in july 2013, the fasb released accounting standards update 2013-11 "presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists." the new standard requires that an unrecognized tax benefit should be presented as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward or other tax credit carryforward when settlement in this manner is available under the tax law. we are required to adopt this standard starting in fiscal year 2015 and are currently in the process of determining the impact, if any, on our financial position.
in april 2014, the fasb released accounting standards update 2014-8 "presentation of financial statements and property, plant and equipment: reporting discontinued operations and disclosure of disposals of components of an entity." the new standard re-defines discontinued operations and requires only those disposals of components of an entity, including classifications as held for sale, that represent a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results to be reported as discontinued operations. in addition, the new standard expands the disclosure requirements of discontinued operations. we are required to adopt this standard starting in fiscal year 2015 and are currently in the process of determining the impact, if any, on our financial position.
in may 2014, the fasb released accounting standards update 2014-9 "revenue from contracts with customers" to supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under gaap. the core principle of the standard is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. the new standard defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than required under existing gaap including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. we are required to adopt this standard starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 using either of two methods: (i) retrospective to each prior reporting period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients as defined within the standard; or (ii) retrospective with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain additional disclosures as defined per the standard. we are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of this standard on our financial position.
liquidity and capital resources total gross cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and investments balances were $3.2 billion at the end of fiscal year 2014 compared to $2.7 billion at the end of fiscal year 2013. this increase was primarily the result of $717 million of cash flow from operating activities. approximately $2.2 billion and $2.0 billion of our total cash and investments as of june 29, 2014 and june 30, 2013, respectively, were held outside the u.s. in our foreign subsidiaries, the majority of which would be subject to tax at u.s. rates if it were to be repatriated. refer to note 15 of our consolidated financial statements, included in item 15 of this report, for information concerning the potential tax impact of repatriating earnings for certain non-u.s. subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested outside the u.s.
cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities of $717 million during fiscal year 2014 consisted of (in millions):
equity-based compensation                                 104
changes in operating asset and liability accounts        (293   )
significant changes in operating asset and liability accounts, net of foreign exchange impact, included the following uses of cash: increases in accounts receivable of $201.5 million, inventories of $190.1 million, and prepaid expenses and other assets of $9.5 million, partially offset by the following sources of cash: increases in accounts payable of $18.7 million, deferred profit of $10.9 million and accrued liabilities of $78.6 million.
cash flows from investing activities net cash used for investing activities during fiscal year 2014 was $265.2 million, which was primarily due to net purchases of available-for-sale securities of $284.0 million, and capital expenditures of $145.5 million, partially offset by cash proceeds on the sale of assets of $156.7 million.
cash flows from financing activities net cash used for financing activities during fiscal year 2014 was $162.7 million, which was primarily due to $244.9 million in treasury stock repurchases, partially offset by net proceeds from issuance of common stock related to employee equity-based plans of $77.7 million.
liquidity given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry, we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in r&d and capital infrastructure. based upon our current business outlook, we expect that our levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at june 29, 2014 will be sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations, investments, debt service requirements, and capital expenditures, through at least the next 12 months.
in the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products and services. while we have substantial cash balances in the united states and offshore, we may require additional funding and need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. we believe that, if necessary, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. however, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us.
off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we have certain obligations to make future payments under various contracts, some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some of which are not. obligations that are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with gaap include our long-term debt which is outlined in the following table. our off-balance sheet arrangements are presented as operating leases and purchase obligations in the table. our contractual obligations and commitments as of june 29, 2014, relating to these agreements and our guarantees are included in the following table. the amounts in the table below exclude $258 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax benefits as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or time of settlement. see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

*                                            as noted above, the conversion period for the 2041 notes opened as of june 30, 2013 and remains open as of june 29, 2014. as such, the net carrying value of the 2041 notes is included within current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. the $700 million principal balance of the 2041 notes has been included in the more than 5 years payment period in the table above, which reflects the contractual maturity assuming no conversion. see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements, included in item 15 of this report, for additional information concerning the 2041 notes and associated conversion feature.
operating leases we lease most of our administrative, r&d and manufacturing facilities, regional sales/service offices and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. certain of our facility leases for buildings located at our fremont, california headquarters, livermore facilities, and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods or to purchase the facilities. certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation. in addition to amounts included in the table above, we have guaranteed residual values for certain of our fremont and livermore facility leases of up to $191 million. see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.
capital leases capital leases reflect building and office equipment lease obligations. the amounts in the table above include the interest portion of payment obligations.
purchase obligations purchase obligations consist of significant contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multi-year periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments, including vendor-consigned inventories. the contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at june 29, 2014 under these arrangements and others. for obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee. actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided.
long-term debt on may 11, 2011, we issued and sold $450.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 0.5% convertible notes due 2016 (the "2016 notes") and $450.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.25% convertible notes due 2018 (the "2018 notes," and collectively with the "2016 notes", the "notes"). the 2016 notes were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of 0.5% per annum and the 2018 notes were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of 1.25% per annum. the notes may be converted into our common stock, under certain circumstances, based on a conversion rate of 15.9128 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which is equal to a conversion price of approximately $62.84 per share of our common stock. the conversion price will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest. concurrently with the issuance of the notes, we purchased convertible note hedges for $181.1 million and sold warrants for $133.8 million. the separate convertible note hedges and warrant transactions are structured to reduce the potential future economic dilution associated with the conversion of the notes.
in june 2012, with the acquisition of novellus, we assumed $700 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.625% convertible senior notes due may 2041 (the "2041 notes"). the 2041 notes were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of 2.625% per annum. the 2041 notes may be converted, under certain circumstances, into our common stock based on a conversion rate of 28.5572 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which represents a conversion price of approximately $35.02 per share of common stock.
during fiscal year 2014, 2013, and 2012 we made $1.7 million, $2.2 million, and $5.3 million, respectively, in principal payments on long-term debt and capital leases, respectively.
revolving credit arrangements on march 12, 2014, we entered into a $300 million revolving unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of lenders that matures on march 12, 2019. the facility includes an option for us to, subject to certain requirements, request an increase in the facility of up to an additional $200 million, for a potential total commitment of $500 million. proceeds from the credit facility can be used for general corporate purposes. interest on amounts borrowed under the credit facility is, at our option, based on (i) a base rate, defined as the greatest of (a) prime rate, (b) federal funds rate plus 0.5%, or (c) one-month libor plus 1.0%, plus a spread of 0.0% to 0.5% or (ii) libor plus a spread of 0.9% to 1.5%, in each case the applicable spread is determined based on the rating of our non-credit enhanced, senior unsecured long-term debt. principal, and any accrued and unpaid interest, is due and payable upon maturity. additionally, we will pay the lenders a quarterly commitment fee that varies based on our rating described above. the credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants including maintaining a consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio of no more than 0.5 to 1.0 and maintaining unrestricted or unencumbered cash and investments, of no less than $1.0 billion. as of june 29, 2014, we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and were in compliance with all financial covenants.
other guarantees we have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors for taxes and general liability under some of our agreements. we have entered into certain insurance contracts that may limit our exposure to such indemnifications. as of june 29, 2014, we had not recorded any liability on our consolidated financial statements in connection with these indemnifications, as we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that we will pay any amounts under these guarantees.
generally, we indemnify, under pre-determined conditions and limitations, our customers for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights by our products or services. we seek to limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales price of the products or services subject to its indemnification obligations. we do not believe, based on information available, that it is probable that we will pay any material amounts under these guarantees.
we provide guarantees and standby letters of credit to certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated during the ordinary course of business. as of june 29, 2014, the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these arrangements and letters of credit was $20.6 million. we do not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid.

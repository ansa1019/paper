item 1a.risk factors our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described below, which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results, and affect the trading price of our class a and class c stock.
risks specific to our company we generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising. reduced spending by advertisers, a loss of partners, or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to customize ads could harm our business.
we generated more than 80% of total revenues from online advertising in 2022. many of our advertisers, companies that distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their contracts with us at any time. these partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value alphabet inc.
(such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more effective monetization) than their available alternatives. changes to our advertising policies and data privacy practices, as well as changes to other companies' advertising and/or data privacy practices have in the past, and may in the future, affect the advertising that we are able to provide. in addition, technologies have been developed that make customized ads more difficult or that block the display of ads altogether, and some providers of online services have integrated these technologies that could potentially impair the availability and functionality of third-party digital advertising. failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively and competitively could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.
in addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions. adverse macroeconomic conditions have affected, and may in the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting in fluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.
we face intense competition. if we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users, customers, and other partners, we may not remain competitive, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.
our business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. our businesses face changing technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of rival products and services. to compete successfully, we must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant and useful products, services, and technologies in a timely manner. as our businesses evolve, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products and services. we must continue to invest significant resources in r&d, including through acquisitions, in order to enhance our technology and new and existing products and services.
we have many competitors in different industries. our current and potential domestic and international competitors range from large and established companies to emerging start-ups. some competitors have longer operating histories and well established relationships in various sectors. they can use their experience and resources in ways that could affect our competitive position, including by making acquisitions, continuing to invest heavily in r&d and in talent, initiating intellectual property and competition claims (whether or not meritorious), and continuing to compete for users, advertisers, customers, and content providers. further, discrepancies in enforcement of existing laws may enable our lesser known competitors to aggressively interpret those laws without commensurate scrutiny, thereby affording them competitive advantages. our competitors may also be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can or may foresee the need for products and services before us.
our financial condition and operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive to the evolving needs and desires of our users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. as new and existing technologies continue to develop, competitors and new entrants may be able to offer experiences that are, or that are seen to be, substantially similar to or better than ours. these technologies could reduce usage of our products and services, and force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources to develop and operate equal or better products and services. competitors' success in providing compelling products and services or in attracting and retaining users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers could harm our financial condition and operating results.
our ongoing investment in new businesses, products, services, and technologies is inherently risky, and could divert management attention and harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.
we have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services, and technologies. the investments that we are making across our businesses, such as in ai, reflect our ongoing efforts to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. our investments span a wide range of industries beyond online advertising. such investments ultimately may not be commercially viable or may not result in an adequate return of capital and, in pursuing new strategies, we may incur unanticipated liabilities. these endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including diversion of resources and management attention from current operations and the use of alternative investment, governance, or compensation structures that may fail to adequately align incentives across the company or otherwise accomplish their objectives.
within google services, we continue to invest heavily in hardware, including our smartphones, home devices, and wearables, which is a highly competitive market with frequent introduction of new products and services, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in performance characteristics, and price and feature sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. there can be no assurance we will be able to provide hardware that competes effectively.
within google cloud, we devote significant resources to develop and deploy our enterprise-ready cloud services, including google cloud platform and google workspace. we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services, invest in cybersecurity, and hire talent, particularly to support and scale our sales force. at the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services. pricing and delivery models are competitive and constantly evolving, and we may not attain sufficient scale and profitability to achieve our business objectives. further, our business with public sector customers may present additional risks, including regulatory compliance risks. for instance, we may be subject to government audits and cost reviews, and any failure to comply or any deficiencies found may expose us to legal, financial, and/or reputational risks. evolving laws and regulations may require us to make new capital investments, build new products, and seek partners to deliver localized services in other countries, and we may not be able to meet sovereign operating requirements.
within other bets, we are investing significantly in the areas of health, life sciences, and transportation, among others. these investment areas face intense competition from large, experienced, and well-funded competitors, and our offerings, many of which involve the development of new and emerging technologies, may not be successful, or be able to compete effectively or operate at sufficient levels of profitability.
in addition, new and evolving products and services, including those that use ai, require significant investment and raise ethical, technological, legal, regulatory, and other challenges, which may negatively affect our brands and demand for our products and services. because all of these investment areas are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful or will not harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.
our revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including changes in the devices and modalities used to access our products and services; changes in geographic mix; deceleration or declines in advertiser spending; competition; customer usage and demand for our products; decreases in our pricing of our products and services; ongoing product and policy changes; and shifts to lower priced products and services.
in addition, we may also experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting from a variety of factors, such as the continued expansion of our business into new fields, including products and services such as hardware, google cloud, and subscription products, as well as significant investments in other bets, all of which may have margins lower than those we generate from advertising. in particular, margins on our hardware products have had, and may continue to have, an adverse affect on our consolidated margins due to pressures on pricing and higher cost of sales. we may also experience downward pressure on our operating margins from increasing regulations, increasing competition, and increasing costs for many aspects of our business. further, certain of our costs and expenses are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. additionally, in conjunction with our efforts to re-engineer costs, we may not be able to execute these efforts in a timely manner or these efforts may not be successful. due to these factors and the evolving nature of our business, our historical revenue growth rate and historical operating margin may not be indicative of our future performance. for additional information, see trends in our business and financial effect and revenues and monetization metrics in part ii, item 7 of this annual report on form 10-k.
our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services, and brands as well as affect our ability to compete.
our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, services, and technologies. for example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed or made available through the internet. also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. moreover, we may not have adequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. there is always the possibility that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable.
we also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. the secrecy of such trade secrets and other sensitive information could be compromised, which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets. we also face risks associated with our trademarks. for example, there is a risk that the word "google" could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word "search." some courts have ruled that "google" is a protectable trademark, but it is possible that other courts, particularly those outside of the u.s., alphabet inc.
may reach a different determination. if this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in other people using the word "google" to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our brand.
any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete. also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our financial condition and operating results.
our business depends on strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our ability to expand our base of users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners.
our strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. maintaining and enhancing the brands within google services, google cloud, and other bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch new and innovative products and services that better serve the needs of our users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners. our brands have been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by a number of factors, including, among others, reputational issues, third-party content shared on our platforms, data privacy and security issues and developments, and product or technical performance failures. for example, if we fail to respond appropriately to the sharing of misinformation or objectionable content on our services and/or products or objectionable practices by advertisers, or otherwise to adequately address user concerns, our users may lose confidence in our brands.
furthermore, failure to maintain and enhance our brands could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. our success will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality, trustworthy, innovative products and services that are truly useful and play a valuable role in a range of settings.
we face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.
we face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management, which could affect our ability to supply both our products and our services.
we rely on contract manufacturers to manufacture or assemble our hardware products and servers and networking equipment used in our technical infrastructure, and we may supply the contract manufacturers with components to assemble the hardware products and equipment. we also rely on other companies to participate in the distribution of our products and services. our business could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage these companies with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage fail to meet their obligations (whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons), or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of our arrangements with them.
we have experienced and/or may in the future experience supply shortages, price increases, and/or longer lead times that could negatively affect our operations, driven by raw material, component availability, manufacturing capacity, labor shortages, industry allocations, logistics capacity, inflation, foreign currency exchange rates, tariffs, sanctions and export controls, trade disputes and barriers, geopolitical tensions, armed conflicts, natural disasters or pandemics, the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention, and increased storm severity), power loss, and significant changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers. in addition, some of the components we use in our technical infrastructure and our hardware products are available from only one or limited sources, and we may not be able to find replacement vendors on favorable terms in the event of a supply chain disruption. a significant supply interruption that affects us or our vendors could delay critical data center upgrades or expansions and delay consumer product availability.
we may enter into long-term contracts for materials and products that commit us to significant terms and conditions. we may face costs for materials and products that are not consumed due to market demand, technological change, changed consumer preferences, quality, product recalls, and warranty issues. for instance, because certain of our hardware supply contracts have volume-based pricing or minimum purchase requirements, if the volume of our hardware sales decreases or does not reach projected targets, we could face increased materials and manufacturing costs or other financial liabilities that could make our products more costly per unit to manufacture and harm our financial condition and operating results. furthermore, certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable contractual terms based on volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and may affect our supply.
our products and services have had, and in the future may have, quality issues resulting from design, manufacturing, or operations. sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other alphabet inc.
manufacturers or suppliers. if the quality of our products and services does not meet expectations or our products or services are defective, it could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.
we require our suppliers and business partners to comply with laws and, where applicable, our company policies and practices, such as the google supplier code of conduct, regarding workplace and employment practices, data security, environmental compliance, and intellectual property licensing, but we do not control them or their practices. violations of law or unethical business practices could result in supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, harm to key relationships, and damage to our reputation. their failure to procure necessary license rights to intellectual property could affect our ability to sell our products or services and expose us to litigation or financial claims.
interruption to, interference with, or failure of our complex information technology and communications systems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services, which could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.
the availability of our products and services and fulfillment of our customer contracts depend on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems. our systems are vulnerable to damage, interference, or interruption from modifications or upgrades, terrorist attacks, state-sponsored attacks, natural disasters or pandemics, geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts, the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention, and increased storm severity), power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, software bugs, ransomware attacks, computer denial of service attacks, phishing schemes, or other attempts to harm or access our systems. some of our data centers are located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes or other natural disasters. our data centers are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism, and, in some cases, to potential disruptions resulting from problems experienced by facility operators or disruptions as a result of geopolitical tensions and conflicts happening in the area. some of our systems are not fully redundant, and disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. the occurrence of a natural disaster or pandemic, closure of a facility, or other unanticipated problems affecting our data centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. in addition, our products and services are highly technical and complex and have contained in the past, and may contain in the future, errors or vulnerabilities, which could result in interruptions in or failure of our services or systems. any of these incidents could impede or prevent us from effectively offering products and providing services, which could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.
our international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.
our international operations are significant to our revenues and net income, and we plan to continue to grow internationally. international revenues accounted for approximately 51% of our consolidated revenues in 2022. in addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international operations expose us to other risks, including the following:
•restrictions on foreign ownership and investments, and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the u.s.;
•import and export requirements, tariffs, and other market access barriers that may prevent or impede us from offering products or providing services to a particular market, or that could limit our ability to source assemblies and finished products from a particular market, and may increase our operating costs;
•longer payment cycles in some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels of payment fraud;
•an evolving foreign policy landscape that may adversely affect our revenues and could subject us to new regulatory costs and challenges (including new customer requirements), in addition to other adverse effects that we are unable to effectively anticipate;
•sanctions, export controls, and trade restrictions that limit our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions or to comply with local laws, including as a result of geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts, such as the ongoing conflict in ukraine;
•political unrest, conflict, and changes in governmental regimes that may adversely affect demand and usage of our products and services, may limit the ability for people in certain areas to access and use our products and services, or may impede us from offering products or providing services to a particular market;
•anti-corruption laws, such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, and other local laws prohibiting certain payments to government officials, violations of which could result in civil and criminal penalties;
•uncertainty regarding regulatory outcomes and other liabilities, including uncertainty as a result of local laws, insufficient due process, and lack of legal precedent; and
•different employee/employer relationships, existence of works councils and labor unions, and other challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences, making it harder to do business in certain jurisdictions.
because we conduct business in currencies other than u.s. dollars but report our financial results in u.s. dollars, we have faced, and will continue to face, exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenues and earnings. hedging programs are also inherently risky and could expose us to additional risks that could harm our financial condition and operating results.
we are exposed to fluctuations in the fair values of our investments and, in some instances, our financial statements incorporate valuation methodologies that are subjective in nature resulting in fluctuations over time.
the fair value of our investments may in the future be, and certain investments have been in the past, negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, performance and financial results of the underlying entities, foreign exchange rates, changes in interest rates, including changes that may result from the implementation of new benchmark rates, the effect of new or changing regulations, the stock market in general, or other factors.
we measure certain of our non-marketable equity and debt securities, certain other instruments including stock-based compensation awards settled in the stock of certain other bets, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. the determination of fair value involves use of appropriate valuation methods and certain unobservable inputs, requires management judgment and estimation, and may change over time. we adjust the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities to fair value for observable transactions of identical or similar investments of the same issuer or for impairments. all gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities, are recognized in other income (expense), which increases the volatility of our other income (expense). the unrealized gains and losses we record from fair value remeasurements of our non-marketable equity securities in any particular period may differ significantly from the gains or losses we ultimately realize on such investments.
as a result of these factors, the value of our investments could decline, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.
risks related to our industry people access the internet through a variety of platforms and devices that continue to evolve with the advancement of technology and user preferences. if manufacturers and users do not widely adopt versions of our products and services developed for these interfaces, our business could be harmed.
people access the internet through a growing variety of devices such as desktop computers, mobile phones, smartphones, laptops and tablets, video game consoles, voice-activated speakers, wearables, automobiles, and television-streaming devices. our products and services may be less popular on some interfaces. each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices, and our products and services may not be available or may only be available with limited functionality for our users or our advertisers on these devices as a result. some manufacturers may also elect not to include our products on their devices. in addition, search queries may be undertaken via voice-activated search, apps, social media or other platforms, which could harm our business. it is hard to predict the challenges we may encounter in adapting our products and services and developing competitive new products and services. we expect to continue to devote significant resources to creating and supporting products and services across multiple platforms and devices. failing to attract and retain a substantial number of new device manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, developers, and users, or failing to develop products and technologies that work well on new devices and platforms, could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results and ability to capture future business opportunities.
data privacy and security concerns relating to our technology and our practices could harm our reputation, cause us to incur significant liability, and deter current and potential users or customers from using our products and services. computer viruses, software bugs or defects, security breaches, and attacks on our systems could result in the improper disclosure and use of user data and interference with our users' and customers' ability to use our products and services, harming our business and reputation.
concerns about, including the adequacy of, our practices with regard to the collection, use, governance, disclosure, or security of personal data or other data-privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. our policies and practices may change over time as expectations and regulations regarding privacy and data change.
our products and services involve the storage, handling, and transmission of proprietary and other sensitive information. software bugs, theft, misuse, defects, vulnerabilities in our products and services, and security breaches expose us to a risk of loss or improper use and disclosure of such information, which could result in litigation and other potential liabilities, including regulatory fines and penalties, as well as reputational harm. additionally, our products incorporate highly technical and complex technologies, and thus our technologies and software have contained, and are likely in the future to contain, undetected errors, bugs, and/or vulnerabilities. we have in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, some errors in our software code only after we have released the code. systems and control failures, security breaches, failure to comply with our privacy policies, and/or inadvertent disclosure of user data could result in government and legal exposure, seriously harm our reputation, brand, and business, and impair our ability to attract and retain users or customers. such incidents have occurred in the past and may continue to occur due to the scale and nature of our products and services. while there is no guarantee that such incidents will not cause significant damage, we expect to continue to expend significant resources to maintain security protections that limit the effect of bugs, theft, misuse, and security vulnerabilities or breaches.
we experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems on a regular basis. cyber attacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. we have seen, and will continue to see, industry-wide software supply chain vulnerabilities, such as the log4j vulnerability reported in december 2021, which could affect our or other parties' systems. we expect to continue to experience such incidents or vulnerabilities in the future. our efforts to address undesirable activity on our platform may also increase the risk of retaliatory attack. in addition, we face the risk of cyber attacks by nation-states and state-sponsored actors. these attacks may target us or our customers, particularly our public sector customers (including federal, state, and local governments). geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts, such as the ongoing conflict in ukraine, may increase these risks.
we may experience security issues, whether due to employee or insider error or malfeasance, system errors, or vulnerabilities in our or other parties' systems. while we may not determine some of these issues to be material at the time they occur and may remedy them quickly, there is no guarantee that these issues will not ultimately result in significant legal, financial, and reputational harm, including government inquiries, enforcement actions, litigation, and negative publicity. there is also no guarantee that a series of issues may not be determined to be material at a later date in the aggregate, even if they may not be material individually at the time of their occurrence. because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, disable or degrade service provided by or otherwise sabotage systems change frequently and often are recognized only after being launched against a target, even taking all reasonable precautions, including those required by law, we have been unable in the past and may continue to be unable to anticipate or detect attacks or vulnerabilities or implement adequate preventative measures.
further, if any partners with whom we share user or other customer information fail to implement adequate data-security practices, fail to comply with our terms and policies, or otherwise suffer a network or other security breach, our users' data may be improperly accessed, used, or disclosed. if an actual or perceived breach of our or our business partners' or service providers' security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures would be harmed, we could lose users and customers, our trade secrets or those of our business partners may be compromised, and we may be exposed to significant legal and financial risks, including legal claims (which may include class-action litigation) and regulatory actions, fines, and penalties. any of the foregoing consequences could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.
while we have dedicated significant resources to privacy and security incident response capabilities, including dedicated worldwide incident response teams, our response process, particularly during times of a natural disaster or pandemic, may not be adequate, may fail to accurately assess the severity of an incident, may not be fast enough to prevent or limit harm, or may fail to sufficiently remediate an incident. as a result, we may suffer significant legal, reputational, or financial exposure, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.
for additional information, see also our risk factor on privacy and data protection regulations under 'risks related to laws, regulations, and policies' below.
our ongoing investments in safety, security, and content review will likely continue to identify abuse of our platforms and misuse of user data.
in addition to our efforts to prevent and mitigate cyber attacks, we are making significant investments in safety, security, and review efforts to combat misuse of our services and unauthorized access to user data by third parties, including investigation and review of platform applications that could access the information of users of our services. as a result of these efforts, we have in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, incidents of unnecessary access to or misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties. however, we may not have discovered, and may in the future not discover, all such incidents or activity, whether as a result of our data limitations, including alphabet inc.
our lack of visibility over our encrypted services, the scale of activity on our platform, or other factors, including factors outside of our control such as a natural disaster or pandemic, and we may learn of such incidents or activity via third parties. such incidents and activities may include the use of user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our terms, contracts or policies, the existence of false or undesirable user accounts, election interference, improper ad purchases, activities that threaten people's safety on- or off-line, or instances of spamming, scraping, or spreading disinformation. while we may not determine some of these incidents to be material at the time they occurred and we may remedy them quickly, there is no guarantee that these issues will not ultimately result in significant legal, financial, and reputational harm, including government inquiries and enforcement actions, litigation, and negative publicity. there is also no guarantee that a series of issues may not be determined to be material at a later date in the aggregate, even if they may not be material individually at the time of their occurrence.
we may also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise prevent or remediate any such incidents. any of the foregoing developments may negatively affect user trust and engagement, harm our reputation and brands, require us to change our business practices in ways that harm our business operations, and adversely affect our business and financial results. any such developments may also subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries, which could result in monetary penalties and damages, divert management's time and attention, and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight.
problematic content on our platforms, including low-quality user-generated content, web spam, content farms, and other violations of our guidelines could affect the quality of our services, which could harm our reputation and deter our current and potential users from using our products and services.
we, like others in the industry, face violations of our content guidelines across our platforms, including sophisticated attempts by bad actors to manipulate our hosting and advertising systems to fraudulently generate revenues, or to otherwise generate traffic that does not represent genuine user interest or intent. while we invest significantly in efforts to promote high-quality and relevant results and to detect and prevent low-quality content and invalid traffic, we have been unable and may continue to be unable to detect and prevent all such abuses or promote uniformly high-quality content.
many websites violate or attempt to violate our guidelines, including by seeking to inappropriately rank higher in search results than our search engine's assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them. such efforts have affected, and may continue to affect, the quality of content on our platforms and lead them to display false, misleading, or undesirable content. although english-language web spam in our search results has been reduced, and web spam in most other languages is limited, we expect web spammers will continue to seek inappropriate ways to improve their rankings. we continuously combat web spam in our search results, including through indexing technology that makes it harder for spam-like, less useful web content to rank highly. we also continue to invest in and deploy proprietary technology to detect and prevent web spam on our platforms. we also face other challenges from low-quality and irrelevant content websites, including content farms, which are websites that generate large quantities of low-quality content to help them improve their search rankings. we are continually launching algorithmic changes designed to detect and prevent abuse from low-quality websites. we also face other challenges on our platforms, including violations of our content guidelines involving incidents such as attempted election interference, activities that threaten the safety and/or well-being of our users on- or off-line, and the spreading of misinformation or disinformation.
if we fail to either detect and prevent an increase in problematic content or effectively promote high-quality content, it could hurt our reputation for delivering relevant information or reduce use of our platforms, harming our financial condition and operating results. it may also subject us to litigation and regulatory actions, which could result in monetary penalties and damages and divert management's time and attention.
our business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the internet by us and our users. internet access providers may be able to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers.
our products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the internet, and certain of our products require significant bandwidth to work effectively. currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile communications companies, and government-owned service providers. some of these providers have taken, or have stated that they may take, measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings, by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings, or by providing our competitors preferential access. some jurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination by internet access providers; however, substantial uncertainty exists in the u.s. and elsewhere regarding such protections. for example, in 2018 the u.s. federal communications commission repealed net neutrality rules, which could permit alphabet inc.
internet access providers to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services. in addition, in some jurisdictions, our products and services have been subject to government-initiated restrictions or blockages. these could harm existing key relationships, including with our users, customers, advertisers, and/or content providers, and impair our ability to attract new ones; harm our reputation; and increase costs, thereby negatively affecting our business.
risks related to laws, regulations, and policies we are subject to a variety of new, existing, and changing laws and regulations worldwide that could harm our business, and will likely be subject to an even broader scope of laws and regulations as we continue to expand our business.
we are subject to numerous u.s. and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subjects, and our introduction of new businesses, products, services, and technologies will likely continue to subject us to additional laws and regulations. in recent years, governments around the world have proposed and adopted a large number of new laws and regulations relevant to the digital economy, particularly in the areas of data privacy and security, competition, and online content. the costs of compliance with these measures are high and are likely to increase in the future.
new or changing laws and regulations, or new interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations in a manner inconsistent with our practices, have resulted in, and may continue to result in, less useful products and services, altered business practices, limited ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products and services, substantial costs, and civil or criminal liability. examples include laws and regulations regarding:
•competition and technology platforms' business practices: laws and regulations focused on large technology platforms, including the digital markets act in the european union (eu); regulations in south korea and elsewhere that affect google play's billing policies, fees, and business model; as well as regulations under consideration in a range of jurisdictions.
•data privacy, collection, and processing: laws and regulations further restricting the collection, processing, and/or sharing of user or advertising-related data, including privacy and data protection laws, laws affecting the processing of children's data (as discussed further below), data breach notification laws, and laws limiting data transfers (including data localization laws).
•copyright and other intellectual property: copyright and related laws, including the eu directive on copyright in the digital single market and european economic area transpositions, which may introduce new licensing regimes, increase liability with respect to content uploaded by users or linked to from our platforms, or create property rights in news publications that could require payments to news agencies and publishers.
•content moderation: various laws covering content moderation and removal, and related disclosure obligations, such as the eu's digital services act, florida's senate bill 7072 and texas' house bill 20, and laws and proposed legislation in singapore, australia, and the united kingdom that impose penalties for failure to remove certain types of content or require disclosure of information about the operation of our services and algorithms, which may make it harder for services like google search and youtube to detect and deal with low-quality, deceptive, or harmful content.
•consumer protection: consumer protection laws, including the eu's new deal for consumers, which could result in monetary penalties and create a range of new compliance obligations.
in addition, the applicability and scope of these and other laws and regulations, as interpreted by the courts, remain uncertain and could be interpreted in ways that harm our business. for example, we rely on statutory safe harbors, like those set forth in the digital millennium copyright act and section 230 of the communications decency act in the u.s. and the e-commerce directive in europe, to protect against liability for various linking, caching, ranking, recommending, and hosting activities. legislation or court rulings affecting these safe harbors may adversely affect us and may impose significant operational challenges. there are legislative proposals and pending litigation in the u.s. (such as gonzalez v. google), eu, and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor protection for websites and online platforms.
we are and may continue to be subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, enforcement actions, consent orders, and other forms of regulatory scrutiny and legal liability that could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.
we are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, and other matters. we also are subject to a variety of claims including alphabet inc.
product warranty, product liability, and consumer protection claims related to product defects, among other litigation, and we may also be subject to claims involving health and safety, hazardous materials usage, other environmental effects, or service disruptions or failures. claims have been brought, and we expect will continue to be brought, against us for defamation, negligence, breaches of contract, copyright and trademark infringement, unfair competition, unlawful activity, torts, privacy rights violations, fraud, or other legal theories based on the nature and content of information available on or via our services or due to our involvement in hosting, transmitting, marketing, branding, or providing access to content created by third parties.
for example, the u.s. department of justice, various u.s. states, and other plaintiffs have filed several antitrust lawsuits about various aspects of our business, including our advertising technologies and practices, the operation and distribution of google search, and the operation and distribution of the android operating system and play store. other regulatory agencies in the u.s. and around the world, including competition enforcers, consumer protection agencies, and data protection authorities, have challenged and may continue to challenge our business practices and compliance with laws and regulations. we are cooperating with these investigations and defending litigation where appropriate. various laws, regulations, investigations, enforcement lawsuits, and regulatory actions have in the past, and may in the future result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.
any of these legal proceedings could result in legal costs, diversion of management resources, negative publicity and other harms to our business. estimating liabilities for our pending litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that requires significant judgment, and the amounts we are ultimately liable for may exceed our estimates. the resolution of one or more such proceedings has resulted in, and may in the future result in, additional substantial fines, penalties, injunctions, and other sanctions that could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.
privacy, data protection, and data usage regulations are complex and rapidly evolving areas. any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.
authorities around the world have adopted and are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection, data usage, and encryption of user data. adverse legal rulings, legislation, or regulation have resulted in, and may continue to result in, fines and orders requiring that we change our practices, which have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on how we provide services, harming our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. these laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and compliance obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs or harm the quality and operations of our products and services in ways that harm our business. examples of these laws include:
•the general data protection regulation and the united kingdom general data protection regulations, which apply to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the eu or the united kingdom, respectively, or related to products and services that we offer to eu or the united kingdom users or customers, respectively, or the monitoring of their behavior in the eu or the uk, respectively.
•various state and foreign privacy laws and regulations, such as the california consumer privacy act of 2018, the california privacy rights act, the virginia consumer data protection act, the colorado privacy act, the connecticut data privacy act, and the utah consumer privacy act, all of which give new data privacy rights to their respective residents (including, in california, a private right of action in the event of a data breach resulting from our failure to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices) and impose significant obligations on controllers and processors of consumer data.
•state laws governing the processing of biometric information, such as the illinois biometric information privacy act and the texas capture or use of biometric identifier act, which impose obligations on businesses that collect or disclose consumer biometric information.
•various federal, state, and foreign laws governing how companies provide age appropriate experiences to children and minors, including the collection and processing of children and minor's data. these include the children's online privacy protection act of 1998, the united kingdom age-appropriate design code, and the california age appropriate design code, all of which address the use and disclosure of the personal data of children and minors and impose obligations on online services or products directed to or likely to be accessed by children.
•the california internet of things security law, which regulates the security of data used in connection with internet-connected devices.
•the eu's digital markets act, which will require in-scope companies to obtain user consent for combining data across certain products and require search engines to share anonymized data with rival companies, among other changes.
further, we are subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process and/or receive personal data. previously available transfer mechanisms, such as the eu-u.s. and the swiss-u.s. privacy shield frameworks, were invalidated in 2020, and other bases for data transfer and storage, such as standard contractual clauses, remain subject to ongoing review in ways that may require us to adapt our existing contractual arrangements. the validity of various data transfer mechanisms remains subject to legal, regulatory, and political developments in both europe and the u.s., including the potential adoption of the u.s.-eu data privacy framework. until the u.s.-eu data privacy framework is adopted by the eu, the legal uncertainty and ongoing enforcement action from supervisory authorities related to cross-border transfers of personal data, could harm our ability to process and transfer personal data outside of the european economic area and could in turn harm our ability to provide, and our customers' ability to use, some of our products and services.
we face, and may continue to face, intellectual property and other claims that could be costly to defend, result in significant damage awards or other costs (including indemnification awards), and limit our ability to use certain technologies.
we, like other internet, technology, and media companies, are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights, including patent, copyright, trade secrets, and trademarks. parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in u.s. and international courts and the u.s. international trade commission (itc) for exclusion and cease-and-desist orders. in addition, patent-holding companies may frequently seek to generate income from patents they have obtained by bringing claims against us. as we continue to expand our business, the number of intellectual property claims against us has increased and may continue to increase as we develop and acquire new products, services, and technologies.
adverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements (if licenses are available at all), or orders limiting our ability to sell our products and services in the u.s. or elsewhere, including by preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services in certain jurisdictions. they may also cause us to change our business practices in ways that could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business.
many of our agreements with our customers and partners, including certain suppliers, require us to defend against certain intellectual property infringement claims and in some cases indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them, which could result in increased costs for defending such claims or significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. such customers and partners may also discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and harm our business. moreover, intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our suppliers, when obtainable, may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers arising from intellectual property infringement claims. furthermore, in connection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, including those associated with intellectual property claims. regardless of their merits, intellectual property claims are often time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle. to the extent such claims are successful, they could harm our business, including our product and service offerings, financial condition, and operating results.
expectations relating to environmental, social, and governance (esg) considerations could expose us to potential liabilities, increased costs, and reputational harm.
we are subject to laws, regulations, and other measures that govern a wide range of topics, including those related to matters beyond our core products and services. for instance, new laws, regulations, policies, and international accords relating to esg matters, including sustainability, climate change, human capital, and diversity, are being developed and formalized in europe, the u.s., and elsewhere, which may entail specific, target-driven frameworks and/or disclosure requirements. we have implemented robust esg programs, adopted reporting frameworks and principles, and announced a number of goals and initiatives. the implementation of these goals and initiatives may require considerable investments, and our goals, with all of their contingencies, dependencies, and in certain cases, reliance on third-party verification and/or performance, are complex and ambitious, may change, and we cannot guarantee that we will achieve them. any failure, or perceived failure, by us to adhere to our public statements, comply fully with developing interpretations of esg laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.
we could be subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new u.s. or international tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities.
we are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the u.s. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. our effective tax rates are affected by a variety of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates, net gains and losses on hedges and related transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program, decreases in our stock price for shares issued as employee compensation, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, and the application of different provisions of tax laws or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles (including changes in the interpretation of existing laws). further, if we are unable or fail to collect taxes on behalf of customers, employees and partners as the withholding agent, we could become liable for taxes that are levied against third parties.
we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. as a result, we have received, and may in the future receive, assessments in multiple jurisdictions, on various tax-related assertions, such as transfer-pricing adjustments or permanent-establishment claims. any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could harm our financial condition and operating results, require adverse changes to our business practices, or subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries. in addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and often involves uncertainty. although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.
furthermore, due to shifting economic and political conditions, tax policies, laws, or rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant changes in ways that could harm our financial condition and operating results. various jurisdictions around the world have enacted or are considering revenue-based taxes such as digital services taxes and other targeted taxes, which could lead to inconsistent and potentially overlapping international tax regimes. the organization for economic cooperation and development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules.
risks related to ownership of our stock we cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program will be fully consummated or will enhance long-term stockholder value, and share repurchases could increase the volatility of our stock prices and could diminish our cash reserves.
we engage in share repurchases of our class a and class c stock from time to time in accordance with authorizations from the board of directors of alphabet. our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and does not obligate alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. further, our share repurchases could affect our share trading prices, increase their volatility, reduce our cash reserves and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock.
the concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders' ability to influence corporate matters.
our class b stock has 10 votes per share, our class a stock has one vote per share, and our class c stock has no voting rights. as of december 31, 2022, larry page and sergey brin beneficially owned approximately 85.8% of our outstanding class b stock, which represented approximately 51.2% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. through their stock ownership, larry and sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets, for the foreseeable future. in addition, because our class c stock carries no voting rights (except as required by applicable law), the issuance of the class c stock, including in future stock-based acquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs, could continue larry and sergey's current relative voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. the share repurchases made pursuant to our repurchase program may also affect larry and sergey's relative voting power. this concentrated control limits or severely restricts other stockholders' ability to influence corporate matters and we may take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial, which could reduce the market price of our class a stock and our class c stock.
provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.
provisions in alphabet's certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. these provisions include the following:
•our stockholders may not act by written consent, which makes it difficult to take certain actions without holding a stockholders' meeting.
•our certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. this limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates.
•stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders' meeting. these provisions may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer's own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.
•our board of directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock, which makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.
as a delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain delaware anti-takeover provisions. under delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its outstanding voting stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.
the trading price for our class a stock and non-voting class c stock may continue to be volatile.
the trading price of our stock has at times experienced significant volatility and may continue to be volatile. in addition to the factors discussed in this report, the trading prices of our class a stock and class c stock have fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate widely, in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, among others, the activities of our peers and changes in broader economic and political conditions around the world. these broad market and industry factors could harm the market price of our class a stock and our class c stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.
general risks the continuing effects of the covid-19 pandemic and its impact are highly unpredictable and could be significant, and could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.
our business, operations and financial performance have been, and may continue to be, affected by the macroeconomic impacts resulting from covid-19, and as a result, our revenue growth rate and expenses as a percentage of our revenues in future periods may differ significantly from our historical rates, and our future operating results may fall below expectations. the extent to which our business will continue to be affected will depend on a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including the persistence of the pandemic, impacts on economic activity, and the possibility of recession or continued financial market instability.
our operating results have fluctuated, and may in the future fluctuate, as a result of a number of factors, many outside of our control, including the cyclicality and seasonality in our business and geopolitical events. as a result, comparing our operating results (including our expenses as a percentage of our revenues) on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and our past results should not be relied on as an indication of our future performance. consequently, our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations.
acquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other consequences that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.
acquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures are important elements of our overall corporate strategy and use of capital, and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and operating results. we expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of such potential strategic transactions, which could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. some of the areas where we face risks include:
•diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenges related to acquisitions and other strategic transactions;
•failure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis, if at all, from governmental authorities, or conditions placed upon approval that could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of a transaction;
•failure to successfully integrate the acquired operations, technologies, services, and personnel (including cultural integration and retention of employees) and further develop the acquired business or technology;
•implementation or remediation of controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company;
•integration of the acquired company's accounting and other administrative systems, and the coordination of product, engineering, and sales and marketing functions;
•transition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms;
•in the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries;
•failure to accomplish commercial, strategic or financial objectives with respect to investments and joint ventures;
•failure to realize the value of investments and joint ventures due to a lack of liquidity;
•liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, data privacy and security issues, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, warranty claims, product liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities; and
•litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders, or other third parties.
our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and other strategic transactions could cause us to fail to realize their anticipated benefits, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally.
our acquisitions and other strategic transactions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, or impairment of goodwill and/or purchased long-lived assets, and restructuring charges, any of which could harm our financial condition and operating results. also, the anticipated benefits or value of our acquisitions and other strategic transactions may not materialize. in connection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.
if we were to lose the services of key personnel, we may not be able to execute our business strategy.
our future success depends in large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team. for instance, sundar pichai is critical to the overall management of alphabet and its subsidiaries and plays an important role in the development of our technology, maintaining our culture, and setting our strategic direction. all of our executive officers and key employees are at-will employees, and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance policies. the loss of key personnel could harm our business.
we rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel, or maintain and continue to adapt our corporate culture, we may not be able to grow or operate effectively.
our performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. our ability to compete effectively and our future success depends on our continuing to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense, and certain of our competitors have directly targeted, and may continue to target, our employees. in addition, our compensation arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. restrictive immigration policy and regulatory changes may also affect our ability to hire, mobilize, or retain some of our global talent.
in addition, we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. as our organization grows and evolves, we may need to implement more complex organizational management structures or adapt our corporate culture and work environments to ever-changing circumstances, such as during times of a natural disaster or pandemic, and these changes could affect our ability to compete effectively or have an adverse effect on our corporate culture. as we experiment with hybrid work models, we may experience increased costs and/or disruption, in addition to potential effects on our ability to operate effectively and maintain our corporate culture.
item 7.management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations please read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with "note about forward-looking statements," part i, item 1 "business," part i, item 1a "risk factors," and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
we have omitted discussion of 2020 results where it would be redundant to the discussion previously included in item 7 of our 2021 annual report on form 10-k.
understanding alphabet's financial results alphabet is a collection of businesses - the largest of which is google. we report google in two segments, google services and google cloud; we also report all non-google businesses collectively as other bets. for further details on our segments, see part i, item 1 "business" and note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
trends in our business and financial effect the following long-term trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate that they will continue to affect our future results:
•users' behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves.
the continuing shift from an offline to online world has contributed to the growth of our business and our revenues since inception. we expect that this shift to an online world will continue to benefit our business and our revenues, although at a slower pace than we have experienced historically, in particular after the outsized growth in our advertising revenues during the covid-19 pandemic. in addition, we face increasing competition for user engagement and advertisers, which may affect our revenues.
•users continue to access our products and services using diverse devices and modalities, which allows for new advertising formats that may benefit our revenues but adversely affect our margins.
our users are accessing the internet via diverse devices and modalities, such as smartphones, wearables, and smart home devices, and want to be able to be connected no matter where they are or what they are doing. we are focused on expanding our products and services to stay in front of these trends in order to maintain and grow our business.
we benefit from advertising revenues generated from different channels, including mobile, and newer advertising formats. the margins from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional desktop search. additionally, as the market for a particular device type or modality matures, our advertising revenues may be affected. for example, growth in the global smartphone market has slowed due to various factors, including increased market saturation in developed countries, which can affect our mobile advertising revenues.
we expect tac paid to our distribution partners and google network partners to increase as our revenues grow and tac as a percentage of our advertising revenues ("tac rate") to be affected by changes in device mix; geographic mix; partner mix; partner agreement terms; the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points; product mix; the relative revenue growth rates of advertising revenues from different channels; and revenue share terms.
as interactions between users and advertisers change, and as online user behavior evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings to serve these changing needs, which may affect our monetization. for example, revenues from ads on youtube and google play monetize at a lower rate than our traditional search ads. we also may develop new products incorporating ai innovations that could affect our monetization trends. additionally, when developing new products and services we generally focus first on user experience before prioritizing monetization.
•as users in developing economies increasingly come online, our revenues from international markets continue to increase, and may require continued investments. in addition, movements in foreign exchange rates affect such revenues.
the shift to online, as well as the advent of the multi-device world, has brought opportunities outside of the u.s., including in emerging markets, such as india. we continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our products and advertising programs relevant to our users in these markets. this has led to a trend of increased alphabet inc.
revenues from emerging markets. we expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these markets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available. this trend could affect our revenues as developing markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets.
international revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the u.s. dollar. while we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings.
non-advertising revenues have grown over time, and we expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our products and services. the margins on these revenues vary significantly and are generally lower than the margins on our advertising revenues. in particular margins on our hardware products adversely affect our consolidated margins due to pressures on pricing and higher cost of sales.
•as we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and capital expenditures.
we continue to make significant research and development investments in areas of strategic focus as we seek to develop new, innovative offerings and improve our existing offerings across our businesses. we also expect to continue to invest in our technical infrastructure, including servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term initiatives, in particular in support of ai. in addition acquisitions and strategic investments contribute to the breadth and depth of our offerings, expand our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, and build strong partnerships around strategic initiatives. for example, in september 2022 we closed the acquisition of mandiant to help expand our offerings in dynamic cyber defense and response.
•we face continuing changes in regulatory conditions, laws, and public policies, which could affect our business practices and financial results.
changes in social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide range of topics and related legal matters have resulted in fines and caused us to change our business practices. as these global trends continue, our cost of doing business may increase, our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products or services may be limited, and we may need to change our business practices. examples include the antitrust complaints filed by the u.s. department of justice and a number of state attorneys general; pending litigation in the u.s., eu, and around the world that could diminish or eliminate safe harbor protection for websites and online platforms; and the digital markets act and digital services act in europe and various legislative proposals in the u.s. focused on large technology platforms. for additional information see item 1a risk factors and legal matters in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8.
•our employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them.
our employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. we expect to continue hiring talented employees around the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs. for additional information see culture and workforce in part i, item 1 "business."
revenues and monetization metrics we generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide enterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure and platform services as well as communication and collaboration tools; sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products. for details on how we recognize revenue, see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
in addition to the long-term trends and their financial effect on our business noted above, fluctuations in our revenues have been and may continue to be affected by a combination of factors, including:
•changes in foreign currency exchange rates;
•changes in pricing, such as those resulting from changes in fee structures, discounts, and customer incentives;
•general economic conditions and various external dynamics, including geopolitical events, regulations, and other measures and their effect on advertiser, consumer, and enterprise spending;
•seasonality.
additionally, fluctuations in our revenues generated from advertising ("google advertising"), revenues from other sources ("google other revenues"), google cloud, and other bets revenues have been and may continue to be affected by other factors unique to each set of revenues, as described below.
•google network, which includes revenues generated on google network properties participating in admob, adsense, and google ad manager.
we use certain metrics to track how well traffic across various properties is monetized as it relates to our advertising revenues: paid clicks and cost-per-click pertain to traffic on google search & other properties, while impressions and cost-per-impression pertain to traffic on our google network properties.
paid clicks represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users on google search properties and other google owned and operated properties including gmail, google maps, and google play. cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.
impressions include impressions displayed to users on google network properties participating primarily in admob, adsense, and google ad manager. cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based revenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for each impression displayed to users.
as our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues generated by the corresponding click and impression activity.
fluctuations in our advertising revenues, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on google search & other properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on google network properties and the correlation between these items have been and may continue to be affected by additional factors, such as:
•advertiser competition for keywords;
•changes in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy;
•changes in device mix;
•seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends, such as traditional retail seasonality; and
•traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various verticals and channels.
•hardware, which includes sales of fitbit wearable devices, google nest home products, and pixel devices;
fluctuations in our google other revenues have been and may continue to be affected by additional factors, such as changes in customer usage and demand, number of subscribers, and fluctuations in the timing of product launches.
•google cloud platform, which includes fees for infrastructure, platform, and other services;
•google workspace, which includes fees for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for enterprises, such as gmail, docs, drive, calendar and meet; and
•other enterprise services.
fluctuations in our google cloud revenues have been and may continue to be affected by additional factors, such as customer usage.
other bets revenues from other bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.
costs and expenses our cost structure has two components: cost of revenues and operating expenses. our operating expenses include costs related to r&d, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. certain of our costs and expenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue.
cost of revenues cost of revenues is comprised of tac and other costs of revenues.
◦amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers.
◦amounts paid to google network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.
◦content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution on youtube and google play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee).
◦expenses associated with our data centers (including bandwidth, compensation expenses, depreciation, energy, and other equipment costs) as well as other operations costs (such as content review as well as customer and product support costs).
◦inventory and other costs related to the hardware we sell.
tac as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on google network properties are significantly higher than tac as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on google search & other properties, because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on google network properties are paid as tac to our google network partners.
operating expenses operating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as either r&d, sales and marketing, or general and administrative.
•compensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for r&d related to our existing and new products and services;
•third-party services fees primarily relating to consulting and outsourced services in support of our engineering and product development efforts.
the main components of our sales and marketing expenses are:
•compensation expenses for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain customer service functions; and
•spending relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services.
•compensation expenses for employees in finance, human resources, information technology, legal, and other administrative support functions;
•third-party services fees, including audit, consulting, outside legal, and other outsourced administrative services.
other income (expense), net other income (expense), net primarily consists of interest income (expense), the effect of foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net gains (losses) and impairment on our marketable and non-marketable securities, performance fees, and income (loss) and impairment from our equity method investments.
for additional details, including how we account for our investments and factors that can drive fluctuations in the value of our investments, see note 1 and note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k as well as item 7a, "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk".
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes represents the estimated amount of federal, state, and foreign income taxes incurred in the u.s. and the many jurisdictions in which we operate. the provision includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties.

•cost of revenues was $126.2 billion, an increase of 14% year over year, primarily driven by an increase in other costs of revenues.
other information:
•on september 12, 2022, we closed the acquisition of mandiant for a total purchase price of $6.1 billion and added more than 2,600 employees. mandiant's financial results are reported within google cloud as of the acquisition date. see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information.

in addition, we are taking actions to optimize our global office space. as a result we expect to incur exit costs relating to office space reductions of approximately $0.5 billion in the first quarter of 2023. we may incur additional charges in the future as we further evaluate our real estate needs.
•in january 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment, resulting in a change in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment to six years, which we expect to result in a reduction of depreciation of approximately $3.4 billion for the full fiscal year 2023 for assets in service as of december 31, 2022, recorded primarily in cost of revenues and r&d expenses.
•as ai is critical to delivering our mission of bringing our breakthrough innovations into the real world, beginning in january 2023, we will update our segment reporting relating to certain of alphabet's ai activities. deepmind, previously reported within other bets, will be reported as part of alphabet's corporate costs, reflecting its increasing collaboration with google services, google cloud, and other bets. prior periods will be recast to conform to the revised presentation. see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for information relating to our segments.

use of non-gaap constant currency information international revenues, which represent a significant portion of our revenues, are generally transacted in multiple currencies and therefore are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
the effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons. we use non-gaap constant currency revenues ("constant currency revenues") and non-gaap percentage change in constant currency revenues ("percentage change in constant currency revenues") for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) results helps improve the ability to understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.
constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. we define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements ("fx effect") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. we use constant currency revenues to determine the constant currency revenue percentage change on a year-on-year basis. constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.
constant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period revenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods.
these results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with gaap. results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with gaap.

(1)total constant currency revenues of $294.2 billion for 2022 increased $36.7 billion compared to $257.5 billion in revenues, excluding hedging effect for 2021.
emea revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the u.s. dollar strengthening relative to the euro and the british pound.
apac revenue growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the u.s. dollar strengthening relative to the japanese yen and the australian dollar.
other americas growth was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the u.s. dollar strengthening relative to the argentine peso.
costs and expenses cost of revenues the following table presents cost of revenues, including tac (in millions, except percentages):
the increase in tac from 2021 to 2022 was due to an increase in tac paid to distribution partners and to google network partners, primarily driven by growth in revenues subject to tac. the tac rate was 22% in both 2021 and 2022. the tac rate on google search & other revenues and the tac rate on google network revenues were both substantially consistent from 2021 to 2022.
the increase in other cost of revenues from 2021 to 2022 was primarily due to increases in data center costs and other operations costs as well as hardware costs.
research and development the following table presents r&d expenses (in millions, except percentages):
research and development expenses                                               $31,562                         $39,500

sales and marketing expenses increased $3.7 billion from 2021 to 2022, primarily driven by an increase in compensation expenses of $1.8 billion, largely resulting from a 19% increase in average headcount, and an increase in advertising and promotional activities of $1.3 billion.
general and administrative expenses increased $2.2 billion from 2021 to 2022. the increase was primarily driven by an increase in compensation expenses of $1.1 billion, largely resulting from a 21% increase in average headcount, and an increase in third-party services fees of $815 million. in addition, there was a $551 million increase to the allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable, as the prior year comparable period reflected a decline in the allowance.

corporate costs, unallocated(1)                   (4,761)                         (2,679)
(1)unallocated corporate costs primarily include corporate initiatives, corporate shared costs, such as finance and legal, including certain fines and settlements, as well as costs associated with certain shared r&d activities. additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are included in corporate costs and totaled $149 million and $2.0 billion in 2021 and 2022, respectively.
other income (expense), net, decreased $15.5 billion from 2021 to 2022 primarily due to changes in gains and losses on equity securities and performance fees. in 2022, $3.2 billion of net unrealized losses were recognized on marketable equity securities and $1.5 billion of net realized losses were recognized on debt securities. these losses were partially offset by interest income of $2.2 billion and reversals of previously accrued performance fees related to certain investments of $798 million. in 2021, $9.8 billion of net unrealized gains were recognized on non-marketable equity securities and $1.5 billion of interest income was recognized, partially offset by $1.9 billion of accrued performance fees related to certain investments.

the effective tax rate decreased from 2021 to 2022, primarily driven by the effects of capitalization and amortization of r&d expenses in 2022 as required by the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act generating an increase in the u.s. federal foreign derived intangible income tax deduction. the decrease was partially offset by a decrease in pre-tax earnings, including in countries that have lower statutory rates and a decrease in the stock-based compensation related tax benefit. see note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information.
financial condition cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of december 31, 2022, we had $113.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities. cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market funds, highly liquid government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, and marketable equity securities.
sources, uses of cash, and related trends our principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from operations. the primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long-term growth of the business. we regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace, and form of capital return to stockholders.
net cash provided by operating activities                $91,652                           $91,495

cash provided by operating activities our largest source of cash provided by operations are advertising revenues generated by google search & other properties, google network properties, and youtube properties. additionally, we generate cash through sales of apps and in-app purchases, and hardware; and licensing and service fees, including fees received for google cloud offerings and subscription-based products.
our primary uses of cash from operating activities include payments to distribution and google network partners, to employees for compensation, and to content providers. other uses of cash from operating activities include payments to suppliers for hardware, to tax authorities for income taxes, and other general corporate expenditures.
net cash provided by operating activities decreased from 2021 to 2022 primarily due to the net effect of an increase in cash received from revenues, offset by increases in cash paid for cost of revenues and operating expenses and an increase in tax payments driven by the effects of capitalization and amortization of r&d expenses beginning in 2022 as required by the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act.
cash used in investing activities cash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of investments in marketable and non-marketable securities. cash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of marketable and non-marketable securities, purchases of property and equipment, and payments for acquisitions.
net cash used in investing activities decreased from 2021 to 2022 as a result of a decrease in net purchases of and maturities and sales of marketable securities, partially offset by an increase in purchases of property and equipment.
cash used in financing activities cash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from the sale of interest in consolidated entities. cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of stock, net payments related to stock-based award activities, and repayments of debt.
net cash used in financing activities increased from 2021 to 2022 primarily due to an increase in repurchases of stock.
liquidity and material cash requirements we expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, cash flows from operations and financing activities to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.
capital expenditures and leases we make investments in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology assets through purchases of property and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our services and products.
capital expenditures our capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories:
•technical infrastructure, which consists of our investments in servers and network equipment for computing, storage, and networking requirements for ongoing business activities, including ai, (collectively referred to as our information technology assets) and data center land and building construction; and
•office facilities, ground-up development projects, and building improvements (also referred to as "fit-outs").
construction in progress consists primarily of technical infrastructure and office facilities which have not yet been placed in service. the time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these assets may extend from months to years. for example, our data center construction projects are generally multi-year projects with multiple alphabet inc.
phases, where we acquire qualified land and buildings, construct buildings, and secure and install information technology assets.
during the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2022, we spent $24.6 billion and $31.5 billion on capital expenditures, respectively. depreciation of our property and equipment commences when the deployment of such assets are completed and are ready for our intended use. land is not depreciated. for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2022, our depreciation and impairment expenses on property and equipment were $11.6 billion and $15.3 billion, respectively.

for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2022, our operating lease expenses (including variable lease costs) were $3.4 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. finance lease costs were not material for the years ended december 31, 2021 and 2022. see note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information on leases.
financing we have a short-term debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. as of december 31, 2022, we had no commercial paper outstanding.
as of december 31, 2022, we had $10.0 billion of revolving credit facilities, $4.0 billion expiring in april 2023 and $6.0 billion expiring in april 2026. the interest rates for all credit facilities are determined based on a formula using certain market rates, as well as our progress toward the achievement of certain sustainability goals. no amounts have been borrowed under the credit facilities.
as of december 31, 2022, we had senior unsecured notes outstanding with a total carrying value of $12.9 billion with short-term and long-term future interest payments of $231 million and $3.8 billion, respectively. see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for further information on our debt.
we primarily utilize contract manufacturers for the assembly of our servers used in our technical infrastructure and hardware products we sell. we have agreements where we may purchase components directly from suppliers and then supply these components to contract manufacturers for use in the assembly of the servers and hardware products. certain of these arrangements result in a portion of the cash received from and paid to the contract manufacturers to be presented as financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows included in item 8 of this annual report on from 10-k.
share repurchase program in april 2022, the board of directors of alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $70.0 billion of its class a and class c shares. as of december 31, 2022, $28.1 billion remains available for class a and class c share repurchases. in accordance with the authorization of the board of directors of alphabet, during 2022 we repurchased and subsequently retired 530 million shares for $59.3 billion. of the aggregate amount repurchased and subsequently retired, 61 million shares were class a stock for $6.7 billion and 469 million shares were class c stock for $52.6 billion. see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
european commission fines in 2017, 2018 and 2019, the ec announced decisions that certain actions taken by google infringed european competition law and imposed fines of €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of june 27, 2017), €4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of june 30, 2018), and €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of march 20, 2019), respectively. on september 14, 2022, the general court reduced the 2018 fine from €4.3 billion to €4.1 billion. we subsequently filed an appeal to the european court of justice. in 2018 we recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in 2022.
while each ec decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines. for alphabet inc.
further details, see note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
taxes as of december 31, 2022, we had short-term and long-term income taxes payable of $1.6 billion and $4.2 billion related to a one-time transition tax payable incurred as a result of the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act ("tax act"). as permitted by the tax act, we will pay the transition tax in annual interest-free installments through 2025. we also have taxes payable of $5.1 billion primarily related to uncertain tax positions as of december 31, 2022.
purchase commitments as of december 31, 2022, we had material non-cancelable contractual obligations of $32.0 billion, of which $17.3 billion was short-term. these amounts represent the non-cancelable portion of agreements or the minimum cancellation fee and are primarily related to commitments to purchase licenses, technical infrastructure, inventory, and network capacity. for those agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of december 31, 2022.
in addition we regularly enter into multi-year, non-cancellable agreements to purchase renewable energy and energy attributes, such as renewable energy certificates. these agreements do not include a minimum dollar commitment. the amounts to be paid under these agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated and are not readily determinable.
critical accounting estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap. in doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions. our critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of uncertainty at the time the estimate was made, and changes in them have had or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. we base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. we have reviewed our critical accounting estimates with the audit and compliance committee of our board of directors.
see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for a summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements.
fair value measurements of non-marketable equity securities we measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, consisting primarily of our non-marketable equity securities. these investments are accounted for under the measurement alternative method ("the measurement alternative") and are measured at cost, less impairment, subject to upward and downward adjustments resulting from observable price changes for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. these adjustments require quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities, which may require the use of unobservable inputs. pricing adjustments are determined by using various valuation methodologies and involve the use of estimates using the best information available, which may include cash flow projections or other available market data.
non-marketable equity securities are also evaluated for impairment, based on qualitative factors including the companies' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among others. when indicators of impairment exist, we prepare quantitative measurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an income approach, which requires judgment and the use of unobservable inputs, including discount rates, investee revenues and costs, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among others. when the quantitative remeasurements of fair value indicate an impairment exists, we write down the investment to its current fair value.
we also have compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain investments, i.e. performance fees. we record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may result in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use of unobservable inputs.
property and equipment we assess the reasonableness of the useful lives of our property and equipment periodically as well as when other changes occur, such as when there are changes to ongoing business operations, changes in the planned use and utilization of assets, or technological advancements, that could indicate a change in the period over which we expect to benefit from the assets.
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.
recording an uncertain tax position involves various qualitative considerations, including evaluation of comparable and resolved tax exposures, applicability of tax laws, and likelihood of settlement. we evaluate uncertain tax positions periodically, considering changes in facts and circumstances, such as new regulations or recent judicial opinions, as well as the status of audit activities by taxing authorities. although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made.
the provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties. in addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue services (irs) and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
loss contingencies we are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury consumer protection, and other matters. certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. we record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. if we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k.
we evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our disclosures as appropriate. significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters. until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material.
change in accounting estimate in january 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network equipment, resulting in a change in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment to six years, which we expect to result in a reduction of depreciation of approximately $3.4 billion for the full fiscal year 2023 for assets in service as of december 31, 2022, recorded primarily in cost of revenues and r&d expenses. see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for information relating to the useful lives of our servers and network equipment.

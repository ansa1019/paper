item 1a.   risk factors risks related to our business difficult market and geopolitical conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways, each of which could materially reduce our revenue, earnings and cash flow and adversely affect our financial prospects and condition.
our business is materially affected by financial market and economic conditions and events throughout the world that are outside our control. we may not be able to or may choose not to manage our exposure to these conditions and/or events. such conditions and/or events can adversely affect our business in many ways, including by reducing the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital, reducing the value or performance of the investments made by our funds and making it more difficult to fund opportunities for our funds to exist and realize value from existing investment. this could in turn materially reduce our revenue, earnings and cash flow and adversely affect our financial prospects and condition. in addition, in the face of a difficult market or economic environment, we may need to reduce our fixed costs and other expenses in order to maintain profitability, including by cutting back or eliminating the use of certain services or service providers, or terminating the employment of a significant number of our personnel that, in each case, could be important to our business and without which our operating results could be adversely affected. a failure to manage or reduce our costs and other expenses within a time frame sufficient to match any decrease in profitability would adversely affect our operating performance.
turmoil in the global financial markets can provoke significant volatility of equity and debt securities prices. this can have a material and rapid impact on our mark-to-market valuations, particularly with respect to our public holdings and credit investments. as publicly traded equity securities have in recent years represented a significant proportion of the assets of many of our carry funds, stock market volatility, including a sharp decline in the stock market, such as the one experienced in the fourth quarter of 2018, may adversely affect our results, including our revenues and net income. in addition, our public equity holdings have at times been and are currently concentrated in a few large positions, thereby making our unrealized mark-to-market valuations particularly sensitive to sharp changes in the price of any of these positions. further, although the equity markets are not the only means by which we exit investments, should we experience another period of challenging equity markets, our funds may experience increased difficulty in realizing value from investments.
geopolitical concerns and other global events, including, without limitation, trade conflict, national and international political circumstances (including wars, terrorist acts or security operations) and pandemics or other severe public health events, have contributed and may continue to contribute to volatility in global equity and debt markets. 2019 was a year of significant geopolitical concerns, including, among other things, uncertainty regarding re-opening of the u.s. government after a shutdown in early 2019, trade tensions, most notably between china and the u.s., resulting from the implementation of tariffs by the u.s. and retaliatory tariffs by other countries on the u.s., continued tensions with north korea over its ballistic missile testing and nuclear programs, ongoing hostilities in the middle east and the possibility of their escalation, uncertainty regarding the u.k.'s ongoing negotiation of the circumstances surrounding its withdrawal from the european union and impeachment proceedings of president trump in the united states. such concerns have contributed and may continue to contribute to volatility in global equity and debt markets.
recently, the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in many countries continues to adversely impact global commercial activity, particularly in china, and has contributed to significant volatility in financial markets. the global impact of the outbreak has been rapidly evolving, and as cases of the virus have continued to be identified in additional countries, many countries have reacted by instituting quarantines and restrictions on travel. such actions are creating disruption in global supply chains, and adversely impacting a number of industries, such as transportation, hospitality and entertainment. the outbreak could have a continued adverse impact on economic and market conditions and trigger a period of global economic slowdown. the rapid development and fluidity of this situation precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact of the novel coronavirus. nevertheless, the novel coronavirus presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to our and our funds' performance and financial results.
in addition to the factors described above, other factors described herein that may affect market, economic and geopolitical conditions, and thereby adversely affect our business include, without limitation:
•   changes in interest rates and/or a lack of availability of credit in the u.s. and internationally;
•   commodity price volatility; and
•   changes in law and/or regulation, and uncertainty regarding government and regulatory policy.
a period of economic slowdown, which may be across one or more industries, sectors or geographies, could contribute to adverse operating performance for certain of our funds' investments, which would adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.
in recent years we have experienced buoyant markets and positive economic conditions. although such conditions have increasingly made it more difficult and competitive to find suitable capital deployment opportunities for our funds, they have also in many cases contributed to positive operating performance at our funds' portfolio companies. to the extent global markets enter a period of slower growth relative to recent years, such period of economic slowdown (which may be across one or more industries, sectors or geographies), may contribute to poor financial results at our funds' portfolio companies, which may result in lower investment returns for our funds. for example, periods of economic weakness have in the past and may in the future contribute to a decline in commodity prices and/or volatility in the oil and natural gas markets, each of which would have an adverse effect on our energy investments. the performance of our funds' portfolio companies would also likely be negatively impacted if pressure on wages and other inputs increasingly pressure profit margins. to the extent the performance of those portfolio companies (as well as valuation multiples) do not improve, our funds may sell those assets at values that are less than we projected or even a loss, thereby significantly affecting those investment funds' performance. in addition, as the governing agreements of our funds contain only limited requirements regarding diversification of fund investments (by, for example, sector or geographic region), during periods of economic slowdown in certain sectors or regions, the impact on our funds may be exacerbated by concentration of investments in such sector or region. as a result, our ability to raise new funds, as well as our operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.
in addition, during periods of weakness, our funds' portfolio companies may also have difficulty expanding their businesses and operations or meeting their debt service obligations or other expenses as they become due, including expenses payable to us. furthermore, such negative market conditions could potentially result in a portfolio company entering bankruptcy proceedings, thereby potentially resulting in a complete loss of the fund's investment in such portfolio company and a significant negative impact to the investment fund's performance and consequently to our operating results and cash flow, as well as to our reputation. in addition, negative market conditions would also increase the risk of default with respect to investments held by our funds that have significant debt investments, such as our credit-focused funds.
an increase in interest rates and other changes in the debt financing markets could negatively impact the ability of our funds and their portfolio companies to obtain attractive financing or refinancing and could increase the cost of such financing if it is obtained, which could lead to lower-yielding investments and potentially decrease our net income.
interest rates have remained at relatively low levels on a historical basis and the u.s. federal reserve lowered rates in multiple cuts in 2019, indicating that the current level would likely be held steady for the foreseeable future. there can be no assurance, however, that the federal reserve will not raise rates in 2020. a period of sharply rising interest rates could create downward pressure on the price of real estate, increase the cost and availability of debt financing for the transactions our funds pursue and decrease the value of fixed-rate debt investments made by our funds, each of which may have an adverse impact on our business. in addition, a significant contraction or weakening in the market for debt financing or other adverse change relating to the terms of debt financing (such as, for example, higher equity requirements and/or more restrictive covenants), particularly in the area of acquisition financings for private equity and real estate transactions, could have a material adverse impact on our business. for example, a portion of the indebtedness used to finance certain fund investments often includes high-yield debt securities issued in the capital markets. availability of capital from the high-yield debt markets is subject to significant volatility, and there may be times when we might not be able to access those markets at attractive rates, or at all, when completing an investment. for example, in late 2018 the credit markets experienced a contraction in the availability of credit, which temporarily impacted the ability to obtain attractive debt financing transactions. further, the financing of acquisitions or the operations of our funds' portfolio companies with debt may become less attractive due to limitations on the deductibility of corporate interest expense. see "- comprehensive u.s. federal income tax reform became effective in 2018, which could adversely affect us."
if our funds are unable to obtain committed debt financing for potential acquisitions, can only obtain debt financing at an increased interest rate or on unfavorable terms or the ability to deduct corporate interest expense is substantially limited, our funds may face increased competition from strategic buyers of assets who may have an overall lower cost of capital or the ability to benefit from a higher amount of cost savings following an acquisition, or may have difficulty completing otherwise profitable acquisitions or may generate profits that are lower than would otherwise be the case, each of which could lead to a decrease in our revenues. in addition, rising interest rates, coupled with periods of significant equity and credit market volatility may potentially make it more difficult for us to find attractive opportunities for our funds to exit and realize value from their existing investments.
our funds' portfolio companies also regularly utilize the corporate debt markets in order to obtain financing for their operations. to the extent monetary policy, tax or other regulatory changes or difficult credit markets render such financing difficult to obtain, more expensive or otherwise less attractive, this may also negatively impact the financial results of those portfolio companies and, therefore, the investment returns on our funds. in addition, to the extent that market conditions and/or tax or other regulatory changes make it difficult or impossible to refinance debt that is maturing in the near term, some of our funds' portfolio companies may be unable to repay such debt at maturity and may be forced to sell assets, undergo a recapitalization or seek bankruptcy protection.
a decline in the pace or size of investment made by our funds may adversely affect our revenues.
the revenues that we earn are driven in part by the pace at which our funds make investments and the size of those investments, and a decline in the pace or the size of such investments may reduce our revenues. the market environment for private equity transactions, for example, recently has been and continues to be characterized by relatively high prices, which can make the deployment of capital more difficult. in addition, many other factors could cause a decline in the pace of investment, including the inability of our investment professionals to identify attractive investment opportunities, competition for such opportunities among other potential acquirers, decreased availability of capital on attractive terms and our failure to consummate identified investment opportunities because of business, regulatory or legal complexities or uncertainty and adverse developments in the u.s. or global economy or financial markets. in addition, if our funds are unable to deploy capital at a pace that is sufficient to offset the pace of realizations, our fee revenues could decrease.
our revenue, earnings, net income and cash flow can all vary materially, which may make it difficult for us to achieve steady earnings growth on a quarterly basis and may cause the price of our class a common stock to decline.
our revenue, net income and cash flow can all vary materially due to our reliance on performance revenues. we may experience fluctuations in our results, including our revenue and net income, from quarter to quarter due to a number of other factors, including timing of realizations, changes in the valuations of our funds' investments, changes in the amount of distributions, dividends or interest paid in respect of investments, changes in our operating expenses, the degree to which we encounter competition and general economic and market conditions. achieving steady growth in net income and cash flow on a quarterly basis may be difficult, which could in turn lead to large adverse movements or general increased volatility in the price of our class a common stock. we also do not provide any guidance regarding our expected quarterly and annual operating results. the lack of guidance may affect the expectations of public market analysts and could cause increased volatility in our class a common stock price.
our cash flow may fluctuate significantly due to the fact that we receive performance allocations from our carry funds only when investments are realized and achieve a certain preferred return. performance allocations depend on our carry funds' performance and opportunities for realizing gains, which may be limited. it takes a substantial period of time to identify attractive investment opportunities, to raise all the funds needed to make an investment and then to realize the cash value (or other proceeds) of an investment through a sale, public offering, recapitalization or other exit. even if an investment proves to be profitable, it may be a number of years before any profits can be realized in cash (or other proceeds). we cannot predict when, or if, any realization of investments will occur.
the mark-to-market valuations of investments made by our funds are subject to volatility driven by economic and market conditions. economic and market conditions may also negatively impact our realization opportunities.
the valuations of and realization opportunities for investments made by our funds could also be subject to high volatility as a result of uncertainty regarding governmental policy with respect to, among other things, tax, financial services regulation, international trade, immigration, healthcare, labor, infrastructure and energy.
in addition, upon the realization of a profitable investment by any of our carry funds and prior to our receiving any performance allocations in respect of that investment, 100% of the proceeds of that investment must generally be paid to the investors in that carry fund until they have recovered certain fees and expenses and achieved a certain return on all realized investments by that carry fund as well as a recovery of any unrealized losses. if we were to have a realization event in a particular quarter, it may have a significant impact on our results for that particular quarter which may not be replicated in subsequent quarters. we recognize revenue on investments in our investment funds based on our allocable share of realized and unrealized gains (or losses) reported by such investment funds, and a decline in realized or unrealized gains, or an increase in realized or unrealized losses, would adversely affect our revenue and possibly cash flow, which could further increase the volatility of our quarterly results. because our carry funds have preferred return thresholds to investors that need to be met prior to our receiving any performance allocations, substantial declines in the carrying value of the investment portfolios of a carry fund can significantly delay or eliminate any performance allocations paid to us in respect of that fund since the value of the assets in the fund would need to recover to their aggregate cost basis plus the preferred return over time before we would be entitled to receive any performance allocations from that fund.
the timing and receipt of performance allocations also varies with the life cycle of our carry funds. during periods in which a relatively large portion of our assets under management is attributable to carry funds and investments in their "harvesting" period, our carry funds would make larger distributions than in the fundraising or investment periods that precede harvesting. during periods in which a significant portion of our assets under management is attributable to carry funds that are not in their harvesting periods, we may receive substantially lower performance allocations.
with respect to most of our funds of hedge funds, core+ real estate funds, infrastructure funds and credit-focused and real estate debt funds structured like hedge funds, our incentive income is paid between semi-annually and every five years, and the varying frequency of these payments will contribute to the volatility of our cash flow. furthermore, we earn this incentive income only if the net asset value of a fund has increased or, in the case of certain funds, increased beyond a particular return threshold. certain of these funds also have "high water marks" whereby we do not earn incentive income during a particular period even though the fund had positive returns in such period as a result of losses in prior periods. if one of these funds experiences losses, we will not be able to earn incentive income from the fund until it surpasses the previous high water mark. the incentive income we earn is therefore dependent on the net asset value of the fund, which could lead to significant volatility in our results.
adverse economic and market conditions may adversely affect the amount of cash generated by our businesses, and in turn, our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.
we use cash to (a) provide capital to facilitate the growth of our existing businesses, which principally includes funding our general partner and co-investment commitments to our funds, (b) provide capital for business expansion, (c) pay operating expenses and other obligations as they arise, including servicing our debt and (d) pay dividends to our shareholders and make distributions to the holders of blackstone holdings partnership units. our principal sources of cash are: (a) cash we received in connection with our prior bond offerings, (b) fee related earnings and (c) net realizations, which is the sum of realized principal investment income and realized performance revenues less realized performance compensation. we have also entered into a $1.6 billion revolving credit facility with a final maturity date of september 21, 2023. our long-term debt totaled $4.7 billion in borrowings from our prior bond issuances and we had no borrowings outstanding against our revolving credit facility as of december 31, 2019. as of december 31, 2019, we had $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $2.4 billion invested in our corporate treasury investments.
if the global economy and conditions in the financing markets worsen, our fund investment performance could suffer, resulting in, for example, the payment of less or no performance allocations to us. this could materially and adversely affect the amount of cash we have on hand, including for, among other purposes, the payment of dividends to our shareholders. having less cash on hand could in turn require us to rely on other sources of cash (such as the capital markets, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms) for the above purposes. furthermore, during adverse economic and market conditions, we might not be able to renew all or part of our existing revolving credit facility or find alternate financing on commercially reasonable terms. as a result, our uses of cash may exceed our sources of cash, thereby potentially affecting our liquidity position.
we depend on our founder and other key senior managing directors and the loss of their services would have a material adverse effect on our business, results and financial condition.
we depend on the efforts, skill, reputations and business contacts of our founder, stephen a. schwarzman, and other key senior managing directors, the information and deal flow they generate during the normal course of their activities and the synergies among the diverse fields of expertise and knowledge held by our professionals. accordingly, our success will depend on the continued service of these individuals, who are not obligated to remain employed with us. several key senior managing directors have left the firm in the past and others may do so in the future, and we cannot predict the impact that the departure of any key senior managing director will have on our ability to achieve our investment objectives. for example, the governing agreements of many of our funds generally provide investors with the ability to terminate the investment period in the event that certain "key persons" in the fund do not provide the specified time commitment to the fund or our firm ceases to control the general partner. the loss of the services of any key senior managing directors could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, net income and cash flows and could harm our ability to maintain or grow assets under management in existing funds or raise additional funds in the future. we have historically relied in part on the interests of these professionals in the investment funds' carried interest and incentive fees to discourage them from leaving the firm. however, to the extent our investment funds perform poorly, thereby reducing the potential for carried interest and incentive fees, their interests in carried interest and incentive fees become less valuable to them and become less effective as incentives for them to continue to be employed at blackstone.
our senior managing directors and other key personnel possess substantial experience and expertise and have strong business relationships with investors in our funds, clients and other members of the business community. as a result, the loss of these personnel could jeopardize our relationships with investors in our funds, our clients and members of the business community and result in the reduction of assets under management or fewer investment opportunities.
our publicly traded structure may adversely affect our ability to retain and motivate our senior managing directors and other key personnel and to recruit, retain and motivate new senior managing directors and other key personnel, both of which could adversely affect our business, results and financial condition.
our most important asset is our people, and our continued success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our senior managing directors and other professionals. our future success and growth depends to a substantial degree on our ability to retain and motivate our senior managing directors and other key personnel and to strategically recruit, retain and motivate new talented personnel. most of our current senior managing directors and other senior personnel have equity interests in our business that are primarily partnership units in blackstone holdings (as defined under "part iii. item 13. certain relationships and related transactions, and director independence - blackstone holdings partnership agreements") and which entitle such personnel to cash distributions. however, the value of blackstone holdings partnership units and other blackstone equity interests, and the distributions in respect thereof, may not be sufficient to retain and motivate our senior managing directors and other key personnel, nor may they be sufficiently attractive to strategically recruit, retain and motivate new talented personnel.
additionally, the retention of an increasingly larger portion of the blackstone holdings partnership units held by senior managing directors is not dependent upon their continued employment with us as those equity interests continue to vest as time passes. moreover, the minimum retained ownership requirements and transfer restrictions to which these interests are subject in certain instances lapse over time, may not be enforceable in all cases and can be waived. there is no guarantee that the non-competition  and non-solicitation agreements to which our senior managing directors are subject, together with our other arrangements with them, will prevent them from leaving us, joining our competitors or otherwise competing with us or that these agreements will be enforceable in all cases. in addition, these agreements will expire after a certain period of time, at which point each of our senior managing directors would be free to compete against us and solicit investors in our funds, clients and employees.
we might not be able to provide future senior managing directors with equity interests in our business to the same extent or with the same tax consequences from which our existing senior managing directors previously benefited. for example, the tax reform bill (as defined below) now imposes a longer three-year holding period requirement for carried interest to be treated as long-term capital gain. the longer holding period requirement may result in some of our carried interest being treated as ordinary income, which would materially increase the amount of taxes that our employees and other key personnel would be required to pay. in addition, following the tax reform bill, the tax treatment of carried interest may continue to be an area of focus for policymakers and government officials, which could result in further regulatory action by federal or state governments. for example, certain states, including new york and california, have proposed legislation to levy additional state tax on carried interest. similarly, there have been changes in the united kingdom with respect to taxation of carried interest, including the treatment of certain carried interest returns as income, which became effective from april 6, 2016. this change to the treatment of carried interest under the tax reform bill, along with other potential changes in applicable federal, state, local and other tax laws that may be enacted, may adversely affect our ability to recruit, retain and motivate our current and future professionals.
alternatively, the value of the equity awards we may issue senior managing directors at any given time may subsequently fall (as reflected in the market price of class a common stock), which could counteract the incentives we are seeking to induce in them. therefore, in order to recruit and retain existing and future senior managing directors, we may need to increase the level of compensation that we pay to them. accordingly, as we promote or hire new senior managing directors over time, we may increase the level of compensation we pay to our senior managing directors, which would cause our total employee compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of our total revenue to increase and adversely affect our profitability. in addition, issuance of equity interests in our business in the future to senior managing directors and other personnel would dilute public class a shareholders.
we strive to maintain a work environment that reinforces our culture of collaboration, motivation and alignment of interests with investors. if we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our changing enterprise and maintain this culture, our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
the asset management business is intensely competitive.
the asset management business is intensely competitive, with competition based on a variety of factors, including investment performance, the quality of service provided to clients, investor liquidity and willingness to invest, fund terms (including fees), brand recognition and business reputation. our asset management business competes with a number of private equity funds, specialized investment funds, hedge funds, funds of hedge funds and other sponsors managing pools of capital, as well as corporate buyers, traditional asset managers, commercial banks, investment banks and other financial institutions (including sovereign wealth funds), and we expect that competition will continue to increase. for example, certain traditional asset managers have developed their own private equity platforms and are marketing other asset allocation strategies as alternatives to hedge fund investments. additionally, developments in financial technology, or fintech, such as distributed ledger technology, or blockchain, have the potential to disrupt the financial industry and change the way financial institutions, as well as asset managers, do business. a number of factors serve to increase our competitive risks:
•   a number of our competitors in some of our businesses have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and more personnel than we do,
•   some of our funds may not perform as well as competitors' funds or other available investment products,
•   several of our competitors have significant amounts of capital, and many of them have similar investment objectives to ours, which may create additional competition for investment opportunities and may reduce the size and duration of pricing inefficiencies that many alternative investment strategies seek to exploit,
•   some of our competitors, particularly strategic competitors, may have a lower cost of capital, which may be exacerbated to the extent potential changes to the internal revenue code limit the deductibility of interest expense,
•   some of our competitors may have access to funding sources that are not available to us, which may create competitive disadvantages for us with respect to investment opportunities,
•   some of our competitors may be subject to less regulation and accordingly may have more flexibility to undertake and execute certain businesses or investments than we can and/or bear less compliance expense than we do,
•   some of our competitors may have more flexibility than us in raising certain types of investment funds under the investment management contracts they have negotiated with their investors,
•   some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances, different risk assessments or lower return thresholds, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and to bid more aggressively than us for investments that we want to make,
•   some of our competitors may be more successful than us in the development and implementation of new technology to address investor demand for product and strategy innovation, particularly in the hedge fund industry,
•   there are relatively few barriers to entry impeding new alternative asset fund management firms, and the successful efforts of new entrants into our various businesses, including former "star" portfolio managers at large diversified financial institutions as well as such institutions themselves, is expected to continue to result in increased competition,
•   some of our competitors may have better expertise or be regarded by investors as having better expertise in a specific asset class or geographic region than we do,
•   our competitors that are corporate buyers may be able to achieve synergistic cost savings in respect of an investment, which may provide them with a competitive advantage in bidding for an investment,
•   some investors may prefer to invest with an investment manager that is not publicly traded or is smaller with only one or two investment products that it manages, and
•   other industry participants will from time to time seek to recruit our investment professionals and other employees away from us.
we may lose investment opportunities in the future if we do not match investment prices, structures and terms offered by competitors. alternatively, we may experience decreased rates of return and increased risks of loss if we match investment prices, structures and terms offered by competitors. moreover, if we are forced to compete with other alternative asset managers on the basis of price, we may not be able to maintain our current fund fee and carried interest terms. we have historically competed primarily on the performance of our funds, and not on the level of our fees or carried interest relative to those of our competitors. however, there is a risk that fees and carried interest in the alternative investment management industry will decline, without regard to the historical performance of a manager. fee or carried interest income reductions on existing or future funds, without corresponding decreases in our cost structure, would adversely affect our revenues and profitability.
in addition, the attractiveness of our investment funds relative to investments in other investment products could decrease depending on economic conditions. furthermore, any deregulatory measures for the u.s. financial services industry undertaken by the u.s. congress or the trump administration may create additional competition for many of our funds. see "- financial deregulation measures proposed and enacted by the trump administration, members of the u.s. congress and regulatory agencies, may create regulatory uncertainty for the financial sector, increase competition in certain of our investment strategies and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations."
this competitive pressure could adversely affect our ability to make successful investments and limit our ability to raise future investment funds, either of which would adversely impact our business, revenue, results of operations and cash flow.
our organizational documents do not limit our ability to enter into new lines of businesses, and we may expand into new investment strategies, geographic markets and businesses, each of which may result in additional risks and uncertainties in our businesses.
our plan, to the extent that market conditions permit, is to continue to grow our investment businesses and expand into new investment strategies, geographic markets and businesses. our organizational documents do not limit us to investment management businesses. accordingly, we have pursued and may continue to pursue growth through acquisitions of asset managers and other investment management companies, acquisitions of critical business partners, or other strategic initiatives. to the extent we make strategic investments or acquisitions, undertake other strategic initiatives or enter into a new line of business, we will face numerous risks and uncertainties, including risks associated with (a) the required investment of capital and other resources, (b) the possibility that we have insufficient expertise to engage in such activities profitably or without incurring inappropriate amounts of risk, (c) the diversion of management's attention from our core businesses, (d) assumption of liabilities in any acquired business, (e) the disruption of our ongoing businesses, (f) the increasing demands on or issues related to the combining or integrating operational and management systems and controls, (g) compliance with additional regulatory requirements and (h) the broadening of our geographic footprint, including the risks associated with conducting operations in non-u.s. jurisdictions.
entry into certain lines of business may subject us to new laws and regulations with which we are not familiar, or from which we are currently exempt, and may lead to increased litigation and regulatory risk. for example, we have increasingly undertaken business initiatives to offer registered investment products to retail investors. these activities have and will continue to impose additional compliance burdens on us and could also subject us to enhanced regulatory scrutiny and expose us to greater reputation and litigation risk. see "- we have increasingly undertaken business initiatives to increase the number and type of investment products we offer to retail investors, which could expose us to new and greater levels of risk." in addition, if a new business generates insufficient revenues or if we are unable to efficiently manage our expanded operations, our results of operations will be adversely affected. our strategic initiatives may include, among other things, initiatives seeking to expand our and our portfolio companies' data science capabilities, which require a robust legal and compliance framework, and entry into joint ventures, which may require us to be dependent on, and subject us to liability, losses or reputational damage relating to, systems, controls and personnel that are not under our control.
if we are unable to consummate or successfully integrate additional development opportunities, acquisitions or joint ventures, we may not be able to implement our growth strategy successfully.
our growth strategy is based, in part, on the selective development or acquisition of asset management businesses or other businesses complementary to our business where we think we can add substantial value or generate substantial returns. the success of this strategy will depend on, among other things: (a) the availability of suitable opportunities, (b) the level of competition from other companies that may have greater financial resources, (c) our ability to value potential development or acquisition opportunities accurately and negotiate acceptable terms for those opportunities, (d) our ability to obtain requisite approvals and licenses from the relevant governmental authorities and to comply with applicable laws and regulations without incurring undue costs and delays and (e) our ability to identify and enter into mutually beneficial relationships with venture partners. moreover, even if we are able to identify and successfully complete an acquisition, we may encounter unexpected difficulties or incur unexpected costs associated with integrating and overseeing the operations of the new businesses. if we are not successful in implementing our growth strategy, our business, financial results and the market price for our class a common stock may be adversely affected.
the spin-off of our financial and strategic advisory services, restructuring and reorganization advisory services, and park hill fund placement businesses could result in substantial tax liability for us.
on october 1, 2015, we completed the previously announced spin-off of our financial and strategic advisory services, restructuring and reorganization advisory services, and park hill fund placement businesses and combined these businesses with pjt partners, an independent financial advisory firm founded by paul j. taubman, to form an independent publicly traded company. we may be responsible for u.s. federal income tax liabilities that relate to the spin-off if certain internal reorganization transactions in connection with the spin-off fail to qualify as tax-free.
changes in relevant tax laws, regulations or treaties or an adverse interpretation of these items by tax authorities could adversely impact our effective tax rate and tax liability.
our effective tax rate and tax liability is based on the application of current income tax laws, regulations and treaties. these laws, regulations and treaties are complex, and the manner which they apply to us and our funds is sometimes open to interpretation. significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. although management believes its application of current laws, regulations and treaties to be correct and sustainable upon examination by the tax authorities, the tax authorities could challenge our interpretation resulting in additional tax liability or adjustment to our income tax provision that could increase our effective tax rate. regarding the impact of the conversion on our income taxes, see "part ii. item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - note 15. income taxes."
comprehensive u.s. federal income tax reform became effective in 2018, which could adversely affect us.
u.s. federal income tax reform legislation known as the tax cuts and jobs act, which was signed into law on december 22, 2017 (the "tax reform bill") has resulted in fundamental changes to the internal revenue code. changes to u.s. tax laws resulting from the tax reform bill, including reduction to the federal corporate income tax rate, a partial limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense, and a longer three-year holding period requirement for carried interest to be treated as long-term capital gain could have an adverse effect on our business operations and our funds' investment activities. these and other changes from the tax reform bill - including limitations on the use, carryback and carryforward of net operating losses and changes relating to the scope and timing of u.s. taxation on earnings from international business operations - could also have an adverse effect on us or our portfolio companies. the exact impact of the tax reform bill for future years is difficult to quantify, but these changes could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. in addition, other changes could be enacted in the future to increase the corporate tax rate, limit further the deductibility of interest, subject carried interest to more onerous taxation or effect other changes that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. such changes could also include tax laws enacted by state or local governments in response to the tax reform bill that could result in further changes to state and local taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations.
additional proposed changes in taxation of businesses could adversely affect us.
congress, the organization for economic co-operation and development ("oecd") and other government agencies in jurisdictions in which we and our affiliates invest or do business have maintained a focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational companies. the oecd, which represents a coalition of member countries, is contemplating changes to numerous long-standing tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting ("beps") project, which is focused on a number of issues, including the shifting of profits between affiliated entities in different tax jurisdictions, interest deductibility and eligibility for the benefits of double tax treaties. several of the proposed measures are potentially relevant to some of our structures and could have an adverse tax impact on our funds, investors and/or our portfolio companies. some member countries have been moving forward on the beps agenda but, because timing of implementation and the specific measures adopted will vary among participating states, significant uncertainty remains regarding the impact of beps proposals. if implemented, these proposals could result in a loss of tax treaty benefits and increased taxes on income from our investments.
a number of european jurisdictions have enacted taxes on financial transactions, and the european commission has proposed legislation to harmonize these taxes under the so-called "enhanced cooperation procedure," which provides for adoption of eu-level  legislation applicable to some but not all eu member states. these contemplated changes, if adopted by individual countries, could increase tax uncertainty and/or costs faced by us, our funds' portfolio companies and our investors, change our business model and cause other adverse consequences. the timing or impact of these proposals is unclear at this point. in addition, tax laws, regulations and interpretations are subject to continual changes, which could adversely affect our structures or returns to our investors. for instance, various countries have adopted or proposed tax legislation that may adversely affect portfolio companies and investment structures in countries in which our funds have invested and may limit the benefits of additional investments in those countries.
changes in u.s. and foreign tax law could adversely affect our ability to raise funds from certain foreign investors or increase our compliance or withholding tax costs.
under the u.s. foreign account tax compliance act ("fatca"), all entities in a broadly defined class of foreign financial institutions ("ffis") are required to comply with a complicated and expansive reporting regime or be subject to a 30% united states withholding tax on certain u.s. payments, and non-u.s. entities which are not ffis are required to either certify they have no substantial u.s. beneficial ownership or to report certain information with respect to their substantial u.s. beneficial ownership or be subject to a 30% u.s. withholding tax on certain u.s. payments. the reporting obligations imposed under fatca require ffis to enter into agreements with the irs to obtain and disclose information about certain investors to the irs. in addition, the administrative and economic costs of compliance with fatca may discourage some foreign investors from investing in u.s. funds, which could adversely affect our ability to raise funds from these investors. other countries such as luxembourg, the u.k. and the cayman islands have implemented regimes similar to that of fatca. for example, under an initiative known as global fatca, more than 100 oecd member countries have committed to automatic exchange of information relating to accounts held by tax residents of signatory countries, using a common reporting standard ("crs"). compliance with such regimes could result in increased administrative and compliance costs and could subject our investment entities to increased withholding taxes.
the u.k.'s withdrawal from the european union may negatively impact the value of certain of our assets.
on january 31, 2020, the u.k. withdrew from the european union ("brexit"), with a transition period lasting until december 31, 2020. during the transition period, existing arrangements between the u.k. and the eu will remain in place while the u.k. and the european union (the "eu") seek to negotiate a free trade agreement that will govern the trading relationship between the u.k. and the eu following the transition period.
there is ongoing uncertainty regarding the terms of a free trade agreement between the u.k. and the eu, including whether agreement will be reached by the end of the transition period. such agreement may include tariffs, a non-tariff barrier, customs checks, a limitation on the provision of cross-border services, changes in withholding taxes, restrictions on movement of employees and restrictions on the transfer of personal data, all of which could impact the attractiveness of the u.k. as a global business and financial center. although the long-term impact of such changes, and of brexit more broadly, is uncertain, brexit may have an adverse effect on the rate of economic growth in the u.k. and europe, which may negatively impact asset values in those regions. in addition, given the size and global significance of the u.k.'s economy, ongoing uncertainty regarding its political and economic relationships with europe may continue to be a source of instability in markets outside of the u.k. and europe.
in addition, since the result of the brexit referendum in mid-2016, the british pound has experienced periods of weakness. if the british pound experiences a decline as a result of brexit's effectiveness, the mark-to-market valuations of our british pound-denominated investments may be negatively impacted. weakness in the british pound may also contribute to volatility in other currencies, including the euro, which may negatively impact the mark-to-market valuations of our euro denominated investments. weakness or significant fluctuation in currency exchange rates may also adversely impact our financial results as a result of the conversion of investment principal and income from one currency into another.
cybersecurity risks could result in the loss of data, interruptions in our business, damage to our reputation, and subject us to regulatory actions, increased costs and financial losses, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
our operations are highly dependent on our information systems and technology and we rely heavily on our financial, accounting, communications and other data processing systems. our systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of tampering or a breach of our network security systems or otherwise. in addition, our systems face ongoing cybersecurity threats and attacks. attacks on our systems could involve, and in some instances have in the past involved, attempts intended to obtain unauthorized access to our proprietary information, destroy data or disable, degrade or sabotage our systems, or divert or otherwise steal funds, including through the introduction of computer viruses, "phishing" attempts and other forms of social engineering. cyberattacks and other security threats could originate from a wide variety of external sources, including cyber criminals, nation state hackers, hacktivists and other outside parties. cyberattacks and other security threats could also originate from the malicious or accidental acts of insiders, such as employees.
there has been an increase in the frequency and sophistication of the cyber and security threats we face, with attacks ranging from those common to businesses generally to those that are more advanced and persistent, which may target us because, as an alternative asset management firm, we hold a significant amount of confidential and sensitive information about our investors, our portfolio companies and potential investments. as a result, we may face a heightened risk of a security breach or disruption with respect to this information. there can be no assurance that measures we take to ensure the integrity of our systems will provide protection, especially because cyberattack techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until successful. if our systems are compromised, do not operate properly or are disabled, or we fail to provide the appropriate regulatory or other notifications in a timely manner, we could suffer financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to our investment funds and fund investors, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. the costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means.
in addition, we could also suffer losses in connection with updates to, or the failure to timely update, our information systems and technology. in addition, we have become increasingly reliant on third party service providers for certain aspects of our business, including for the administration of certain funds, as well as for certain information systems and technology, including cloud-based services. these third party service providers could also face ongoing cyber security threats and compromises of their systems and as a result, unauthorized individuals could gain, and in some past instances have gained, access to certain confidential data.
cybersecurity has become a top priority for regulators around the world. many jurisdictions in which we operate have laws and regulations relating to data privacy, cybersecurity and protection of personal information, including, as examples the general data protection regulation ("gdpr") in the european union and that went into effect in may 2018 and the california consumer privacy act ("ccpa"). see "- rapidly developing and changing global privacy laws and regulations could increase compliance costs and subject us to enforcements risks and reputational damage." some jurisdictions have also enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals and government agencies of data security breaches involving certain types of personal data.
breaches in security, whether malicious in nature or through inadvertent transmittal or other loss of data, could potentially jeopardize our, our employees' or our fund investors' or counterparties' confidential, proprietary and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, our employees', our fund investors', our counterparties' or third parties' business and operations, which could result in significant financial losses, increased costs, liability to our fund investors and other counterparties, regulatory intervention and reputational damage. furthermore, if we fail to comply with the relevant laws and regulations or fail to provide the appropriate regulatory or other notifications of breach in a timely matter, it could result in regulatory investigations and penalties, which could lead to negative publicity and reputational harm and may cause our fund investors and clients to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures.
our portfolio companies also rely on data processing systems and the secure processing, storage and transmission of information, including payment and health information. a disruption or compromise of these systems could have a material adverse effect on the value of these businesses. our funds may invest in strategic assets having a national or regional profile or in infrastructure, the nature of which could expose them to a greater risk of being subject to a terrorist attack or security breach than other assets or businesses. such an event may have material adverse consequences on our investment or assets of the same type or may require portfolio companies to increase preventative security measures or expand insurance coverage.
finally, our technology, data and intellectual property and the technology, data and intellectual property of our portfolio companies are also subject to a heightened risk of theft or compromise to the extent we and our portfolio companies engage in operations outside the united states, in particular in those jurisdictions that do not have comparable levels of protection of proprietary information and assets such as intellectual property, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how and customer information and records. in addition, we and our portfolio companies may be required to compromise protections or forego rights to technology, data and intellectual property in order to operate in or access markets in a foreign jurisdiction. any such direct or indirect compromise of these assets could have a material adverse impact on us and our portfolio companies.
rapidly developing and changing global privacy laws and regulations could increase compliance costs and subject us to enforcement risks and reputational damage.
we and our portfolio companies are subject to various risks and costs associated with the collection, processing, storage and transmission of personally identifiable information ("pii") and other sensitive and confidential information. this data is wide ranging and relates to our investors, employees, contractors and other counterparties and third parties. our compliance obligations include those relating to u.s. laws such as the ccpa, which provides for enhanced consumer protections for california residents, a private right of action for data breaches and statutory fines and damages for data breaches or other ccpa violations, as well as well as a requirement of "reasonable" cybersecurity. our compliance obligations also include those relating to foreign data collection and privacy laws, including, for example, the gdpr in europe, the japanese personal information protection act, the hong kong personal data (privacy) ordinance, the australian privacy act and the brazilian bank secrecy law. global laws in this area are rapidly increasing in the scale and depth of their requirements, and are also often extra-territorial in nature. in addition, a wide range of regulators are seeking to enforce these laws across regions and borders. furthermore, we frequently have privacy compliance requirements as a result of our contractual obligations with counterparties. these legal and contractual obligations heighten our privacy obligations in the ordinary course of conducting our business in the u.s. and internationally.
while we have taken various measures and made significant efforts and investment to ensure that our policies, processes and systems are both robust and compliance with these obligations, our potential liability remains, particularly given the continued and rapid development of privacy laws and regulations around the world, and increased enforcement action. any inability, or perceived inability, by us or our portfolio companies to adequately address privacy concerns, or comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards and guidance, contractual obligations, or other legal obligations, even if unfounded, could result in significant regulatory and third-party liability, increased costs, disruption of our and our portfolio companies' business and operations, and a loss of client (including investor) confidence and other reputational damage. furthermore, as new privacy-related laws and regulations are implemented, the time and resources needed for us and our portfolio companies to comply with such laws and regulations continues to increase and become a significant compliance workstream.
our operations are highly dependent on the information system and technology infrastructure that supports our business.
we depend on our headquarters in new york city, where many of our personnel are located, for the continued operation of our business. a disaster or a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses, as a result of a cybersecurity incident or otherwise, including a disruption involving electronic communications or other services used by us or third parties with whom we conduct business, or directly affecting our headquarters, could have a material adverse impact on our ability to continue to operate our business without interruption. our disaster recovery and business continuity programs may not be sufficient to mitigate the harm that may result from such a disaster or disruption. in addition, insurance and other safeguards might only partially reimburse us for our losses, if at all.
our operations are highly dependent on our information systems and technology and we rely heavily on our financial, accounting, communications and other data processing systems, each of which may require update and enhancement as we grow our business. our information systems and technology may not continue to be able to accommodate our growth, and the cost of maintaining such systems may increase from its current level. such a failure to adapt to or accommodate growth, or an increase in costs related to such information systems, could have a material adverse effect on us.
in addition, we have become increasingly reliant on third party service providers for certain aspects of our business, including for the administration of certain funds, as well as for certain information systems and technology, including cloud-based services. in addition to the fact that these third party service providers could also face ongoing cyber security threats and compromises of their systems, we generally have less control over the delivery of such third-party services, and as a result, we may face disruptions to our ability to operate a business as a result of interruptions of such services. any interruption or deterioration in the performance of these third parties or failures or compromises of their information systems and technology could impair the operations of us and our funds and adversely affect our reputation and businesses. see "- cybersecurity risks could result in the loss of data, interruptions in our business, damage to our reputation, and subject us to regulatory actions, increased costs and financial losses, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations" and "- rapidly developing and changing global privacy laws and regulations could increase compliance costs and subject us to enforcement risks and reputational damage."
extensive regulation of our businesses affects our activities and creates the potential for significant liabilities and penalties. the possibility of increased regulatory focus could result in additional burdens on our business.
our business is subject to extensive regulation, including periodic examinations, by governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations in the jurisdictions in which we operate around the world. these authorities have regulatory powers dealing with many aspects of financial services, including the authority to grant, and in specific circumstances to cancel, permissions to carry on particular activities. many of these regulators, including u.s. and foreign government agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the united states, are also empowered to conduct investigations and administrative proceedings that can result in fines, suspensions of personnel, changes in policies, procedures or disclosure or other sanctions, including censure, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, the suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer or investment adviser from registration or memberships or the commencement of a civil or criminal lawsuit against us or our personnel. moreover, the financial services industry in recent years has been the subject of heightened scrutiny, and the sec has specifically focused on private equity. in that connection, in recent years the sec's stated examination priorities have included, among other things, private equity firms' collection of fees and allocation of expenses, their marketing and valuation practices, allocation of investment opportunities and policies and procedures with respect to conflicts of interest. we regularly are subject to requests for information and informal or formal investigations by the sec and other regulatory authorities, with which we routinely cooperate, and which have included review of historical practices that were previously examined. such investigations have previously and may in the future result in penalties and other sanctions. sec actions and initiatives can have an adverse effect on our financial results, including as a result of the imposition of a sanction, a limitation on our or our personnel's activities, or changing our historic practices. even if an investigation or proceeding did not result in a sanction or the sanction imposed against us or our personnel by a regulator were small in monetary amount, the adverse publicity relating to the investigation, proceeding or imposition of these sanctions could harm our reputation and cause us to lose existing clients or fail to gain new clients.
we rely on complex exemptions from statutes in conducting our asset management activities.
we regularly rely on exemptions from various requirements of the u.s. securities act of 1933, as amended, or "securities act," the exchange act, the 1940 act, the commodity exchange act and the u.s. employee retirement income security act of 1974, as amended, in conducting our asset management activities. these exemptions are sometimes highly complex and may in certain circumstances depend on compliance by third parties whom we do not control. if for any reason these exemptions were to become unavailable to us, we could become subject to regulatory action or third party claims and our business could be materially and adversely affected. for example, the "bad actor" disqualification provisions of rule 506 of regulation d under the securities act ban an issuer from offering or selling securities pursuant to the safe harbor rule in rule 506 if the issuer or any other "covered person" is the subject of a criminal, regulatory or court order or other "disqualifying event" under the rule which has not been waived. the definition of "covered person" includes an issuer's directors, general partners, managing members and executive officers; affiliates who are also issuing securities in the offering; beneficial owners of 20% or more of the issuer's outstanding equity securities; and promoters and persons compensated for soliciting investors in the offering. accordingly, our ability to rely on rule 506 to offer or sell securities would be impaired if we or any "covered person" is the subject of a disqualifying event under the rule and we are unable to obtain a waiver. the requirements imposed by our regulators are designed primarily to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect investors in our investment funds and are not designed to protect our class a common shareholders. consequently, these regulations often serve to limit our activities and impose burdensome compliance requirements.
financial regulatory changes in the united states could adversely affect our business.
the financial services industry is, and continues to be, the subject of heightened regulatory scrutiny in the united states. for example, the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act (the "dodd-frank act"), enacted in july 2010, imposed significant changes on almost every aspect of the u.s. financial services industry, including aspects of our business, which include, without limitation, credit risk retention rules for certain sponsors of asset-backed securities, strengthening the oversight and supervision of the otc derivatives and securities markets, as well as creating the financial stability oversight counsel ("fsoc"), an interagency body charged with identifying and monitoring systemic risk to financial markets.
rule 206(4)-5 under the advisers act prohibits investment advisers from providing advisory services for compensation to a government plan investor for two years, subject to limited exceptions, after the investment adviser, its senior executives or its personnel involved in soliciting investments from government entities make political contributions to certain candidates and officials in position to influence the hiring of an investment adviser by such government client. advisers are required to implement compliance policies designed, among other matters, to comply with this rule. any failure on our part to comply with the rule could expose us to significant penalties and reputational damage. in addition, there have been similar rules on a state level regarding "pay to play" practices by investment advisers.
on june 5, 2019, the sec adopted a package of rulemakings and interpretations that address the standards of conduct and disclosure obligations applicable to investment advisers and broker-dealers. among other things, the sec published an interpretation of the standard of conduct for investment advisers, and adopted "regulation best interest", which establishes a standard of conduct for broker-dealers and their associated persons. it is too early to predict all of the effects these rulemakings may have on our business. however, the new rules and processes related thereto may involve increased costs, including, but not limited to, compliance costs. in addition, several states have taken actions to potentially introduce new conduct standards for investment advisers and broker-dealers, operating in these states. while these state conduct standards are not finalized, any such proposed state laws or regulations may result in additional requirements related to our business. further, the u.s. department of labor ("dol") has indicated it may promulgate a new investment advice fiduciary rule under erisa. at this point, however, how any new dol fiduciary rule will work in conjunction with the rulemakings adopted by the sec or those proposed by the states is unclear. depending on how regulation best interest and the associated rulemakings are implemented and whether the dol or the various states adopt any additional rules governing the conduct of investment advisers and broker-dealers, any such rule or regulation could have an adverse effect on the distribution of our products to certain investors.
any changes in the regulatory framework applicable to our business, including the changes described above, may impose additional compliance and other costs, increase regulatory investigations of the investment activities of our funds, require the attention of our senior management, affect the manner in which we conduct our business and adversely affect our profitability. the full extent of the impact on us of the dodd-frank act or any other new laws, regulations or initiatives that may be proposed, including by the trump administration, which has expressed support for, and proposed, potential modifications to the dodd-frank act and other deregulatory measures, is impossible to determine.
financial deregulation measures proposed and enacted by the trump administration, members of the u.s. congress and regulatory agencies may create regulatory uncertainty for the financial sector, increase competition in certain of our investment strategies and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
on may 24, 2018, the economic growth, regulatory relief and consumer protection act (the "reform act") was signed into law. among other financial regulatory changes, the reform act amends various sections of the dodd-frank act, including by modifying the volcker rule to exempt certain insured depository institutions. in 2019, u.s. federal regulatory agencies adopted (a) amendments to the volcker rule regulations to implement the volcker rule amendments included in the reform act (b) certain targeted amendments to the volcker rule regulations to simplify and tailor certain compliance requirements relating to the volcker rule. in january 2020, the u.s. federal regulatory agencies proposed additional revisions to the volcker rule's current restrictions on banking entities sponsoring and investing in certain covered hedge funds and private equity funds, including by proposing new exemptions allowing banking entities to sponsor and invest without limit in credit funds, venture capital funds, customer facilitation funds and family wealth management vehicles. the proposal would also loosen certain other restrictions on extraterritorial fund activities and direct parallel or co-investments made alongside covered funds. the proposed revisions have not yet been adopted and are subject to change, but if adopted, the proposal would expand the ability of banking entities to invest in and sponsor private funds. this proposal, the reform act and such regulatory developments and various other proposals focused on deregulation of the u.s. financial services industry may have the effect of increasing competition for our businesses. for example, increased competition from banks and other financial institutions in the credit markets could have the effect of reducing credit spreads, which may adversely affect the revenues of our credit and other businesses whose strategies include the provision of credit to borrowers.
whether any particular other legislative or regulatory proposals will be enacted or adopted remains unclear. in addition, a determination as to the full extent of any impact on us or any of the portfolio companies of our funds of any such potential financial reform legislation, or whether any such proposal will become law, is not possible to determine. any changes in the regulatory framework applicable to our business or the businesses of the portfolio companies of our funds, including the changes described above, may impose additional costs, require the attention of our senior management or result in limitations on the manner in which business is conducted, or may ultimately have an adverse impact on the competitiveness of certain non-bank financial service providers vis-à-vis traditional banking organizations.
the potential for further governmental policy and/or legislative changes and regulatory reform creates uncertainty for our investment strategies, may make it more difficult to operate our business, and may adversely affect the profitability of our funds' portfolio companies.
governmental policy and/or legislative changes and regulatory reform could have a material impact on the investment strategies of our funds, and a prolonged environment of regulatory uncertainty may make the identification of attractive investment opportunities and the deployment of capital more challenging. further, governmental policy and/or legislative changes and regulatory reform could make it more difficult for us to operate our business, including by impeding fundraising, making certain investments or investment strategies unattractive or less profitable. in addition, our ability to identify business and other risks associated with new investments depends in part on our ability to anticipate and accurately assess regulatory, legislative and other changes that may have a material impact on the businesses in which we choose to invest. the failure to accurately anticipate the possible outcome of such changes and/or reforms could have a material adverse effect on the returns generated from our funds' investments and our revenues.
since 2018, the u.s. has imposed various tariffs on chinese goods, including aluminum and steels, and china has retaliated by placing tariffs on various u.s. goods. while both countries signed a preliminary trade agreement in january 2020 halting further tariffs and increasing sales of u.s. goods to china, the agreement leaves in place most tariffs on chinese goods. the final outcome of the negotiations and agreements is not possible to predict. further escalation of the "trade war" between the u.s. and china, or the countries' inability to reach further trade agreements, may negatively impact the rate of global growth, particularly in china, which has and continues to exhibit signs of slowing growth. such slowing growth could adversely affect the revenues and profitability of our funds' portfolio companies.
further governmental actions related to the imposition of tariffs or other trade barriers or changes to international trade agreements or policies, could further increase costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of products and services offered by current and future portfolio companies and adversely affect the revenues and profitability of companies whose businesses rely on goods imported from outside of the u.s.
president trump has also advocated for greater restrictions on international trade generally and has expressed antipathy toward certain international trade agreements and organizations, including the north american free trade agreement ("nafta") and the world trade organization (the "wto"). in december 2019, the u.s., mexico and canada signed the amended united states-mexico-canada agreement (the "usmca"), which, once ratified by all three countries, will replace nafta. the impact that the usmca will have on us and our portfolio companies is difficult to predict. if the u.s. were to withdraw from or materially modify any other international trade agreements to which it is a party, or if the u.s. were to withdraw from trade organizations such as the wto, certain foreign-sourced goods that are sold or purchased by our portfolio companies may no longer be available at commercially attractive prices or at all, which in turn could adversely affect the revenues and profitability of such companies.
further, the trump administration has outlined governmental policy changes and/or regulatory reform in multiple other areas, including tax, immigration, healthcare, labor, infrastructure and energy. while there is currently a substantial lack of clarity around the likelihood, timing and details of many such potential changes, such changes may adversely affect the companies in which we have invested or choose to invest in the future in a number of ways, including, without limitation:
•   immigration reform has been a continued area of focus for the trump administration. although the details and timing of potential changes to immigration law are difficult to predict, restrictions on the ability of individuals from certain countries to obtain non-immigrant visas or limitations on the number of individuals eligible for u.s. work visas may make it more difficult for current and future portfolio companies to recruit and retain skilled foreign workers and may increase labor and compliance costs.
•   effective for months beginning after december 31, 2018, the tax reform bill provides for the repeal of the provision of the patient protection and affordable care act ("aca"), which requires certain individuals without minimum health coverage to pay a penalty. this repeal and other measures being pursued by the trump administration could result in an increase in the size of the uninsured population or a reduction in funds presently available to patients as a result of the repeal of this provision or the potential repeal of other significant portions of the aca could adversely affect multiple businesses in the healthcare industry, including pharmaceutical companies that benefit from purchases by individuals covered by government-subsidized insurance, hospitals that may be required to increase write-offs for bad debt resulting from the inability of insured patients to pay for care and insurance companies that have developed effective plans for participating in healthcare exchanges. further, one court has ruled that the aca is unconstitutional, but stayed that decision pending resolution of an appeal. if that decision is not reversed on appeal, that could exacerbate the types of adverse developments that are described above.
although there is a substantial lack of clarity regarding the likelihood, timing and details of any such potential changes or reforms, such changes or reforms may impose additional costs on the companies in which we have invested or choose to invest in the future, require the attention of senior management or result in limitations on the manner in which the companies in which we have invested or choose to invest in the future conduct business.
in july 2019, proposed legislation was introduced into the u.s. congress that contains a number of provisions that, if they were to become law, would adversely impact alternative asset management firms. among other things, the bill would: potentially expose private funds and certain holders of economic interests therein to the liabilities of portfolio companies; require private funds to offer identical terms and benefits to all limited partners; require disclosure of names of each limited partner invested in a private fund, as well as sensitive fund-and portfolio company-level information; impose a limitation on the deductibility of interest expense only applicable to companies owned by private funds; modify settled bankruptcy law to target transactions by private equity funds; increase tax rates on carried interest; and prohibit portfolio companies from paying dividends or repurchasing their shares during the first two years following the acquisition of the portfolio company. if the proposed bill, or other similar legislation, were to become law, it would adversely affect us, our portfolio companies and our investors.
we and our affiliates from time to time are required to report specified dealings or transactions involving iran or other sanctioned individuals or entities.
the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 ("itra") expands the scope of u.s. sanctions against iran. additionally, section 219 of the itra amended the exchange act to require companies subject to sec reporting obligations under section 13 of the exchange act to disclose in their periodic reports specified dealings or transactions involving iran or other individuals and entities targeted by certain ofac sanctions engaged in by the reporting company or any of its affiliates during the period covered by the relevant periodic report. in some cases, itra requires companies to disclose these types of transactions even if they were permissible under u.s. law. companies that currently may be or may have been at the time considered our affiliates have from time to time publicly filed and/or provided to us the disclosures reproduced on exhibit 99.1 of our quarterly reports. we do not independently verify or participate in the preparation of these disclosures. we are required to separately file with the sec a notice when such activities have been disclosed in this report, and the sec is required to post such notice of disclosure on its website and send the report to the president and certain u.s. congressional committees. the president thereafter is required to initiate an investigation and, within 180 days of initiating such an investigation, determine whether sanctions should be imposed. disclosure of such activity, even if such activity is not subject to sanctions under applicable law, and any sanctions actually imposed on us or our affiliates as a result of these activities, could harm our reputation and have a negative impact on our business, and any failure to disclose any such activities as required could additionally result in fines or penalties.
we are subject to increasing scrutiny from certain investors with respect to the societal and environmental impact of investments made by our funds, which may constrain capital deployment opportunities for our funds and adversely impact our ability to raise capital from such investors.
in recent years, certain investors, including public pension funds, have placed increasing importance on the negative impacts of investments made by the private equity and other funds to which they commit capital, including with respect to environmental, social and governance ("esg") matters. certain investors have also demonstrated increased activism with respect to existing investments, including by urging asset managers to take certain actions that could adversely impact the value of an investment, or refrain from taking certain actions that could improve the value of an investment. at times, investors have conditioned future capital commitments on the taking or refraining from taking of such actions. increased focus and activism related to esg and similar matters may constrain our capital deployment opportunities, and the demands of certain investors, including public pension funds, may further limit the types of investments that are available to our funds. in addition, investors, including public pension funds, which represent a significant portion of our funds' investor bases, may decide to withdraw previously committed capital from our funds (where such withdrawal is permitted) or to not commit capital to future fundraises as a result of their assessment of our approach to and consideration of the social cost of investments made by our funds. to the extent our access to capital from investors, including public pension funds, is impaired, we may not be able to maintain or increase the size of our funds or raise sufficient capital for new funds, which may adversely impact our revenues.
in addition, esg matters have been the subject of increased focus by certain regulators in the eu. for example, the european commission has proposed legislative reforms, which include, without limitation: (a) regulation 2019/2088 regarding the introduction of transparency and disclosure obligations for investors, funds and asset managers in relation to esg factors, for which most rules are proposed to take effect beginning on march 10, 2021 and (b) a proposed regulation regarding the introduction of eu-wide  taxonomy of environmentally sustainable activities, which is proposed to take effect in a staggered approach beginning on december 31, 2021. as a result of these legislative initiatives, we may be required to provide additional disclosure to investors in our funds with respect to esg matters.
regulatory changes in jurisdictions outside the united states could adversely affect our business.
similar to the environment in the united states, the current environment in jurisdictions outside the united states in which we operate, in particular europe, has become subject to further regulation. governmental regulators and other authorities in europe have proposed or implemented a number of initiatives and additional rules and regulations that could adversely affect our business. increasingly, the rules and regulations in the financial sector in europe are becoming more prescriptive. rules and regulations in other jurisdictions are often informed by key features of u.s. and european rules and regulations and as a result, our businesses outside of the united states and europe, including across asia, may become subject to increased regulation in the future.
in europe, the aifmd, as transposed into national law within the member states of the european economic area ("eea"), was implemented in 2013 and established a new regulatory regime for alternative investment fund managers, including private equity and hedge fund managers. the aifmd regulates managers established in or with a registered office in the eea managing one or more alternative investments funds, but it also regulates non-eea based managers, such as our affiliates, when they seek to market alternative investment funds in the eea. we have had to comply with these and other requirements of the aifmd in order to market certain of our investment funds to professional investors in the eea, including compliance with prescribed pre-investment  disclosures, prescribed annual report disclosures, periodic reporting to regulators in respect of each fund marketed, and asset-stripping restrictions in relation to the acquisition of non-listed companies or issuers established in the eea (these restrictions prohibit certain distributions to shareholders for 24 months following closing of an acquisition).
our aifm in luxembourg and the european fund structures in respect of which it is the appointed investment manager, are subject to the full requirements of the aifmd, such as rules relating to, among other things, depositary oversight, remuneration, minimum regulatory capital requirements, restrictions on the use of leverage, requirements in relation to liquidity, risk management and valuation of assets. the establishment of a platform in the eea has increased the ongoing cost of administration and compliance with the aifmd, including costs and expenses of collecting and collating data of the eea funds and the preparation of regular reports to be filed with the regulator. the advantages of this structure potentially come at a cost of greater overall complexity, higher compliance and administration costs.
the eu securitization regulation (the "securitization regulation"), which became effective on january 1, 2019, repealed and replaced the securitization provisions in a range of sector-specific european union legislation, including the aifmd. the securitization regulation imposes due diligence and risk retention requirements on "institutional investors," which includes managers of alternative investment funds assets, and constrains the ability of alternative investment funds to invest in securitization positions that do not comply with the prescribed risk retention requirements. unlike the predecessor provisions, these requirements may apply not only to aifs managed by eu aifms but may also apply to aifs managed by non-eu aifms where those aifs have been registered for marketing in the eu under article 42 of the aifmd. consequently, the requirements apply to any blackstone managed investment funds that have been registered for marketing in the eu. given the expanded breadth of the revised regulation, this may impact or limit our funds' ability to make certain investments that constitute "securitizations" under the securitization regulation and may impose additional reporting obligations on securitizations, which may increase the costs of managing such vehicles. in addition, the existence of the requirement to "retain risk" limits the ability of the investment manager to market portions of the securitization to investors, which may result in less fee revenues to us.
the eu markets in financial instruments directive ii, as transposed into national law within the member states of the eu and the eu markets in financial instruments regulation (collectively, "mifid ii"), came into force on january 3, 2018 and overhauled and expanded the existing body of eu law regulating investment firms, which had been in effect since 2007. mifid ii requires, among other things, all mifid investment firms, including private equity and hedge fund managers, to comply with more prescriptive disclosure, transparency, reporting and recordkeeping obligations and enhanced obligations in relation to the receipt of investment research, best execution, product governance and marketing communications. as we operate investment firms which are subject to mifid, we have implemented revised policies and procedures to comply with mifid ii where relevant, including where certain rules have an extraterritorial impact on the firm. compliance with mifid ii has resulted in greater overall complexity, higher compliance and administration and operational costs and less overall flexibility.
as with any other organization that holds personal data of eu data subjects, we are required to comply with the gdpr because, among other things, we process european individuals' personal data in the u.s. via our global technology systems. financial regulators and data protection authorities throughout the eu have significantly increased audit and investigatory powers under gdpr to probe how personal data is being used and processed. penalties for non-compliance are material. serious breaches of gdpr include antitrust-like fines on companies of up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of global group turnover in the preceding year, regulatory action and reputational risk. see "- rapidly developing and changing global privacy laws and regulations could increase compliance costs and subject us to enforcement risks and reputational damage."
the fsb has taken on an increasingly important role in promoting the reform of international financial regulation through coordinating national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies in their development of regulatory, supervisory and financial sector policies. one of the risks identified by the fsb to the stability of the financial system is credit intermediation (involving maturity and liquidity transformation) and/or a build-up of leverage by non-bank entities - so-called "shadow banking."
the european banking authority ("eba") has issued guidelines which set appropriate aggregate limits to shadow banking entities when carrying out banking activities. while most alternative investment funds are excluded from the definition of "shadow banking entity," funds that use leverage on a substantial basis at fund level or have certain third party lending exposures are within the definition. when dealing with shadow banking entities, the eea financial institution would be required to implement additional effective processes (including with respect to due diligence) and set internal aggregate and individual limits to such exposures where they exceed 0.25% of the institution's eligible capital. while the guidelines do not themselves introduce a quantitative limit to institutions' exposures to shadow banking entities at the individual or aggregate exposure level, they place the responsibility on the banking sector to demonstrate that risks are managed effectively. affected institutions are required to set internal aggregate and individual limits to exposures to individual shadow banking entities which could limit or restrict the availability of credit and/or increase the cost of credit from these institutions for impacted funds.
our investment businesses are subject to the risk that similar measures might be introduced in other countries in which our funds currently have investments or plan to invest in the future, or that other legislative or regulatory measures that negatively affect their respective portfolio investments might be promulgated in any of the countries in which they invest. blackstone's non-u.s.  advisory entities are, to the extent required, registered with the relevant regulatory authority of the jurisdiction in which the advisory entity is domiciled. in addition, we voluntarily participate in several transparency initiatives, including those organized by the american investment council, the british private equity and venture capital association and others calling for the reporting of information concerning companies in which certain of our funds have investments. the reporting related to such initiatives may divert the attention of our personnel and the management teams of our funds' portfolio companies. moreover, sensitive business information relating to us or our funds' portfolio companies could be publicly released.
we are subject to substantial litigation risks and may face significant liabilities and damage to our professional reputation as a result of litigation allegations and negative publicity.
in recent years, the volume of claims and amount of damages claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against the financial services industry in general have been increasing. the investment decisions we make in our asset management business and the activities of our investment professionals on behalf of portfolio companies may subject the companies, funds and us to the risk of third party litigation arising from investor dissatisfaction with the performance of those investment funds, alleged conflicts of interest, the suitability or manner of distribution of our products, including to retail investors, the activities of our funds' portfolio companies and a variety of other litigation claims. from time to time we, our funds and our funds' public portfolio companies have been and may be subject to securities class action lawsuits by shareholders, as well as class action lawsuits that challenge our acquisition transactions and/or attempt to enjoin them. please see "item 3. legal proceedings" for a discussion of a certain proceeding to which we are currently a party.
in addition, to the extent investors in our investment funds suffer losses resulting from fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct or other similar misconduct, investors may have remedies against us, our investment funds, our senior managing directors or our affiliates under the federal securities law and/or state law. while the general partners and investment advisers to our investment funds, including their directors, officers, other employees and affiliates, are generally indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by law with respect to their conduct in connection with the management of the business and affairs of our investment funds, such indemnity does not extend to actions determined to have involved fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct or other similar misconduct.
the activities of our capital markets services business may also subject us to the risk of liabilities to our clients and third parties, including our clients' shareholders, under securities or other laws in connection with transactions in which we participate.
if any private lawsuits or regulatory actions were brought against us and resulted in a finding of substantial legal liability, it could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to us, which could seriously harm our business. we depend to a large extent on our business relationships and our reputation for integrity and high-caliber professional services to attract and retain investors and to pursue investment opportunities for our funds. as a result, allegations of improper conduct by private litigants, regulators, or employees, whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to us, as well as negative publicity and press speculation about us, our investment activities, our lines of business or distribution channels, our workplace environment, or the private equity industry in general, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation, which may be more damaging to our business than to other types of businesses.
employee misconduct could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain clients and subjecting us to significant legal liability and reputational harm. fraud and other deceptive practices or other misconduct at our funds' portfolio companies could similarly subject us to liability and reputational damage and also harm performance.
our employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. we are subject to a number of obligations and standards arising from our asset management business and our authority over the assets managed by our asset management business. the violation of these obligations and standards by any of our employees would adversely affect our clients and us. our business often requires that we deal with confidential matters of great significance to companies in which we may invest. if our employees were to improperly use or disclose confidential information, we could suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial position and current and future business relationships. detecting or deterring employee misconduct is not always possible, and the extensive precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases. if one of our employees were to engage in misconduct or were to be accused of such misconduct, our business and our reputation could be adversely affected.
in recent years, the u.s. department of justice and the sec have devoted greater resources to enforcement of the foreign corrupt practices act ("fcpa"). in addition, the u.k. has also significantly expanded the reach of its anti-bribery laws. local jurisdictions, such as brazil, have also brought a greater focus to anti-bribery laws. while we have developed and implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure strict compliance by us and our personnel with the fcpa, such policies and procedures may not be effective in all instances to prevent violations. any determination that we have violated the fcpa, the u.k. anti-bribery laws or other applicable anti-corruption laws could subject us to, among other things, civil and criminal penalties or material fines, profit disgorgement, injunctions on future conduct, securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence, any one of which could adversely affect our business prospects, financial position or the market value of our class a common stock.
in addition, we may also be adversely affected if there is misconduct by personnel of portfolio companies in which our funds invest. for example, financial fraud or other deceptive practices at our funds' portfolio companies, or failures by personnel at our funds' portfolio companies to comply with anti-bribery, trade sanctions, anti-harassment or other legal and regulatory requirements, could subject us to, among other things, civil and criminal penalties or material fines, profit disgorgement, injunctions on future conduct and securities litigation, and could also cause significant reputational and business harm to us. such misconduct may undermine our due diligence efforts with respect to such portfolio companies and could negatively affect the valuations of the investments by our funds in such portfolio companies. in addition, we may face an increased risk of such misconduct to the extent our investment in non-u.s. markets, particularly emerging markets, increases.
poor performance of our investment funds would cause a decline in our revenue, income and cash flow, may obligate us to repay performance allocations previously paid to us, and could adversely affect our ability to raise capital for future investment funds.
in the event that any of our investment funds were to perform poorly, our revenue, income and cash flow would decline because the value of our assets under management would decrease, which would result in a reduction in management fees, and our investment returns would decrease, resulting in a reduction in the performance allocations and incentive fees we earn. moreover, we could experience losses on our investments of our own principal as a result of poor investment performance by our investment funds. furthermore, if, as a result of poor performance of later investments in a carry fund's life, the fund does not achieve certain investment returns for the fund over its life, we will be obligated to repay the amount by which performance allocations that were previously distributed to us exceed the amount to which the relevant general partner is ultimately entitled.
poor performance of our investment funds could make it more difficult for us to raise new capital. investors in funds might decline to invest in future investment funds we raise and investors in hedge funds or other investment funds might withdraw their investments as a result of poor performance of the investment funds in which they are invested. investors and potential investors in our funds continually assess our investment funds' performance, and our ability to raise capital for existing and future investment funds and avoid excessive redemption levels will depend on our investment funds' continued satisfactory performance. accordingly, poor fund performance may deter future investment in our funds and thereby decrease the capital invested in our funds and ultimately, our management fee revenue. alternatively, in the face of poor fund performance, investors could demand lower fees or fee concessions for existing or future funds which would likewise decrease our revenue.
our asset management business depends in large part on our ability to raise capital from third party investors. a failure to raise capital from third party investors on attractive fee terms or at all, would impact our ability to collect management fees or deploy such capital into investments and potentially collect performance allocations, which would materially reduce our revenue and cash flow and adversely affect our financial condition.
our ability to raise capital from third party investors depends on a number of factors, including certain factors that are outside our control. certain factors, such as the performance of the stock market and the asset allocation rules or investment policies to which such third party investors are subject, could inhibit or restrict the ability of third party investors to make investments in our investment funds or the asset classes in which our investment funds invest. for example, state politicians and lawmakers in pennsylvania, new jersey and north carolina have taken steps or expressed intent to take steps to reduce or minimize the ability of their state pension funds to invest in alternative asset classes. the pennsylvania governor, for example, asked the state's two retirement funds to close out their private equity investments in favor of an all-index fund strategy, citing high fees paid to alternative asset managers, and in new jersey, new commitments by the state pension fund to private equity were frozen in 2018. there is no assurance that other states will not take similar actions, which may impair our access to capital from an investor base that has historically represented a significant portion of our fundraising. in addition, volatility in the valuations of investments, has in the past and may in the future affect our ability to raise capital from third party investors. to the extent periods of volatility are coupled with a lack of realizations from investors' existing private equity and real estate portfolios, such investors may be left with disproportionately outsized remaining commitments to a number of investment funds, which significantly limits such investors' ability to make new commitments to third party managed investment funds such as those managed by us.
our ability to raise new funds could similarly be hampered if the general appeal of private equity and other alternative investments were to decline. an investment in a limited partner interest in a private equity fund is more illiquid and the returns on such investment may be more volatile than an investment in securities for which there is a more active and transparent market. in periods of positive markets and low volatility, for example, investors may favor passive investment strategies such as index funds over our actively managed investment vehicles. alternative investments could also fall into disfavor as a result of concerns about liquidity and short-term performance. such concerns could be exhibited, in particular, by public pension funds, which have historically been among the largest investors in alternative assets. many public pension funds are significantly underfunded and their funding problems have been, and may in the future be, exacerbated by economic downturn. concerns with liquidity could cause such public pension funds to reevaluate the appropriateness of alternative investments. although a number of investors, including certain public pension funds, have increased their allocations to the alternative investments asset class in recent years, there is no assurance that this will continue or that our ability to raise capital from investors will not be hampered. in addition, our ability to raise capital from third parties outside of the u.s. could be limited to the extent other countries, such as china, impose restrictions or limitations on outbound foreign investment.
moreover, certain institutional investors are demonstrating a preference to in-source their own investment professionals and to make direct investments in alternative assets without the assistance of private equity advisers like us. such institutional investors may become our competitors and could cease to be our clients. as some existing investors cease or significantly curtail making commitments to alternative investment funds, we may need to identify and attract new investors in order to maintain or increase the size of our investment funds. there are no assurances that we can find or secure commitments from those new investors or that the fee terms of the commitments from such new investors will be consistent with the fees historically paid to us by our investors. if economic conditions were to deteriorate or if we are unable to find new investors, we might raise less than our desired amount for a given fund. further, as we seek to expand into other asset classes, we may be unable to raise a sufficient amount of capital to adequately support such businesses. a failure to successfully raise capital could materially reduce our revenue and cash flow and adversely affect our financial condition.
in connection with raising new funds or making further investments in existing funds, we negotiate terms for such funds and investments with existing and potential investors. the outcome of such negotiations could result in our agreement to terms that are materially less favorable to us than for prior funds we have managed or funds managed by our competitors, including with respect to management fees, incentive fees and/or carried interest, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues. such terms could also restrict our ability to raise investment funds with investment objectives or strategies that compete with existing funds, add additional expenses and obligations for us in managing the fund or increase our potential liabilities, all of which could ultimately reduce our revenues. in addition, certain institutional investors, including sovereign wealth funds and public pension funds, have demonstrated an increased preference for alternatives to the traditional investment fund structure, such as managed accounts, smaller funds and co-investment vehicles. there can be no assurance that such alternatives will be as profitable for us as the traditional investment fund structure, or as to the impact such a trend could have on the cost of our operations or profitability if we were to implement these alternative investment structures. in addition, certain institutional investors, including public pension funds, have publicly criticized certain fund fee and expense structures, including management fees and transaction and advisory fees. although we have no obligation to modify any of our fees with respect to our existing funds, we may experience pressure to do so in our funds. for example, we have confronted and expect to continue to confront requests from a variety of investors and groups representing investors to decrease fees, which could result in a reduction in the fees and performance allocations and incentive fees we earn.
certain policies and procedures implemented to mitigate potential conflicts of interest and address certain regulatory requirements may reduce the synergies across our various businesses.
because of our various lines of asset management businesses and our capital markets services business, we will be subject to a number of actual and potential conflicts of interest and subject to greater regulatory oversight and more legal and contractual restrictions than that to which we would otherwise be subject if we had just one line of business. to mitigate these conflicts and address regulatory, legal and contractual requirements across our various businesses, we have implemented certain policies and procedures (for example, information walls) that may reduce the positive synergies that we cultivate across these businesses for purposes of identifying and managing attractive investments. for example, we may come into possession of material non-public  information with respect to issuers in which we may be considering making an investment or issuers in which our affiliates may hold an interest. as a consequence of such policies and procedures, we may be precluded from providing such information or other ideas to our other businesses that might be of benefit to them.
our failure to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest in our investment business could damage our reputation and adversely affect our businesses.
as we have expanded and as we continue to expand the number and scope of our businesses, we increasingly confront potential conflicts of interest relating to our funds' investment activities. investment manager conflicts of interest continue to be a significant area of focus for regulators and the media. because of our size and the variety of businesses and investment strategies that we pursue, we may face a higher degree of scrutiny compared with investment managers that are smaller or focus on fewer asset classes. certain of our funds may have overlapping investment objectives, including funds that have different fee structures and/or investment strategies that are more narrowly focused, and potential conflicts may arise with respect to allocation of investment opportunities among those funds to the extent the fund documents do not mandate a specific investment allocation. for example, we may allocate an investment opportunity that is appropriate for two or more investment funds in a manner that excludes one or more funds or results in a disproportionate allocation based on factors or criteria that we determine, such as sourcing of the transaction, specific nature of the investment or size and type of the investment, among other factors. we may also decide to provide a co-investment opportunity to certain investors in lieu of allocating a piece of the investment to our funds. in addition, the challenge of allocating investment opportunities to certain funds may be exacerbated as we expand our business to include more lines of business, including more public vehicles. allocating investment opportunities appropriately frequently involves significant and subjective judgments. the risk that fund investors could challenge allocation decisions as inconsistent with our obligations under applicable law, governing fund agreements or our own policies cannot be eliminated. in addition, the perception of non-compliance with such requirements or policies could harm our reputation with fund investors.
we may also cause different funds to invest in a single portfolio company, for example where the fund that made an initial investment no longer has capital available to invest. we may also cause different funds that we manage to purchase different classes of securities in the same portfolio company. for example, one of our clo funds could acquire a debt security issued by the same company in which one of our private equity funds owns common equity securities. a direct conflict of interest could arise between the debt holders and the equity holders if such a company were to develop insolvency concerns, and we would have to carefully manage that conflict. a decision to acquire material non-public information about a company while pursuing an investment opportunity for a particular fund gives rise to a potential conflict of interest when it results in our having to restrict the ability of other funds to take any action. our affiliates may be service providers or counterparties to our funds or portfolio companies and receive fees or other compensation for services that are not shared with our fund investors. in such instances, we may be incentivized to cause our funds or portfolio companies to purchase such services from our affiliates rather than an unaffiliated service provider despite the fact that a third party service provider could potentially provide higher quality services or offer them at a lower cost. in addition, conflicts of interest may exist in the valuation of our investments and regarding decisions about the allocation of specific investment and co-investment opportunities among us, our funds and our affiliates, as well as the allocation of fees and expenses among us, our funds and their portfolio companies, and our affiliates. lastly, in certain, infrequent instances we may purchase an investment alongside one of our investment funds or sell an investment to one of our investment funds and conflicts may arise in respect of the allocation, pricing and timing of such investments and the ultimate disposition of such investments. a failure to appropriately deal with these, among other, conflicts, could negatively impact our reputation and ability to raise additional funds or result in potential litigation or regulatory action against us.
conflicts of interest may arise in our allocation of co-investment opportunities.
potential conflicts will arise with respect to our decisions regarding how to allocate co-investment opportunities among investors and the terms of any such co-investments. as a general matter, our allocation of co-investment opportunities is within our discretion and there can be no assurance that co-investment opportunities of any particular type or amount will become available to any of our investors. we may take into account a variety of factors and considerations we deem relevant in allocating co-investment  opportunities, including, without limitation, whether a potential co-investor has expressed an interest in evaluating co-investment  opportunities, our assessment of a potential co-investor's ability to invest an amount of capital that fits the needs of the investment and our assessment of a potential co-investor's ability to commit to a co-investment opportunity within the required timeframe of the particular transaction.
our fund documents typically do not mandate specific allocations with respect to co-investments. the investment advisers of our funds may have an incentive to provide potential co-investment opportunities to certain investors in lieu of others and/or in lieu of an allocation to our funds (including, for example, as part of an investor's overall strategic relationship with us) if such allocations are expected to generate relatively greater fees or performance allocations to us than would arise if such co-investment opportunities were allocated otherwise. co-investment arrangements may be structured through one or more of our investment vehicles, and in such circumstances co-investors will generally bear the costs and expenses thereof (which may lead to conflicts of interest regarding the allocation of costs and expenses between such co-investors and investors in our funds). the terms of any such existing and future co-investment vehicles may differ materially, and in some instances may be more favorable to us, than the terms of certain of our funds or prior co-investment vehicles, and such different terms may create an incentive for us to allocate a greater or lesser percentage of an investment opportunity to such co-investment vehicles. there can be no assurance that any conflicts of interest will be resolved in favor of any particular investment funds or investors (including any applicable co-investors).
we have increasingly undertaken business initiatives to increase the number and type of investment products we offer to retail investors, which could expose us to new and greater levels of risk.
although retail investors have been part of our historic distribution efforts, we have increasingly undertaken business initiatives to increase the number and type of investment products we offer to high net worth individuals, family offices and mass affluent investors. in some cases we seek to distribute our unregistered funds to such retail investors indirectly through feeder funds sponsored by brokerage firms, private banks or third party feeder providers, and in other cases directly to the qualified clients of private banks, independent investment advisors and brokers. in other cases we create registered investment products specifically designed for direct investment by retail investors, some of whom are not accredited investors. our initiatives to access retail investors entail the investment of resources and our objectives may not be fully realized.
moreover, accessing retail investors and selling retail directed products exposes us to new and greater levels of risk, including heightened litigation and regulatory enforcement risks. to the extent we distribute retail products through new channels, including through unaffiliated firms, we may not be able to effectively monitor or control the manner of their distribution, which could result in litigation against us, including with respect to, among other things, claims that products distributed through such channels are distributed to customers for whom they are unsuitable or distributed in any other inappropriate manner. although we seek to ensure through due diligence and onboarding procedures that the channels through which retail investors access our investment products conduct themselves responsibly, to the extent that our investment products are being distributed through third parties, we are exposed to reputational damage and possible legal liability to the extent such third parties improperly sell our products to investors. similarly, the hiring of employees to oversee independent advisors and brokers presents risks if they fail to follow training, review and supervisory procedures. in addition, the distribution of retail products through new channels whether directly or through market intermediaries could expose us to additional regulatory risk in the form of allegations of improper conduct and/or actions by state and federal regulators against us with respect to, among other things, product suitability, conflicts of interest and the adequacy of disclosure to customers to whom our products are distributed through those channels.
valuation methodologies for certain assets in our funds can be subject to significant subjectivity and the fair value of assets established pursuant to such methodologies may never be realized, which could result in significant losses for our funds and the reduction of performance revenues.
our investment funds make investments in illiquid investments or financial instruments for which there is little, if any, market activity. we determine the value of such investments and financial instruments on at least a quarterly basis based on the fair value of such investments. the fair value of such investments and financial instruments is generally determined using a primary methodology and corroborated by a secondary methodology. methodologies are used on a consistent basis and described in the investment funds' valuation policies.
the determination of fair value using these methodologies takes into consideration a range of factors including, but not limited to, the price at which the investment was acquired, the nature of the investment, local market conditions, trading values on public exchanges for comparable securities, current and projected operating performance and financing transactions subsequent to the acquisition of the investment. these valuation methodologies involve a significant degree of management judgment. for example, as to investments that we share with another sponsor, we may apply a different valuation methodology than the other sponsor does or derive a different value than the other sponsor has derived on the same investment. these differences might cause some investors to question our valuations. see "part ii. item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation - critical accounting policies" for an overview our fair value policy and the significant judgment required in the application thereof in the use of different underlying assumptions, estimates, methodologies and/or judgments in the determination of the value of certain investments and financial instruments could potentially produce materially different results.
because there is significant uncertainty in the valuation of, or in the stability of the value of illiquid investments, the fair values of such investments as reflected in an investment fund's net asset value do not necessarily reflect the prices that would actually be obtained by us on behalf of the investment fund when such investments are realized. realizations at values significantly lower than the values at which investments have been reflected in prior fund net asset values would result in reduced gains or losses for the applicable fund, a decline in certain asset management fees and the reduction in potential performance allocations and incentive fees. changes in values of investments from quarter to quarter may result in volatility in our investment funds' net asset value, our investment in , or fees from, those funds and the results of operations and cash flow that we report from period to period. further, a situation where asset values turn out to be materially different than values reflected in prior fund net asset values could cause investors to lose confidence in us, which would in turn result in difficulty in raising additional funds or redemptions from our hedge funds.
our use of borrowings to finance our business exposes us to risks.
we use borrowings to finance our business operations as a public company. we have numerous outstanding notes with various maturity dates as well as a revolving credit facility that matures on september 21, 2023. see "part ii. item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - liquidity and capital resources - sources and uses of liquidity" for further information regarding our outstanding borrowings. as borrowings under the credit facility and our outstanding notes mature, we will be required to refinance or repay such borrowings. in order to do so, we may enter into a new facility or issue new notes, each of which could result in higher borrowing costs. we may also issue equity, which would dilute existing shareholders. further, we may choose to repay such borrowings using cash on hand, cash provided by our continuing operations or cash from the sale of our assets, each of which could reduce the amount of cash available  to facilitate the growth and expansion of our businesses and pay dividends to our shareholders and operating expenses and other obligations as they arise. in order to obtain new borrowings, or to extend or refinance existing borrowings, we are dependent on the willingness and ability of financial institutions such as global banks to extend credit to us on favorable terms, and on our ability to access the debt and equity capital markets, which can be volatile. there is no guarantee that such financial institutions will continue to extend credit to us or that we will be able to access the capital markets to obtain new borrowings or refinance existing borrowings when they mature. in addition, the use of leverage to finance our business exposes us to the types of risk described in "- dependence on significant leverage in investments by our funds could adversely affect our ability to achieve attractive rates of return on those investments."
interest rates on our and our portfolio companies' outstanding financial instruments might be subject to change based on regulatory developments, which could adversely affect our revenue, expenses and the value of those financial instruments.
libor and certain other floating rate benchmark indices, including, without limitation, the euro interbank offered rate, tokyo interbank offered rate, hong kong interbank offered rate and singapore interbank offered rate (collectively, "ibors") are the subject of recent national, international and regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. these reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. on july 27, 2017, the fca, which regulates libor, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after 2021, but secured the voluntary agreement of the libor panel banks to continue to submit libor rates until that time. other jurisdictions have also indicated they will implement reforms or phase-outs, which are currently scheduled to take effect at the end of calendar year 2021. a transition away from the widespread use of the various ibors to alternative rates is expected to occur over the course of the next several years. however, there is a lack of clarity as to what methods of calculating a replacement benchmark will be established or adopted generally, or whether different industry bodies, such as the loan market and the derivatives market, will adopt the same methodologies. in addition, as part of the transition to a replacement benchmark, parties may seek to adjust the spreads relative to such benchmarks in underlying contractual arrangements. as a result, interest rates on our clos and other financial instruments tied to ibor rates, including those where blackstone or its funds are exposed as lender or borrower, as well as the revenue and expenses associated with those financial instruments, may be adversely affected.
further, any uncertainty regarding the continued use and reliability of any ibor as a benchmark interest rate could adversely affect the value of our and our portfolio companies' financial instruments tied to such rates. there is no guarantee that a transition from any ibor to an alternative will not result in financial market disruptions or a significant increase in volatility in risk free benchmark rates or borrowing costs to borrowers. although we have been proactively negotiating provisions in our portfolio companies' and lending businesses' recent debt agreements to provide additional flexibility to address the transition away from ibor, there is no assurance that we will be able to adequately minimize the risk of disruption from the discontinuation of ibor or other changes to benchmark indices.
in addition, meaningful time and effort is required to transition to the use of new benchmark rates, including with respect to the negotiation and implementation of any necessary changes to existing contractual arrangements and the implementation of changes to our systems and processes. we are actively evaluating the operational and other impacts of such changes and managing transition efforts accordingly.
the historical returns attributable to our funds should not be considered as indicative of the future results of our funds or of our future results or of any returns expected on an investment in class a commons stock.
the historical and potential future returns of the investment funds that we manage are not directly linked to returns on our class a common stock. therefore, any continued positive performance of the investment funds that we manage will not necessarily result in positive returns on an investment in our class a common stock. however, poor performance of the investment funds that we manage would cause a decline in our revenue from such investment funds, and would therefore have a negative effect on our performance and in all likelihood the returns on an investment in our class a common stock.
moreover, with respect to the historical returns of our investment funds:
•   we may create new funds in the future that reflect a different asset mix and different investment strategies, as well as a varied geographic and industry exposure as compared to our present funds, and any such new funds could have different returns from our existing or previous funds,
•   despite periods of volatility, market conditions have been largely favorable in recent years, which has helped to generate positive performance, particularly in our private equity and real estate businesses, but there can be no assurance that such conditions will repeat or that our current or future investment funds will avail themselves of comparable market conditions,
•   the rates of returns of our carry funds reflect unrealized gains as of the applicable measurement date that may never be realized, which may adversely affect the ultimate value realized from those funds' investments,
•   competition for investment opportunities resulting from, among other things, the increased amount of capital invested in alternative investment funds continues to increase,
•   our investment funds' returns in some years benefited from investment opportunities and general market conditions that may not repeat themselves, our current or future investment funds might not be able to avail themselves of comparable investment opportunities or market conditions, and the circumstances under which our current or future funds may make future investments may differ significantly from those conditions prevailing in the past,
•   newly established funds may generate lower returns during the period in which they initially deploy their capital, and
•   the rates of return reflect our historical cost structure, which may vary in the future due to various factors enumerated elsewhere in this report and other factors beyond our control, including changes in laws.
the future internal rate of return for any current or future fund may vary considerably from the historical internal rate of return generated by any particular fund, or for our funds as a whole. in addition, future returns will be affected by the applicable risks described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10-k, including risks of the industries and businesses in which a particular fund invests.
dependence on significant leverage in investments by our funds could adversely affect our ability to achieve attractive rates of return on those investments.
many of our funds' investments rely heavily on the use of leverage, and our ability to achieve attractive rates of return on investments will depend on our ability to access sufficient sources of indebtedness at attractive rates. for example, in many private equity and real estate investments, indebtedness may constitute as much as 70% or more of a portfolio company's or real estate asset's total debt and equity capitalization, including debt that may be incurred in connection with the investment. the absence of available sources of sufficient senior debt financing for extended periods of time could therefore materially and adversely affect our private equity and real estate businesses. in addition, in march 2013, the federal reserve and other u.s. federal banking agencies issued updated leveraged lending guidance covering transactions characterized by a degree of financial leverage. such guidance may limit the amount or cost of financing we are able to obtain for our transactions, and as a result, the returns on our investments may suffer. however, the status of the 2013 leveraged lending guidance remains uncertain following a determination by the government accountability office in october 2017 that resulted in such guidance being required to be submitted to congress for review. the guidance could possibly be overturned if a joint resolution of disapproval is passed by congress. furthermore, new limits on the deductibility of corporate interest expense could make it more costly to use debt financing for our acquisitions or otherwise have an adverse impact on the cost structure of our transactions, and could therefore adversely affect the returns on our funds' investments. see "- comprehensive u.s. federal income tax reform became effective in 2018, which could adversely affect us."
in addition, an increase in either the general levels of interest rates or in the risk spread demanded by sources of indebtedness would make it more expensive to finance those businesses' investments. see "- an increase in interest rates and other changes in the debt financing markets could negatively impact the ability of our funds and their portfolio companies to obtain attractive financing or refinancing and could increase the cost of such financing if it is obtained, which could lead to lower-yielding investments and potentially decrease our net income."
investments in highly leveraged entities are inherently more sensitive to declines in revenues, increases in expenses and interest rates and adverse economic, market and industry developments. the incurrence of a significant amount of indebtedness by an entity could, among other things:
•   give rise to an obligation to make mandatory pre-payments of debt using excess cash flow, which might limit the entity's ability to respond to changing industry conditions to the extent additional cash is needed for the response, to make unplanned but necessary capital expenditures or to take advantage of growth opportunities,
•   limit the entity's ability to adjust to changing market conditions, thereby placing it at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors who have relatively less debt,
•   allow even moderate reductions in operating cash flow to render it unable to service its indebtedness, leading to a bankruptcy or other reorganization of the entity and a loss of part or all of the equity investment in it,
•   limit the entity's ability to engage in strategic acquisitions that might be necessary to generate attractive returns or further growth, and
•   limit the entity's ability to obtain additional financing or increase the cost of obtaining such financing, including for capital expenditures, working capital or general corporate purposes.
as a result, the risk of loss associated with a leveraged entity is generally greater than for companies with comparatively less debt. for example, many investments consummated by private equity sponsors during 2005, 2006 and 2007 that utilized significant amounts of leverage subsequently experienced severe economic stress and, in certain cases, defaulted on their debt obligations due to a decrease in revenues and cash flow precipitated by the subsequent economic downturn during 2008 and 2009.
when our funds' existing portfolio investments reach the point when debt incurred to finance those investments matures in significant amounts and must be either repaid or refinanced, those investments may materially suffer if they have generated insufficient cash flow to repay maturing debt and there is insufficient capacity and availability in the financing markets to permit them to refinance maturing debt on satisfactory terms, or at all. if a limited availability of financing for such purposes were to persist for an extended period of time, when significant amounts of the debt incurred to finance our private equity and real estate funds' existing portfolio investments came due, these funds could be materially and adversely affected.
many of the hedge funds in which our funds of hedge funds invest and our credit-focused funds, or clos, may choose to use leverage as part of their respective investment programs and regularly borrow a substantial amount of their capital. the use of leverage poses a significant degree of risk and enhances the possibility of a significant loss in the value of the investment portfolio. a fund may borrow money from time to time to purchase or carry securities or may enter into derivative transactions (such as total return swaps) with counterparties that have embedded leverage. the interest expense and other costs incurred in connection with such borrowing may not be recovered by appreciation in the securities purchased or carried and will be lost - and the timing and magnitude of such losses may be accelerated or exacerbated - in the event of a decline in the market value of such securities. gains realized with borrowed funds may cause the fund's net asset value to increase at a faster rate than would be the case without borrowings. however, if investment results fail to cover the cost of borrowings, the fund's net asset value could also decrease faster than if there had been no borrowings.
any of the foregoing circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
the due diligence process that we undertake in connection with investments by our investment funds may not reveal all facts and issues that may be relevant in connection with an investment.
when evaluating a potential business or asset for investment, we conduct due diligence that we deem reasonable and appropriate based on the facts and circumstances applicable to such investment. when conducting due diligence, we may be required to evaluate important and complex issues, including but not limited to those related to business, financial, credit risk, tax, accounting, esg, legal and regulatory and macroeconomic trends. with respect to esg, the nature and scope of our diligence will vary based on the investment, but may include a review of, among other things: air and water pollution, diversity, employee health and safety, accounting standards and bribery and corruption. outside consultants, legal advisers, accountants and investment banks may be involved in the due diligence process in varying degrees depending on the type of investment. the due diligence investigation that we will carry out with respect to any investment opportunity may not reveal or highlight all relevant facts (including fraud) or risks that may be necessary or helpful in evaluating such investment opportunity and we may not identify or foresee future developments that could have a material adverse effect on an investment, including, for example, potential factors, such as technological disruption of a specific company or asset, or an entire industry. further, some matters covered by our diligence, such as esg, are continuously evolving and we may not accurately or fully anticipate such evolution. in addition, when conducting due diligence on investments, including with respect to investments made by our funds of hedge funds in third party hedge funds, we rely on the resources available to us and information supplied by third parties, including information provided by the target of the investment (or, in the case of investments in a third party hedge fund, information provided by such hedge fund or its service providers). the information we receive from third parties may not be accurate or complete and therefore we may not have all the relevant facts and information necessary to properly assess and monitor our funds' investment.
our asset management activities involve investments in relatively high-risk, illiquid assets, and we may fail to realize any profits from these activities for a considerable period of time or lose some or all of our principal investments.
many of our investment funds invest in securities that are not publicly traded. in many cases, our investment funds may be prohibited by contract or by applicable securities laws from selling such securities for a period of time. our investment funds will generally not be able to sell these securities publicly unless their sale is registered under applicable securities laws, or unless an exemption from such registration is available. the ability of many of our investment funds, particularly our private equity funds, to dispose of investments is heavily dependent on the public equity markets. for example, the ability to realize any value from an investment may depend upon the ability to complete an initial public offering of the portfolio company in which such investment is held. even if the securities are publicly traded, large holdings of securities can often be disposed of only over a substantial length of time, exposing the investment returns to risks of downward movement in market prices during the intended disposition period. moreover, because the investment strategy of many of our funds, particularly our private equity and real estate funds, often entails our having representation on our funds' public portfolio company boards, our funds may be restricted in their ability to effect such sales during certain time periods. accordingly, under certain conditions, our investment funds may be forced to either sell securities at lower prices than they had expected to realize or defer - potentially for a considerable period of time - sales that they had planned to make. we have made and expect to continue to make significant principal investments in our current and future investment funds. contributing capital to these investment funds is risky, and we may lose some or the entire principal amount of our investments.
we pursue large or otherwise complex investments, which involve enhanced business, regulatory, legal and other risks.
a number of our funds, including our real estate and private equity funds, have invested and intend to continue to invest in large transactions or transactions that otherwise have substantial business, regulatory or legal complexity. in addition, as we raise new funds, such funds' mandates may include investing in such transactions. such investments involve enhanced risks. for example, larger or otherwise complex transactions may be more difficult, expensive and time-consuming to finance and execute. in addition, managing or realizing value from such investments may be more difficult as a result of, among other things, a limited universe of potential acquirers. in addition, larger or otherwise complex transactions may entail a higher level of scrutiny by regulators, labor unions and other third parties, as well as a greater risk of unknown and/or contingent liabilities. any of these factors could increase the risk that our larger or more complex investments could be less successful and in turn harm the performance of our funds.
larger transactions may be structured as "consortium transactions" due to the size of the investment and the amount of capital required to be invested. a consortium transaction involves an equity investment in which two or more investors serve together or collectively as equity sponsors. we have historically participated in a significant number of consortium transactions due to the increased size of many of the transactions in which we have been involved. consortium transactions generally entail a reduced level of control by blackstone over the investment because governance rights must be shared with the other investors. accordingly, we may not be able to control decisions relating to the investment, including decisions relating to the management and operation of the company and the timing and nature of any exit, which could result in the risks described in "- our investment funds make investments in companies that we do not control." in addition, the consequences to our investment funds of an unsuccessful larger investment could be more severe given the size of the investment.
our investment funds make investments in companies that we do not control.
investments by most of our investment funds will include debt instruments and equity securities of companies that we do not control. such investments will be subject to the risk that the company in which the investment is made may make business, financial or management decisions with which we do not agree or that the majority stakeholders or the management of the company may take risks or otherwise act in a manner that does not serve our interests. in addition, to the extent we hold only a minority equity interest in a company, we may lack affirmative control rights, which may diminish our ability to influence the company's affairs in a manner intended to enhance the value of our investment in the company, including with respect to the form and timing of an exit. if any of the foregoing were to occur, the values of investments by our investment funds could decrease and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow could suffer as a result.
we expect to make investments in companies that are based outside of the united states, which may expose us to additional risks not typically associated with investing in companies that are based in the united states.
many of our investment funds generally invest a significant portion of their assets in the equity, debt, loans or other securities of issuers located outside the united states. international investments have increased and we expect will continue to increase as a proportion of certain of our funds' portfolios in the future. investments in non-u.s. securities involve certain factors not typically associated with investing in u.s. securities, including risks relating to:
•   currency exchange matters, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and costs associated with conversion of investment principal and income from one currency into another,
•   less developed or efficient financial markets than in the united states, which may lead to potential price volatility and relative illiquidity,
•   the absence of uniform accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards, practices and disclosure requirements and less government supervision and regulation,
•   changes in laws or clarifications to existing laws that could impact our tax treaty positions, which could adversely impact the returns on our investments,
•   a less developed legal or regulatory environment, differences in the legal and regulatory environment or enhanced legal and regulatory compliance,
•   heightened exposure to corruption risk in non-u.s. markets,
•   political hostility to investments by foreign or private equity investors,
•   reliance on a more limited number of commodity inputs, service providers and/or distribution mechanisms,
•   higher transaction costs,
•   difficulty in enforcing contractual obligations,
•   fewer investor protections and less publicly available information in respect of companies in non-u.s. markets,
•   certain economic and political risks, including potential exchange control regulations and restrictions on our non-u.s. investments and repatriation of profits on investments or of capital invested, the risks of political, economic or social instability, the possibility of expropriation or confiscatory taxation and adverse economic and political developments, and
•   the possible imposition of non-u.s. taxes or withholding on income and gains recognized with respect to such securities.
in addition, investments in companies that are based outside of the united states may be negatively impacted by restrictions on international trade or the recent or potential further imposition of tariffs. see "- the potential for further governmental policy and/or legislative changes and regulatory reform creates uncertainty for our investment strategies, may make it more difficult to operate our business, and may adversely affect the profitability of our funds' portfolio companies."
there can be no assurance that adverse developments with respect to such risks will not adversely affect our assets that are held in certain countries or the returns from these assets.
we may not have sufficient cash to pay back "clawback" obligations if and when they are triggered under the governing agreements with our investors.
in certain circumstances, at the end of the life of a carry fund (or earlier with respect to certain of our real estate funds, real estate debt funds and certain multi-asset class and/or opportunistic investment funds), as a result of diminished performance of later investments in any carry fund's life, we may be obligated to repay the amount by which performance allocations that were previously distributed to us exceed the amounts to which the relevant general partner is ultimately entitled on an after-tax basis. this includes situations in which the general partner receives in excess of the relevant performance allocations applicable to the fund as applied to the fund's cumulative net profits over the life of the fund or, in some cases, the fund has not achieved investment returns that exceed the preferred return threshold. this obligation is known as a "clawback" obligation and is an obligation of any person who received such performance allocations, including us and other participants in our performance allocations plans. although a portion of any dividends by us to our shareholders may include any performance allocations received by us, we do not intend to seek fulfillment of any clawback obligation by seeking to have our shareholders return any portion of such dividends attributable to performance allocations associated with any clawback obligation. to the extent we are required to fulfill a clawback obligation, however, our board of directors may determine to decrease the amount of our dividends to our shareholders. the clawback obligation operates with respect to a given carry fund's own net investment performance only and performance of other funds are not netted for determining this contingent obligation.
adverse economic conditions may increase the likelihood that one or more of our carry funds may be subject to clawback obligations upon the end of their respective lives (or earlier with respect to certain of our real estate funds, real estate debt funds and certain multi-asset class and/or opportunistic investment funds). to the extent one or more clawback obligations were to occur for any one or more carry funds, we might not have available cash at the time such clawback obligation is triggered to repay the performance allocations and satisfy such obligation. if we were unable to repay such performance allocations, we would be in breach of the governing agreements with our investors and could be subject to liability. moreover, although a clawback obligation is several, the governing agreements of most of our funds provide that to the extent another recipient of performance allocations (such as a current or former employee) does not fund his or her respective share, then we and our employees who participate in such performance allocations plans may have to fund additional amounts (generally an additional 50-70% beyond our pro-rata share of such obligations) beyond what we actually received in performance allocations, although we retain the right to pursue any remedies that we have under such governing agreements against those performance allocations recipients who fail to fund their obligations.
investments by our investment funds will in many cases rank junior to investments made by others.
in most cases, the companies in which our investment funds invest will have indebtedness or equity securities, or may be permitted to incur indebtedness or to issue equity securities, that rank senior to our investment. by their terms, such instruments may provide that their holders are entitled to receive payments of dividends, interest or principal on or before the dates on which payments are to be made in respect of our investment. also, in the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of a company in which an investment is made, holders of securities ranking senior to our investment would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before distributions could be made in respect of our investment. after repaying senior security holders, the company may not have any remaining assets to use for repaying amounts owed in respect of our investment. to the extent that any assets remain, holders of claims that rank equally with our investment would be entitled to share on an equal and ratable basis in distributions that are made out of those assets. also, during periods of financial distress or following an insolvency, the ability of our investment funds to influence a company's affairs and to take actions to protect their investments may be substantially less than that of the senior creditors.
investors in our hedge funds or open-ended funds may redeem their investments in these funds. in addition, the investment management agreements related to our separately managed accounts may permit the investor to terminate our management of such account on short notice. lastly, investors in our other investment funds have the right to cause these investment funds to be dissolved. any of these events would lead to a decrease in our revenues, which could be substantial.
investors in our hedge funds may generally redeem their investments on an annual, semi-annual or quarterly basis following the expiration of a specified period of time when capital may not be withdrawn, subject to the applicable fund's specific redemption provisions. in addition, we have certain other open-ended funds, including core+ real estate and certain real estate debt funds, which contain similar redemption provisions in their governing documents. in a declining market, many hedge funds and other open-ended funds, including some of our funds, may experience declines in value, and the pace of redemptions and consequent reduction in our assets under management could accelerate. such declines in value may be both provoked and exacerbated by margin calls and forced selling of assets. to the extent appropriate and permissible under a fund's constituent documents, we may limit or suspend redemptions during a redemption period, which may have a reputational impact on us. see "- hedge fund investments are subject to numerous additional risks." the decrease in revenues that would result from significant redemptions in our hedge funds and other open-ended funds could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, net income and cash flows.
we currently manage a significant portion of investor assets through separately managed accounts whereby we earn management and/or incentive fees, and we intend to continue to seek additional separately managed account mandates. the investment management agreements we enter into in connection with managing separately managed accounts on behalf of certain clients may be terminated by such clients on as little as 30 days' prior written notice. in addition, the boards of directors of the investment management companies we manage could terminate our advisory engagement of those companies, on as little as 30 days' prior written notice. in the case of any such terminations, the management and incentive fees we earn in connection with managing such account or company would immediately cease, which could result in a significant adverse impact on our revenues.
the governing agreements of most of our investment funds (with the exception of certain of our funds of hedge funds, hedge funds, certain credit-focused and real estate debt funds, and other funds or separately managed accounts for the benefit of one or more specified investors) provide that, subject to certain conditions, third party investors in those funds have the right to remove the general partner of the fund or to accelerate the termination date of the investment fund without cause by a simple majority vote, resulting in a reduction in management fees we would earn from such investment funds and a significant reduction in the amounts of performance allocations and incentive fees from those funds. performance allocations and incentive fees could be significantly reduced as a result of our inability to maximize the value of investments by an investment fund during the liquidation process or in the event of the triggering of a "clawback" obligation. in addition, the governing agreements of our investment funds provide that in the event certain "key persons" in our investment funds do not meet specified time commitments with regard to managing the fund, then investors in certain funds have the right to vote to terminate the investment period by a specified percentage (including, in certain cases, a simple majority) vote in accordance with specified procedures, accelerate the withdrawal of their capital on an investor-by-investor basis, or the fund's investment period will automatically terminate and a specified percentage (including, in certain cases, a simple majority) vote of investors is required to restart it. in addition, the governing agreements of some of our investment funds provide that investors have the right to terminate, for any reason, the investment period by a vote of 75% of the investors in such fund. in addition to having a significant negative impact on our revenue, net income and cash flow, the occurrence of such an event with respect to any of our investment funds would likely result in significant reputational damage to us.
in addition, because all of our investment funds have advisers that are registered under the advisers act, an "assignment" of the management agreements of all of our investment funds (which may be deemed to occur in the event these advisers were to experience a change of control) would generally be prohibited without investor consent. we cannot be certain that consents required for assignments of our investment management agreements will be obtained if a change of control occurs, which could result in the termination of such agreements. in addition, with respect to our 1940 act registered funds, each investment fund's investment management agreement must be approved annually by the independent members of such investment fund's board of directors and, in certain cases, by its shareholders, as required by law. termination of these agreements would cause us to lose the fees we earn from such investment funds.
third party investors in our investment funds with commitment-based structures may not satisfy their contractual obligation to fund capital calls when requested by us, which could adversely affect a fund's operations and performance.
investors in all of our carry funds (and certain of our hedge funds) make capital commitments to those funds that we are entitled to call from those investors at any time during prescribed periods. we depend on investors fulfilling their commitments when we call capital from them in order for those funds to consummate investments and otherwise pay their obligations (for example, management fees) when due. a default by an investor may also limit a fund's availability to incur borrowings and avail itself of what would otherwise have been available credit. we have not had investors fail to honor capital calls to any meaningful extent. any investor that did not fund a capital call would generally be subject to several possible penalties, including having a significant amount of its existing investment forfeited in that fund. however, the impact of the forfeiture penalty is directly correlated to the amount of capital previously invested by the investor in the fund and if an investor has invested little or no capital, for instance early in the life of the fund, then the forfeiture penalty may not be as meaningful. third party investors in private equity, real estate and venture capital funds typically use distributions from prior investments to meet future capital calls. in cases where valuations of investors' existing investments fall and the pace of distributions slows, investors may be unable to make new commitments to third party managed investment funds such as those advised by us. if investors were to fail to satisfy a significant amount of capital calls for any particular fund or funds, the operation and performance of those funds could be materially and adversely affected.
risk management activities may adversely affect the return on our funds' investments.
when managing our exposure to market risks, we may (on our own behalf or on behalf of our funds) from time to time use forward contracts, options, swaps, caps, collars and floors or pursue other strategies or use other forms of derivative instruments to limit our exposure to changes in the relative values of investments that may result from market developments, including changes in prevailing interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. the success of any hedging or other derivative transactions generally will depend on our ability to correctly predict market changes, the degree of correlation between price movements of a derivative instrument, the position being hedged, the creditworthiness of the counterparty and other factors. as a result, while we may enter into a transaction in order to reduce our exposure to market risks, the transaction may result in poorer overall investment performance than if it had not been executed. such transactions may also limit the opportunity for gain if the value of a hedged position increases.
while such hedging arrangements may reduce certain risks, such arrangements themselves may entail certain other risks. these arrangements may require the posting of cash collateral at a time when a fund has insufficient cash or illiquid assets such that the posting of the cash is either impossible or requires the sale of assets at prices that do not reflect their underlying value. moreover, these hedging arrangements may generate significant transaction costs, including potential tax costs, that reduce the returns generated by a fund. finally, the cftc may in the future require certain foreign exchange products to be subject to mandatory clearing, which could increase the cost of entering into currency hedges.
our real estate funds are subject to the risks inherent in the ownership and operation of real estate and the construction and development of real estate.
investments in our real estate funds will be subject to the risks inherent in the ownership and operation of real estate and real estate-related businesses and assets, including the deterioration of real estate fundamentals. these risks include but are not limited to, those associated with the burdens of ownership of real property, general and local economic conditions, changes in supply of and demand for competing properties in an area (as a result, for instance, of overbuilding), fluctuations in the average occupancy and room rates for hotel properties, operating income, the financial resources of tenants, changes in building, environmental, zoning and other laws, casualty or condemnation losses, energy and supply shortages, various uninsured or uninsurable risks, natural disasters, changes in government regulations (such as rent control), changes in real property tax rates, changes in income tax rates, changes in interest rates, the reduced availability of mortgage funds which may render the sale or refinancing of properties difficult or impracticable, increased mortgage defaults, increases in borrowing rates, changes to the taxation of business entities and the deductibility of corporate interest expense, negative developments in the economy that depress travel activity, environmental liabilities, contingent liabilities on disposition of assets, acts of god, terrorist attacks, war and other factors that are beyond our control. in addition, if our real estate funds acquire direct or indirect interests in undeveloped land or underdeveloped real property, which may often be non-income producing, they will be subject to the risks normally associated with such assets and development activities, including risks relating to the availability and timely receipt of zoning and other regulatory or environmental approvals, the cost and timely completion of construction (including risks beyond the control of our fund, such as weather or labor conditions or material shortages) and the availability of both construction and permanent financing on favorable terms. in addition, our real estate funds may also make investments in residential real estate projects and/or otherwise participate in financing opportunities relating to residential real estate assets or portfolios thereof from time to time, which may be more highly susceptible to adverse changes in prevailing economic and/or market conditions and present additional risks relative to the ownership and operation of commercial real estate assets.
certain of our investment funds may invest in securities of companies that are experiencing significant financial or business difficulties, including companies involved in bankruptcy or other reorganization and liquidation proceedings. such investments are subject to a greater risk of poor performance or loss.
certain of our investment funds, especially our credit-focused funds, may invest in business enterprises involved in work-outs, liquidations, spin-offs, reorganizations, bankruptcies and similar transactions and may purchase high-risk receivables. an investment in such business enterprises entails the risk that the transaction in which such business enterprise is involved either will be unsuccessful, will take considerable time or will result in a distribution of cash or a new security the value of which will be less than the purchase price to the fund of the security or other financial instrument in respect of which such distribution is received. in addition, if an anticipated transaction does not in fact occur, the fund may be required to sell its investment at a loss. investments in troubled companies may also be adversely affected by u.s. federal and state laws relating to, among other things, fraudulent conveyances, voidable preferences, lender liability and a bankruptcy court's discretionary power to disallow, subordinate or disenfranchise particular claims. investments in securities and private claims of troubled companies made in connection with an attempt to influence a restructuring proposal or plan of reorganization in a bankruptcy case may also involve substantial litigation. because there is substantial uncertainty concerning the outcome of transactions involving financially troubled companies, there is a potential risk of loss by a fund of its entire investment in such company. moreover, a major economic recession could have a materially adverse impact on the value of such securities. adverse publicity and investor perceptions, whether or not based on fundamental analysis, may also decrease the value and liquidity of securities rated below investment grade or otherwise adversely affect our reputation.
in addition, at least one federal circuit court has determined that an investment fund could be liable for erisa title iv pension obligations (including withdrawal liability incurred with respect to union multiemployer plans) of its portfolio companies, if such fund is a "trade or business" and the fund's ownership interest in the portfolio company is significant enough to bring the investment fund within the portfolio company's "controlled group." while a number of cases have held that managing investments is not a "trade or business" for tax purposes, the circuit court in this case concluded the investment fund could be a "trade or business" for erisa purposes based on certain factors, including the fund's level of involvement in the management of its portfolio companies and the nature of its management fee arrangements. litigation related to the circuit court's decision suggests that additional factors may be relevant for purposes of determining whether an investment fund could face "controlled group" liability under erisa, including the structure of the investment and the nature of the fund's relationship with other affiliated investors and co-investors in the portfolio company. moreover, regardless of whether an investment fund is determined to be a "trade or business" for purposes of erisa, a court might hold that one of the fund's portfolio companies could become jointly and severally liable for another portfolio company's unfunded pension liabilities pursuant to the erisa "controlled group" rules, depending upon the relevant investment structures and ownership interests as noted above.
investments in energy, manufacturing, infrastructure, real estate and certain other assets may expose us to increased environmental liabilities that are inherent in the ownership of real assets.
ownership of real assets in our funds or vehicles may increase our risk of liability under environmental laws that impose, regardless of fault, joint and several liability for the cost of remediating contamination and compensation for damages. in addition, changes in environmental laws or regulations or the environmental condition of an investment may create liabilities that did not exist at the time of acquisition. even in cases where we are indemnified by a seller against liabilities arising out of violations of environmental laws and regulations, there can be no assurance as to the financial viability of the seller to satisfy such indemnities or our ability to achieve enforcement of such indemnities.
investments by our funds in the power and energy industries involve various operational, construction, regulatory and market risks.
the development, operation and maintenance of power and energy generation facilities involves many risks, including, as applicable, labor issues, start-up risks, breakdown or failure of facilities, lack of sufficient capital to maintain the facilities and the dependence on a specific fuel source. power and energy generation facilities in which our funds invest are also subject to risks associated with volatility in the price of fuel sources and the impact of unusual or adverse weather conditions or other natural events, as well as the risk of performance below expected levels of output, efficiency or reliability. the occurrence of any such items could result in lost revenues and/or increased expenses. in turn, such developments could impair a portfolio company's ability to repay its debt or conduct its operations. we may also choose or be required to decommission a power generation facility or other asset. the decommissioning process could be protracted and result in the incurrence of significant financial and/or regulatory obligations or other uncertainties.
our power and energy sector portfolio companies may also face construction risks typical for power generation and related infrastructure businesses. such developments could result in substantial unanticipated delays or expenses and, under certain circumstances, could prevent completion of construction activities once undertaken. delays in the completion of any power project may result in lost revenues or increased expenses, including higher operation and maintenance costs related to such portfolio company.
the power and energy sectors are the subject of substantial and complex laws, rules and regulation by various federal and state regulatory agencies. failure to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations could result in the prevention of operation of certain facilities or the prevention of the sale of such a facility to a third party, as well as the loss of certain rate authority, refund liability, penalties and other remedies, all of which could result in additional costs to a portfolio company and adversely affect the investment results. in addition, any legislative efforts by the trump administration to overturn or modify policies or regulations enacted by the prior administration that placed limitations on coal and gas electric generation, mining and/or exploration could adversely affect certain of our energy investments, including our alternative energy investments. conversely, any governmental policy changes encouraging resource extraction could have the effect of supporting low energy prices, which could have a negative impact on certain of our energy investments. in addition, in recent years, there has been an increased focus by investors and other market participants on energy sustainability and increased activism, including through divestment of existing investments, with respect to sustainability-focused investing by asset managers, which could have a negative impact on our ability to exit certain of our energy investments or adversely affect the expected returns of new investment opportunities.
our businesses that invest in the energy industry also focus on investments in businesses involved in oil and gas exploration and development, which can be a speculative business involving a high degree of risk, including:
•   the use of new technologies, including hydraulic fracturing,
•   reliance on estimates of oil and gas reserves in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each reservoir, and
•   encountering unexpected formations or pressures, premature declines of reservoirs, blow-outs, equipment failures and other accidents in completing wells and otherwise, cratering, sour gas releases, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, adverse weather conditions, pollution, fires, spills and other environmental risks.
in addition, the performance of the investments made by our credit and equity funds in the energy and natural resources markets are also subject to a high degree of market risk, as such investments are likely to be directly or indirectly substantially dependent upon prevailing prices of oil, natural gas and other commodities. oil and natural gas prices are subject to wide fluctuation in response to factors beyond the control of us or our funds' portfolio companies, including relatively minor changes in the supply and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty, the level of consumer product demand, weather conditions, climate initiatives, governmental regulation, the price and availability of alternative fuels, political and economic conditions in oil producing countries, foreign supply of such commodities and overall domestic and foreign economic conditions. these factors make it difficult to predict future commodity price movements with any certainty.
our investments in infrastructure assets may expose us to increased risks that are inherent in the ownership of real assets.
investments in infrastructure assets may expose us to increased risks that are inherent in the ownership of real assets. for example,
•   ownership of infrastructure assets may present risk of liability for personal and property injury or impose significant operating challenges and costs with respect to, for example, compliance with zoning, environmental or other applicable laws.
•   infrastructure asset investments may face construction risks including, without limitation: (a) labor disputes, shortages of material and skilled labor, or work stoppages, (b) slower than projected construction progress and the unavailability or late delivery of necessary equipment, (c) less than optimal coordination with public utilities in the relocation of their facilities, (d) adverse weather conditions and unexpected construction conditions, (e) accidents or the breakdown or failure of construction equipment or processes; and (f) catastrophic events such as explosions, fires, terrorist activities and other similar events. these risks could result in substantial unanticipated delays or expenses (which may exceed expected or forecasted budgets) and, under certain circumstances, could prevent completion of construction activities once undertaken. certain infrastructure asset investments may remain in construction phases for a prolonged period and, accordingly, may not be cash generative for a prolonged period. recourse against the contractor may be subject to liability caps or may be subject to default or insolvency on the part of the contractor.
•   the operation of infrastructure assets is exposed to potential unplanned interruptions caused by significant catastrophic or force majeure events. these risks could, among other effects, adversely impact the cash flows available from investments in infrastructure assets, cause personal injury or loss of life, damage property, or instigate disruptions of service. in addition, the cost of repairing or replacing damaged assets could be considerable. repeated or prolonged service interruptions may result in permanent loss of customers, litigation, or penalties for regulatory or contractual non-compliance. force majeure events that are incapable of, or too costly to, cure may also have a permanent adverse effect on an investment.
•   the management of the business or operations of an infrastructure asset may be contracted to a third party management company unaffiliated with us. although it would be possible to replace any such operator, the failure of such an operator to adequately perform its duties or to act in ways that are in our best interest, or the breach by an operator of applicable agreements or laws, rules and regulations, could have an adverse effect on the investment's financial condition or results of operations. infrastructure investments may involve the subcontracting of design and construction activities in respect of projects, and as a result our investments are subject to the risks that contractual provisions passing liabilities to a subcontractor could be ineffective, the subcontractor fails to perform services which it has agreed to perform and the subcontractor becomes insolvent.
infrastructure investments often involve an ongoing commitment to a municipal, state, federal or foreign government or regulatory agencies. the nature of these obligations expose us to a higher level of regulatory control than typically imposed on other businesses and may require us to rely on complex government licenses, concessions, leases or contracts, which may be difficult to obtain or maintain. infrastructure investments may require operators to manage such investments and such operators' failure to comply with laws, including prohibitions against bribing of government officials, may adversely affect the value of such investments and cause us serious reputational and legal harm. revenues for such investments may rely on contractual agreements for the provision of services with a limited number of counterparties, and are consequently subject to counterparty default risk. the operations and cash flow of infrastructure investments are also more sensitive to inflation and, in certain cases, commodity price risk. furthermore, services provided by infrastructure investments may be subject to rate regulations by government entities that determine or limit prices that may be charged. similarly, users of applicable services or government entities in response to such users may react negatively to any adjustments in rates and thus reduce the profitability of such infrastructure investments.
our investments in the life science industry may expose us to increased risks.
in 2018, we launched bxls, a private investment platform with capabilities to invest across the life-cycle of companies and products within the key life sciences sectors. life sciences investing may expose us to increased risks. for example,
•   bxls's strategies include, among others, investments that are referred to as "pharmaceutical corporate partnership" transactions. pharmaceutical corporate partnership transactions are risk-sharing collaborations with large pharmaceutical partners on drug development programs and investments in royalty streams of pre-commercial pharmaceutical products. bxls's ability to source pharmaceutical corporate partnership transactions has been, and will continue to be, in part dependent on the ability of three special purpose development companies to identify, diligence, negotiate and in many cases, take the lead in executing the agreed development plans with respect to, a pharmaceutical corporate partnership transaction. moreover, as such special purpose development companies are jointly owned by us and two unaffiliated life sciences investors, we (and our funds) are not the sole beneficiaries of such sourcing strategies and capabilities of such special purpose development companies.
•   life sciences and healthcare companies are subject to extensive regulation by the u.s. food and drug administration, similar foreign regulatory authorities and, to a lesser extent, other federal and state agencies, prior to marketing their products to the public. these companies are subject to the expense, delay and uncertainty of the approval process, and there can be no guarantee that a particular product will obtain regulatory approval. in addition, the current regulatory framework may change or additional regulations may arise at any stage during the product development phase of an investment, which may delay or prevent regulatory approval or impact applicable exclusivity periods. if a company in which our funds are invested is unable to obtain regulatory approval for its product, or a product in which our funds are invested does not obtain regulatory approval, in a timely fashion or at all, the value of our investment would be adversely impacted. in addition, in connection with certain pharmaceutical corporate partnership transactions, our special purpose development companies will be contractually obligated to run clinical trials. in the event such clinical trials do not comply with the complicated regulatory requirements applicable thereto, such special purpose development companies may be subject to regulatory actions. lastly, if legislation is passed in the u.s. that reduces the applicable exclusivity period for biologic products, this reform could result in price reductions at an earlier stage of a product's life cycle than originally estimated by bxls, which could reduce the cumulative financial returns on bxls's investment in any such product.
•   intellectual property often constitutes an important part of a life sciences company's assets and competitive strengths, particularly for royalty monetization transactions. to the extent such companies' intellectual property positions with respect to products in which bxls invests, whether through a royalty or otherwise, are challenged, invalidated or circumvented, the value of bxls's investment may be impaired. the success of a life sciences investment depends in part on the ability of the pharmaceutical or other life sciences companies in whose products bxls invests to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of such products. the patent positions of such companies can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions.
•   the commercial success of products could be compromised if governmental or third party payers do not provide coverage and reimbursement, breach, rescind or modify their contracts or reimbursement policies or delay payments for such products. in both the u.s. and foreign markets, the successful sale of a life sciences company's product depends on the ability to obtain and maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement from third party payers, including government healthcare programs and private insurance plans. governments and third party payers continue to pursue aggressive initiatives to contain costs and manage drug utilization and are increasingly focused on the effectiveness, benefits and costs of similar treatments, which could result in lower reimbursement rates and narrower populations for whom the products in which bxls invests will be reimbursed by payers. to the extent an investment made by bxls relies in whole or in part on royalties or other payments based on product sales, adequate third party payer reimbursement may not be available to enable price levels for the product sufficient for bxls to realize an appropriate return on the investment.
our provision of products and services to insurance companies, including through blackstone insurance solutions, subjects us to a variety of risks and uncertainties.
blackstone insurance solutions, or bis, is a platform that we established relating to blackstone's development, distribution and management of tailored solutions for insurance companies worldwide. bis seeks to deliver to insurance companies customizable and diversified portfolios of blackstone products across asset classes, as well as the option for partial or full management of insurance companies' general account assets, and is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. bis currently manages assets for fidelity & guaranty life insurance company and certain of its affiliates pursuant to several investment management agreements. in addition, in july 2017, blackstone and axis capital co-sponsored the establishment of harrington reinsurance, a bermuda property & casualty reinsurance company, and bis currently manages all general account assets of harrington reinsurance. bis also manages or sub-manages assets for certain insurance-dedicated funds and has developed, and expects to continue to develop, other capital-efficient and tailored products for insurance companies. the success of bis will depend in large part on further developing investment partnerships with insurance company clients and maintaining existing asset management arrangements, including those described above. if we fail to deliver high-quality, high-performing products that help our insurance company clients meet long-term policyholder obligations, bis may not be successful in retaining existing investment partnerships, developing new investment partnerships or selling its capital-efficient products and such failure may have a material adverse effect on our business, results and financial condition.
the u.s. and non-u.s. insurance industries are subject to significant regulatory oversight. regulatory authorities in many relevant jurisdictions have broad regulatory (including through any regulatory support organization), administrative, and in some cases discretionary, authority with respect to insurance companies and/or their investment advisors, which may include, among other things, the investments insurance companies may acquire and hold, marketing practices, affiliate transactions, reserve requirements and capital adequacy. these requirements are primarily concerned with the protection of policyholders, and regulatory authorities often have wide discretion in applying the relevant restrictions and regulations to insurance companies, which may indirectly affect bis and other blackstone businesses that offer products or services to insurance companies. we may be the target or subject of, or may have indemnification obligations related to, litigation (including class action litigation by policyholders), enforcement investigations or regulatory scrutiny. regulators and other authorities generally have the power to bring administrative or judicial proceedings against insurance companies, which could result in, among other things, suspension or revocation of licenses, cease-and-desist orders, fines, civil penalties, criminal penalties or other disciplinary action. to the extent bis or another blackstone business that offers products or services to insurance companies is directly or indirectly involved in such regulatory actions, our reputation could be harmed, we may become liable for indemnification obligations and we could potentially be subject to enforcement actions, fines and penalties.
some of the arrangements we have or will develop with insurance companies involve complex u.s. and non-u.s. tax structures for which no clear precedent or authority may be available. such structures may be subject to potential regulatory, legislative, judicial or administrative change or scrutiny and differing interpretations and any adverse regulatory, legislative, judicial or administrative changes, scrutiny or interpretations may result in substantial costs to insurance companies or bis. in some cases we may agree to indemnify insurance companies for their losses resulting from any such adverse changes or interpretations.
insurance company investment portfolios are often subject to internal and regulatory requirements governing the categories and ratings of investment products they may acquire and hold. many of the investment products we develop for, or other assets or investments we include in, insurance company portfolios will be rated and a ratings downgrade or any other negative action by a rating agency with respect to such products, assets or investments could make them less attractive and limit our ability to offer such products to, or invest or deploy capital on behalf of, insurers.
any failure to properly manage or address the foregoing risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, results and financial condition.
the financial projections of our funds' portfolio companies could prove inaccurate.
the capital structure of a fund's portfolio company is generally set up at the time of the fund's investment in the portfolio company based on, among other factors, financial projects prepared by the portfolio company's management. these projected operating results will normally be based primarily on judgments of the management of the portfolio companies. in all cases, projections are only estimates of future results that are based upon assumptions made at the time that the projections are developed. general economic conditions, which are not predictable, along with other factors may cause actual performance to fall short of such the financial projections. because of the leverage we typically employ in our investments, this could cause a substantial decrease in the value of our equity holdings in the portfolio company. the inaccuracy of financial projections could thus cause our funds' performance to fall short of our expectations.
contingent liabilities could harm fund performance.
we may cause our funds to acquire an investment that is subject to contingent liabilities. such contingent liabilities could be unknown to us at the time of acquisition or, if they are known to us, we may not accurately assess or protect against the risks that they present. acquired contingent liabilities could thus result in unforeseen losses for our funds. in addition, in connection with the disposition of an investment in a portfolio company, a fund may be required to make representations about the business and financial affairs of such portfolio company typical of those made in connection with the sale of a business. a fund may also be required to indemnify the purchasers of such investment to the extent that any such representations are inaccurate. these arrangements may result in the incurrence of contingent liabilities by a fund, even after the disposition of an investment. accordingly, the inaccuracy of representations and warranties made by a fund could harm such fund's performance.
our funds may be forced to dispose of investments at a disadvantageous time.
our funds may make investments of which they do not advantageously dispose of prior to the date the applicable fund is dissolved, either by expiration of such fund's term or otherwise. although we generally expect that our funds will dispose of investments prior to dissolution or that investments will be suitable for in-kind distribution at dissolution, we may not be able to do so. the general partners of our funds have only a limited ability to extend the term of the fund with the consent of fund investors or the advisory board of the fund, as applicable, and therefore, we may be required to sell, distribute or otherwise dispose of investments at a disadvantageous time prior to dissolution. this would result in a lower than expected return on the investments and, perhaps, on the fund itself.
hedge fund investments are subject to numerous additional risks.
investments by our funds of hedge funds in other hedge funds, as well as investments by our credit-focused, real estate debt and other hedge funds and similar products, are subject to numerous additional risks, including the following:
•   certain of the funds in which we invest are newly established funds without any operating history or are managed by management companies or general partners who may not have as significant track records as an independent manager.
•   generally, the execution of these hedge funds' investment strategies is subject to the sole discretion of the management company or the general partner of such funds.
•   hedge funds may engage in speculative trading strategies, including short selling, which is subject to the theoretically unlimited risk of loss because there is no limit on how much the price of a security may appreciate before the short position is closed out. a fund may be subject to losses if a security lender demands return of the lent securities and an alternative lending source cannot be found or if the fund is otherwise unable to borrow securities that are necessary to hedge or cover its positions.
•   hedge funds are exposed to the risk that a counterparty will not settle a transaction in accordance with its terms and conditions because of a dispute over the terms of the contract (whether or not bona fide) or because of a credit or liquidity problem or otherwise, thus causing the fund to suffer a loss. counterparty risk is accentuated for contracts with longer maturities where events may intervene to prevent settlement, or where the fund has concentrated its transactions with a single or small group of counterparties. generally, hedge funds are not restricted from dealing with any particular counterparty or from concentrating any or all of their transactions with one counterparty. moreover, the funds' internal consideration of the creditworthiness of their counterparties may prove insufficient. the absence of a regulated market to facilitate settlement may increase the potential for losses.
•   credit risk may arise through a default by one of several large institutions that are dependent on one another to meet their liquidity or operational needs, so that a default by one institution causes a series of defaults by the other institutions. this "systemic risk" may adversely affect the financial intermediaries (such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms and exchanges) with which the hedge funds interact on a daily basis.
•   the efficacy of investment and trading strategies depend largely on the ability to establish and maintain an overall market position in a combination of financial instruments. a hedge fund's trading orders may not be executed in a timely and efficient manner due to various circumstances, including systems failures or human error. in such event, the funds might only be able to acquire some but not all of the components of the position, or if the overall position were to need adjustment, the funds might not be able to make such adjustment. as a result, the funds would not be able to achieve the market position selected by the management company or general partner of such funds, and might incur a loss in liquidating their position.
•   hedge funds are subject to risks due to potential illiquidity of assets. hedge funds may make investments or hold trading positions in markets that are volatile and which may become illiquid. timely divestiture or sale of trading positions can be impaired by decreased trading volume, increased price volatility, concentrated trading positions, limitations on the ability to transfer positions in highly specialized or structured transactions to which they may be a party, and changes in industry and government regulations. it may be impossible or costly for hedge funds to liquidate positions rapidly in order to meet margin calls, withdrawal requests or otherwise, particularly if there are other market participants seeking to dispose of similar assets at the same time or the relevant market is otherwise moving against a position or in the event of trading halts or daily price movement limits on the market or otherwise. any "gate" or similar limitation on withdrawals with respect to hedge funds may not be effective in mitigating such risk. moreover, these risks may be exacerbated for our funds of hedge funds. for example, if one of our funds of hedge funds were to invest a significant portion of its assets in two or more hedge funds that each had illiquid positions in the same issuer, the illiquidity risk for our funds of hedge funds would be compounded. for example, in 2008 many hedge funds, including some of our hedge funds, experienced significant declines in value. in many cases, these declines in value were both provoked and exacerbated by margin calls and forced selling of assets. moreover, certain of our funds of hedge funds were invested in third party hedge funds that halted redemptions in the face of illiquidity and other issues, which precluded those funds of hedge funds from receiving their capital back on request.
•   hedge fund investments are subject to risks relating to investments in commodities, futures, options and other derivatives, the prices of which are highly volatile and may be subject to the theoretically unlimited risk of loss in certain circumstances, including if the fund writes a call option. price movements of commodities, futures and options contracts and payments pursuant to swap agreements are influenced by, among other things, interest rates, changing supply and demand relationships, trade, fiscal, monetary and exchange control programs and policies of governments and national and international political and economic events and policies. the value of futures, options and swap agreements also depends upon the price of the commodities underlying them and prevailing exchange rates. in addition, hedge funds' assets are subject to the risk of the failure of any of the exchanges on which their positions trade or of their clearinghouses or counterparties. most u.s. commodities exchanges limit fluctuations in certain commodity interest prices during a single day by imposing "daily price fluctuation limits" or "daily limits," the existence of which may reduce liquidity or effectively curtail trading in particular markets.
as a result of their affiliation with us, our hedge funds may from time to time be restricted from trading in certain securities (e.g., publicly traded securities issued by our current or potential portfolio companies). this may limit their ability to acquire and/or subsequently dispose of investments in connection with transactions that would otherwise generally be permitted in the absence of such affiliation.
many of our funds depend on the services of prime brokers, custodians, counterparties, administrators and other agents to carry out certain securities and derivatives transactions. the terms of these contracts are often customized and complex, and many of these arrangements occur in markets or relate to products that are not subject to regulatory oversight, although the dodd-frank act provides for regulation of the derivatives market. in particular, some of our funds utilize prime brokerage arrangements with a relatively limited number of counterparties, which has the effect of concentrating the transaction volume (and related counterparty default risk) of these funds with these counterparties.
our funds are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these contracts defaults, either voluntarily or involuntarily, on its performance under the contract. any such default may occur suddenly and without notice to us. moreover, if a counterparty defaults, we may be unable to take action to cover our exposure, either because we lack contractual recourse or because market conditions make it difficult to take effective action. this inability could occur in times of market stress, which is when defaults are most likely to occur.
in addition, our risk management process may not accurately anticipate the impact of market stress or counterparty financial condition, and as a result, we may not have taken sufficient action to reduce our risks effectively. default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect, foresee or evaluate. in addition, concerns about, or a default by, one large participant could lead to significant liquidity problems for other participants, which may in turn expose us to significant losses.
although we have risk management processes to ensure that we are not exposed to a single counterparty for significant periods of time, given the large number and size of our funds, we often have large positions with a single counterparty. for example, most of our funds have credit lines. if the lender under one or more of those credit lines were to become insolvent, we may have difficulty replacing the credit line and one or more of our funds may face liquidity problems.
in the event of a counterparty default, particularly a default by a major investment bank or a default by a counterparty to a significant number of our contracts, one or more of our funds may have outstanding trades that they cannot settle or are delayed in settling. as a result, these funds could incur material losses and the resulting market impact of a major counterparty default could harm our businesses, results of operation and financial condition.
in the event of the insolvency of a prime broker, custodian, counterparty or any other party that is holding assets of our funds as collateral, our funds might not be able to recover equivalent assets in full as they will rank among the prime broker's, custodian's or counterparty's unsecured creditors in relation to the assets held as collateral. in addition, our funds' cash held with a prime broker, custodian or counterparty generally will not be segregated from the prime broker's, custodian's or counterparty's own cash, and our funds may therefore rank as unsecured creditors in relation thereto. if our derivatives transactions are cleared through a derivatives clearing organization, the cftc has issued final rules regulating the segregation and protection of collateral posted by customers of cleared and uncleared swaps. the cftc is also working to provide new guidance regarding prime broker arrangements and intermediation generally with regard to trading on swap execution facilities.
the counterparty risks that we face have increased in complexity and magnitude as a result of disruption in the financial markets in recent years. for example, in certain areas the number of counterparties we face has increased and may continue to increase, which may result in increased complexity and monitoring costs. conversely, in certain other areas, the consolidation and elimination of counterparties has increased our concentration of counterparty risk and decreased the universe of potential counterparties, and our funds are generally not restricted from dealing with any particular counterparty or from concentrating any or all of their transactions with one counterparty. in addition, counterparties have in the past and may in the future react to market volatility by tightening underwriting standards and increasing margin requirements for all categories of financing, which may decrease the overall amount of leverage available and increase the costs of borrowing.
underwriting activities by our capital markets services business expose us to risks.
blackstone advisory partners l.p. may act as an underwriter, syndicator or placement agent in securities offerings and, through affiliated entities, loan syndications. we may incur losses and be subject to reputational harm to the extent that, for any reason, we are unable to sell securities or indebtedness we purchased or placed as an underwriter, syndicator or placement agent at the anticipated price levels or at all. as an underwriter, syndicator or placement agent, we also may be subject to liability for material misstatements or omissions in prospectuses and other offering documents relating to offerings we underwrite, syndicate or place.
risks related to our organizational structure our class a common stock is not entitled to vote in the election of our directors.
although holders of our class a common stock are entitled to vote on a number of matters, our class c common stock, currently held by blackstone group management l.l.c., is the only class of our common stock that is entitled to vote for the election of our directors. as a result, holders of our class a common stock do not have an opportunity to vote for the election of our directors or on other matters that have not been provided for in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws or otherwise required by delaware law. in addition, on the matters that are required to be submitted for a vote of holders of our class a common stock our certificate of incorporation generally provides for holders of our class a common stock to vote together with the holders of our class b common stock as a single class. see "- blackstone personnel effectively control us and will effectively be able to determine the outcome of matters that may be submitted for a vote of holders of our class a common stock."
the voting rights of holders of our class a common stock are further restricted by provisions in our certificate of incorporation stating that any of our shares of stock held by a person that beneficially owns 20% or more of the class a common stock then outstanding (other than the class c shareholder or its affiliates, a direct or subsequently approved transferee of the class c shareholder or its affiliates or a person or group that has acquired such stock with the prior approval of our board of directors) cannot be voted on any matter. our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws also contain provisions limiting the ability of the holders of our class a common stock to call meetings, to acquire information about our operations and to influence the manner or direction of our management.
as a result, holders of our class a common stock will have very limited or no ability to influence shareholder decisions, including decisions regarding our business.
we are not required to comply with certain provisions of u.s. securities laws relating to proxy statements, shareholder proposals and other matters.
although our class a common stock is entitled to vote on a number of matters, it is not entitled to vote in the election of our directors. as a result, the shareholder approval requirements of the new york stock exchange generally do not apply to us. accordingly, we are not required to file proxy statements or information statements under section 14 of the exchange act except in those limited circumstances where a vote of holders of our class a common stock is required under our certificate of incorporation or delaware law. accordingly, holders of class a common stock will not receive these materials. in addition, we are not subject to the "say-on-pay" and "say-on-frequency" provisions of the dodd-frank act. as a result, our class a common shareholders do not have an opportunity to provide a non-binding vote on the compensation of our named executive officers. moreover, holders of our class a common stock are not able to bring matters before our annual meeting of shareholders or nominate directors at such meeting, nor are they generally able to submit shareholder proposals under rule 14a-8 of the exchange act.
blackstone personnel effectively control us and will effectively be able to determine the outcome of matters that may be submitted for a vote of the holders of our class a common stock.
while our class a common stock is entitled to vote on a number of matters, our certificate of incorporation generally provides for holders of our class a common stock to vote on these matters together with the holders of our class b common stock as a single class. specifically, the removal of the class c shareholder and forced transfer by the class c shareholder of its shares of class c common stock requires the approval of at least two-thirds of the voting power of our outstanding shares of class a common stock and class b common stock, voting together as a single class. other matters that are required to be submitted to a vote of the holders of our class a common stock generally require the approval of a majority the voting power of our outstanding shares of class a common stock and class b common stock, voting together as a single class, including certain sales, exchanges or other dispositions of all or substantially all of our assets, a merger, consolidation or other business combination, certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and the designation of a successor class c shareholder. holders of our class b common stock, as such, will collectively be entitled to a number of votes equal to the aggregate number of blackstone holdings partnership units held by the limited partners of the blackstone holdings partnerships on the relevant record date and will vote together with holders of our class a common stock as a single class. as of december 31, 2019, blackstone partners l.l.c., an entity owned by the senior managing directors of blackstone and controlled by mr. schwarzman, owned the only share of class b common stock outstanding, representing approximately 43.6% of the total combined voting power of the class a common stock and class b common stock, taken together. this voting power may be sufficient to substantially influence matters subject to a vote of the class a common stock and the class b common stock, including amendments that could materially and adversely affect the holders of our class a common stock.
in addition, holders of our class a common stock are not entitled to vote in the election of our directors. as a result, holders of our class a common stock may be deprived of an opportunity to receive a premium for their class a common stock in the future through a sale of blackstone, and the trading prices of our class a common stock may be adversely affected by the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price. see "- our class a common stock is not entitled to vote in the election of our directors."
we are a controlled company and as a result fall within exceptions from certain corporate governance and other requirements under the rules of the new york stock exchange.
we are a "controlled company" and fall within exceptions from certain corporate governance and other requirements of the rules of the new york stock exchange. pursuant to these exceptions, controlled companies may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements of the new york stock exchange, including the requirements (a) that a majority of our board of directors consist of independent directors, (b) that we have a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors (c) that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors, and (d) that the compensation committee be required to consider certain independence factors when engaging compensation consultants, legal counsel and other committee advisers. while we currently have a majority independent board of directors, we have elected to avail ourselves of the other exceptions. accordingly, our class a common shareholders generally do not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the nyse.
blackstone group management l.l.c., an entity owned by senior managing directors of blackstone and controlled by mr. schwarzman, is the sole holder of the class c common stock. as a result, conflicts of interest may arise among the class c shareholder, on the one hand, and us and our holders of our class a common stock, on the other hand.
the class c shareholder has the ability to influence our business and affairs through its ownership of the sole share of voting stock of blackstone, the class c shareholder's general ability to appoint our board of directors, and provisions under our certificate of incorporation requiring class c shareholder approval for certain corporate actions (in addition to approval by our board of directors). if the holders of our class a common stock are dissatisfied with the performance of our board of directors, they have no ability to remove any of our directors, with or without cause.
further, through its ability to elect our board of directors, the class c shareholder has the ability to indirectly influence the determination of the amount and timing of our investments and dispositions, cash expenditures, indebtedness, issuances of additional partnership interests, tax liabilities and amounts of reserves, each of which can affect the amount of cash that is available for distribution to holders of blackstone holdings partnership units.
in addition, conflicts may arise relating to the selection, structuring and disposition of investments and other transactions, declaring dividends and other distributions and other matters due to the fact that our senior managing directors hold their blackstone holdings partnership units directly or through pass-through entities that are not subject to corporate income taxation. see "part iii. item 13. certain relationships and related transactions, and director independence" and "part iii. item 10. directors, executive officers and corporate governance."
our certificate of incorporation states that the class c shareholder is under no obligation to consider the separate interests of the other shareholders and contains provisions limiting the liability of the class c shareholder.
subject to applicable law, our certificate of incorporation contains provisions limiting the duties owed by the holder of our class c common stock, which is the only class of our common stock entitled to vote for the election of our directors, and contains provisions allowing the class c shareholder to favor its own interests and the interests of its controlling persons over us and the holders of our class a common stock. our certificate of incorporation contains provisions stating that the class c shareholder is under no obligation to consider the separate interests of the other shareholders (including, without limitation, the tax consequences to such shareholders) in deciding whether or not to authorize us to take (or decline to authorize us to take) any action as well as provisions stating that the class c shareholder shall not be liable to the other shareholders for damages for any losses, liabilities or benefits not derived by such shareholders in connection with such decisions. see "- potential conflicts of interest may arise among the class c shareholder and the holders of our class a common stock."
the class c shareholder will not be liable to blackstone or holders of our class a common stock for any acts or omissions unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment determining that the class c shareholder acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct and we have also agreed to indemnify the class c shareholder to a similar extent.
even if there is deemed to be a breach of the obligations set forth in our certificate of incorporation, our certificate of incorporation provides that the class c shareholder will not be liable to us or the holders of our class a common stock for any acts or omissions unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that the class c shareholder or its officers and directors acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct. these provisions are detrimental to the holders of our class a common stock because they restrict the remedies available to shareholders for actions of the class c shareholder.
in addition, we have agreed to indemnify the class c shareholder and our former general partner and its controlling affiliates and any current or former officer or director of any of blackstone or its subsidiaries, the class c shareholder or former general partner and certain other specified persons (collectively, the "indemnitees"), to the fullest extent permitted by law, against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses (including legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, penalties, interest, settlements or other amounts incurred by any indemnitee. we have agreed to provide this indemnification if the indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner the indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and with respect to any alleged conduct resulting in a criminal proceeding against the indemnitee, such person had no reasonable cause to believe that such person's conduct was unlawful. we have also agreed to provide this indemnification for criminal proceedings.
the class c shareholder may transfer its interest in the sole share of class c common stock which could materially alter our operations.
without the approval of any other shareholder, the class c shareholder may transfer the sole outstanding share of our class c common stock held by it to a third party upon receipt of approval to do so by our board of directors and satisfaction of certain other requirements. further, the members or other interest holders of the class c shareholder may sell or transfer all or part of their outstanding equity or other interests in the class c shareholder at any time without our approval. a new holder of our class c common stock or new controlling members of the class c shareholder may appoint directors to our board of directors who have a different philosophy and/or investment objectives from those of our current directors. a new holder of our class c common stock, new controlling members of the class c shareholder and/or the directors they appoint to our board of directors could also have a different philosophy for the management of our business, including the hiring and compensation of our investment professionals. if any of the foregoing were to occur, we could experience difficulty in forming new funds and other investment vehicles and in making new investments, and the value of our existing investments, our business, our results of operations and our financial condition could materially suffer.
we intend to pay regular dividends to holders of our class a common stock, but our ability to do so may be limited by cash flow from operations and available liquidity, our holding company structure, applicable provisions of delaware law and contractual restrictions.
our intention to pay to holders of class a common stock a quarterly dividend representing approximately 85% of the blackstone group inc.'s share of distributable earnings, subject to adjustment by amounts determined by blackstone's board of directors to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the conduct of its business, to make appropriate investments in its business and our funds, to comply with applicable law, any of its debt instruments or other agreements, or to provide for future cash requirements such as tax-related payments, clawback obligations and dividends to shareholders for any ensuing quarter. all of the foregoing is subject to the qualification that the declaration and payment of any dividends are at the sole discretion of our board of directors, and may change at any time, including, without limitation, to eliminate such dividends entirely.
the blackstone group inc. is a holding company and has no material assets other than the ownership of the partnership units in blackstone holdings held through wholly owned subsidiaries. the blackstone group inc. has no independent means of generating revenue. accordingly, we intend to cause blackstone holdings to make distributions to its partners, including the blackstone group inc.'s wholly owned subsidiaries, to fund any dividends the blackstone group inc. may declare on our class a common stock.
our ability to make dividends to our shareholders will depend on a number of factors, including among others general economic and business conditions, our strategic plans and prospects, our business and investment opportunities, our financial condition and operating results, including the timing and extent of our realizations, working capital requirements and anticipated cash needs, contractual restrictions and obligations including fulfilling our current and future capital commitments, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions, restrictions and other implications on the payment of dividends by us to holders of our class a common stock or payment of distributions by our subsidiaries to us and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant. our ability to pay dividends is also subject to the availability of lawful funds therefor as determined in accordance with the delaware general corporation law.
the amortization of finite-lived intangible assets and non-cash equity-based compensation results in expenses that may increase the net loss we record in certain periods or cause us to record a net loss in periods during which we would otherwise have recorded net income.
as of december 31, 2019, we have $397.5 million of finite-lived intangible assets (in addition to $1.9 billion of goodwill), net of accumulated amortization. these finite-lived intangible assets are from the initial public offering ("ipo") and subsequent business acquisitions. we are amortizing these finite-lived intangibles over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to twenty years, using the straight-line method, with a weighted-average remaining amortization period of 7.9 years as of december 31, 2019. we also record non-cash equity-based compensation from grants made in the ordinary course of business and in connection with other business acquisitions. the amortization of these finite-lived intangible assets and of this non-cash equity-based compensation will increase our expenses during the relevant periods. these expenses may increase the net loss we record in certain periods or cause us to record a net loss in periods during which we would otherwise have recorded net income. a substantial and sustained decline in our share price could result in an impairment of intangible assets or goodwill leading to a further reduction in net income or increase to net loss in the relevant period.
we are required to pay our senior managing directors for most of the benefits relating to any additional tax depreciation or amortization deductions we may claim as a result of the tax basis step-up we received as part of the reorganization we implemented in connection with our ipo or receive in connection with future exchanges of our class a common stock and related transactions.
as part of the reorganization we implemented in connection with our ipo, we purchased interests in our business from our pre-ipo owners. in addition, holders of partnership units in blackstone holdings (other than the blackstone group inc.'s wholly owned subsidiaries), subject to the vesting and minimum retained ownership requirements and transfer restrictions set forth in the partnership agreements of the blackstone holdings partnerships, may up to four times each year (subject to the terms of the exchange agreement) exchange their blackstone holdings partnership units for shares of the blackstone group inc.'s class a common stock on a one-for-one basis. a blackstone holdings limited partner must exchange one partnership unit in each of the blackstone holdings partnerships to effect an exchange for a share of common stock. the purchase and subsequent exchanges are expected to result in increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of blackstone holdings that otherwise would not have been available. these increases in tax basis may increase (for tax purposes) depreciation and amortization and therefore reduce the amount of tax that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future, although the irs may challenge all or part of that tax basis increase, and a court could sustain such a challenge.
we have entered into a tax receivable agreement with our senior managing directors and other pre-ipo owners that provides for the payment by us to the counterparties of 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in u.s. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that we actually realize as a result of these increases in tax basis and of certain other tax benefits related to entering into the tax receivable agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement. in addition, additional tax receivable agreements have been executed, and others may continue to be executed, with newly-admitted blackstone senior managing directors and certain others who receive blackstone holdings partnership units. this payment obligation is an obligation of the blackstone group inc. and/or its wholly owned subsidiaries and not of blackstone holdings. as such, the cash distributions to public shareholders may vary from holders of blackstone holdings partnership units (held by blackstone personnel and others) to the extent payments are made under the tax receivable agreements to selling holders of blackstone holdings partnership units. as the payments reflect actual tax savings received by blackstone entities, there may be a timing difference between the tax savings received by blackstone entities and the cash payments to selling holders of blackstone holdings partnership units. while the actual increase in tax basis, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under this agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of exchanges, the price of our class a common stock at the time of the exchange, the extent to which such exchanges are taxable and the amount and timing of our income, we expect that as a result of the size of the increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of blackstone holdings, the payments that we may make under the tax receivable agreements will be substantial. the payments under a tax receivable agreement are not conditioned upon a tax receivable agreement counterparty's continued ownership of us. we may need to incur debt to finance payments under the tax receivable agreement to the extent our cash resources are insufficient to meet our obligations under the tax receivable agreements as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise.
although we are not aware of any issue that would cause the irs to challenge a tax basis increase, the tax receivable agreement counterparties will not reimburse us for any payments previously made under the tax receivable agreement. as a result, in certain circumstances payments to the counterparties under the tax receivable agreement could be in excess of our actual cash tax savings. our ability to achieve benefits from any tax basis increase, and the payments to be made under the tax receivable agreements, will depend upon a number of factors, as discussed above, including the timing and amount of our future income.
if the blackstone group inc. were deemed an "investment company" under the 1940 act, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business.
an entity will generally be deemed to be an "investment company" for purposes of the 1940 act if: (a) it is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities, or (b) absent an applicable exemption, it owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets (exclusive of u.s. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. we believe that we are engaged primarily in the business of providing asset management and capital markets services and not in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. we also believe that the primary source of income from each of our businesses is properly characterized as income earned in exchange for the provision of services. we hold ourselves out as an asset management and capital markets firm and do not propose to engage primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. accordingly, we do not believe that the blackstone group inc. is an "orthodox" investment company as defined in section 3(a)(1)(a) of the 1940 act and described in clause (a) in the first sentence of this paragraph. furthermore, the blackstone group inc. does not have any material assets other than its equity interests in certain wholly owned subsidiaries, which in turn will have no material assets (other than intercompany debt) other than general partner interests in the blackstone holdings partnerships. these wholly owned subsidiaries are the sole general partners of the blackstone holdings partnerships and are vested with all management and control over the blackstone holdings partnerships. we do not believe the equity interests of the blackstone group inc. in its wholly owned subsidiaries or the general partner interests of these wholly owned subsidiaries in the blackstone holdings partnerships are investment securities. moreover, because we believe that the capital interests of the general partners of our funds in their respective funds are neither securities nor investment securities, we believe that less than 40% of the blackstone group inc.'s total assets (exclusive of u.s. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis are comprised of assets that could be considered investment securities. accordingly, we do not believe the blackstone group inc. is an inadvertent investment company by virtue of the 40% test in section 3(a)(1)(c) of the 1940 act as described in clause (b) in the first sentence of this paragraph. in addition, we believe the blackstone group inc. is not an investment company under section 3(b)(1) of the 1940 act because it is primarily engaged in a non-investment company business.
the 1940 act and the rules thereunder contain detailed parameters for the organization and operation of investment companies. among other things, the 1940 act and the rules thereunder limit or prohibit transactions with affiliates, impose limitations on the issuance of debt and equity securities, generally prohibit the issuance of options and impose certain governance requirements. we intend to conduct our operations so that the blackstone group inc. will not be deemed to be an investment company under the 1940 act. if anything were to happen which would cause the blackstone group inc. to be deemed to be an investment company under the 1940 act, requirements imposed by the 1940 act, including limitations on our capital structure, ability to transact business with affiliates (including us) and ability to compensate key employees, could make it impractical for us to continue our business as currently conducted, impair the agreements and arrangements between and among the blackstone group inc., blackstone holdings and our senior managing directors, or any combination thereof, and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, we may be required to limit the amount of investments that we make as a principal or otherwise conduct our business in a manner that does not subject us to the registration and other requirements of the 1940 act.
we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the conversion or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected or not offset the costs of the conversion, which could have a material and adverse impact on the trading price of our securities.
we believe that the conversion has, among other things, made it significantly easier for both domestic and international investors to own our stock, expand our global investor base and drive greater value for all of our shareholders over time. however, over time, the level of investor interest in our class a common stock may not meet our expectations. for example, benchmark stock indices may change their eligibility requirements in a manner that is adverse to us or otherwise determine not to include our class a common stock. moreover, even though we have simplified our tax structure and reporting as a result of the conversion, and even if we succeed in having our shares included in additional key stock indices, this may not result in the sustained increased demand for our class a common stock that we initially anticipated. consequently, we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the conversion or those benefits may take longer to realize than we expect. moreover, there can be no assurance that the anticipated benefits of the conversion will offset its costs, which could be greater than we expect, particularly if there were to be an increase in the u.s. federal corporate income tax rate. our failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the conversion at all or in a timely manner, or a failure of any benefits realized to offset its costs, could have a material and adverse impact on the trading price of our securities.
we may from time to time undertake internal reorganizations that may adversely impact our business and results of operations.
on july 1, 2019, we completed the conversion. from time to time, we may undertake other internal reorganizations in an effort to simplify our organizational structure, streamline our operations or for other operational reasons. such internal reorganization may involve, among other things, the combination or dissolution of certain of our existing subsidiaries and the creation of new subsidiaries. these transactions could be disruptive to our business, result in significant expense, require regulatory approvals, and fail to result in the intended or expected benefits, any of which could adversely impact our business and results of operations.
other anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents could delay or prevent a change in control.
in addition to the provisions described elsewhere relating to the class c shareholder's control, other provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable by, for example:
•   permitting our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock;
•   providing for the loss of voting rights for the class a common stock;
•   requiring advance notice for shareholder proposals and nominations if they are ever permitted by applicable law;
•   placing limitations on convening shareholder meetings;
•   prohibiting shareholder action by written consent unless such action is consent to by the class c shareholder; and
•   imposing super-majority voting requirements for certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation.
these provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control.
since our conversion, all of the net income attributable to us is subject to u.s. federal (and state and local) corporate income taxes, which we anticipate will have a dilutive impact to distributable earnings per share of class a common stock and net income attributable to us and reduce the amount of cash available for dividends to our class a common shareholders, although this dilution should initially be mitigated by a tax basis step-up related to the conversion. the currently enacted maximum u.s. federal corporate income tax rate is 21%. this rate may increase in the future, which would cause us to pay more corporate income taxes than currently anticipated.
because all of the blackstone group inc.'s net income is subject to corporate income taxes, we expect the amount of our cash tax savings from future exchanges of blackstone holdings partnership units for shares of class a common stock to increase as compared to the cash tax savings historically realized by the partnership from such exchanges for common units. as a result, we expect the amount the corporation will be required to pay under the tax receivable agreement (i.e., 85% of cash tax savings it realizes) will in the aggregate over time be higher for exchanges following the conversion. this would similarly have the effect of increasing the amount of any early termination payment or the amounts due upon the occurrence of an acceleration event, which are determined in part by reference to amounts payable in respect of future exchanges.
risks related to our common stock our class a common stock price may decline due to the large number of shares of class a common stock eligible for future sale and for exchange.
the market price of our class a common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of class a common stock in the market in the future or the perception that such sales could occur. these sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell shares of class a common stock in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. we had a total of 673,609,987 shares of class a common stock outstanding as of february 21, 2020. subject to the lock-up restrictions described below, we may issue and sell in the future additional shares of class a common stock. limited partners of blackstone holdings owned an aggregate of 470,859,228 blackstone holdings partnership units outstanding as of february 21, 2020. in connection with our initial public offering, we entered into an exchange agreement with holders of blackstone holdings partnership units (other than the blackstone group inc.'s wholly owned subsidiaries) so that these holders, subject to the vesting and minimum retained ownership requirements and transfer restrictions set forth in the partnership agreements of the blackstone holdings partnerships, may up to four times each year (subject to the terms of the exchange agreement) exchange their blackstone holdings partnership units for shares of the blackstone group inc. class a common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for splits, unit distributions and reclassifications. a blackstone holdings limited partner must exchange one partnership unit in each of the blackstone holdings partnerships to effect an exchange for a share of class a common stock. the class a common stock we issue upon such exchanges would be "restricted securities," as defined in rule 144 under the securities act, unless we register such issuances. however, we have entered into a registration rights agreement with the limited partners of blackstone holdings that requires us to register these shares of class a common stock under the securities act and we have filed registration statements that cover the delivery of class a common stock issued upon exchange of blackstone holdings partnership units. see "part iii. item 13. certain relationships and related transactions, and director independence - transactions with related persons - registration rights agreement." while the partnership agreements of the blackstone holdings partnerships and related agreements contractually restrict the ability of blackstone personnel to transfer the blackstone holdings partnership units or the blackstone group inc. class a common stock they hold and require that they maintain a minimum amount of equity ownership during their employ by us, these contractual provisions may lapse over time or be waived, modified or amended at any time.
as of february 21, 2020, we had granted 16,483,918 outstanding deferred restricted shares of class a common stock and 34,874,324 outstanding deferred restricted blackstone holdings partnership units to our non-senior managing director professionals and senior managing directors under the blackstone group inc. 2007 amended and restated 2007 equity incentive plan ("2007 equity incentive plan"). the aggregate number of shares of class a common stock and blackstone holdings partnership units (together, "shares") covered by our 2007 equity incentive plan is increased on the first day of each fiscal year during its term by a number of shares equal to the positive difference, if any, of (a) 15% of the aggregate number of shares outstanding on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year (excluding blackstone holdings partnership units held by the blackstone group inc. or its wholly owned subsidiaries) minus (b) the aggregate number of shares covered by our 2007 equity incentive plan as of such date (unless the administrator of the 2007 equity incentive plan should decide to increase the number of shares covered by the plan by a lesser amount). an aggregate of 168,989,929 additional shares were available for grant under our 2007 equity incentive plan as of february 21, 2020. we have filed a registration statement and intend to file additional registration statements on form s-8 under the securities act to register class a common stock covered by the 2007 equity incentive plan (including pursuant to automatic annual increases). any such form s-8 registration statement will automatically become effective upon filing. accordingly, class a common stock registered under such registration statement will be available for sale in the open market.
in addition, the blackstone holdings partnership agreements authorize the wholly owned subsidiaries of the blackstone group inc. which are the general partners of those partnerships to issue an unlimited number of additional partnership securities of the blackstone holdings partnerships with such designations, preferences, rights, powers and duties that are different from, and may be senior to, those applicable to the blackstone holdings partnership units, and which may be exchangeable for our shares of class a common stock.
the market price of our class a common stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of your investment to decline.
securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations. this market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, could reduce the market price of class a common stock in spite of our operating performance. in addition, our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors, and in response the market price of our class a common stock could decrease significantly. you may be unable to resell your class a common stock at or above the price you paid for them.
our certificate of incorporation also provides us with a right to acquire all of the then outstanding shares of class a common stock under specified circumstances, which may adversely affect the price of our shares of class a common stock and the ability of holders of shares of class a common stock to participate in further growth in our stock price.
our certificate of incorporation provides that, if at any time, less than 10% of the total shares of any class our stock then outstanding (other than class b common stock and class c common stock) is held by persons other than the class c shareholder and its affiliates, we may exercise our right to call and purchase all of the then outstanding shares of class a common stock held by persons other than the class c shareholder or its affiliates or assign this right to the class c shareholder or any of its affiliates. as a result, a shareholder may have his or her shares of class a common stock purchased from him or her at an undesirable time or price and in a manner which adversely affects the ability of a shareholder to participate in further growth in our stock price.

in addition, our credit segment includes our publicly traded master limited partnership ("mlp") investment platform, which is managed by harvest. harvest primarily invests capital raised from institutional investors in separately managed accounts and pooled vehicles, investing in publicly traded mlps holding primarily midstream energy assets in the u.s.
our insurer-focused platform, bis, also a part of our credit segment, partners with insurers to deliver customized and diversified portfolios of blackstone products across asset classes, including the option for full management of insurance companies' investment portfolios.
we generate revenue from fees earned pursuant to contractual arrangements with funds, fund investors and fund portfolio companies (including management, transaction and monitoring fees), and from capital markets services. we also invest in the funds we manage and we are entitled to a pro-rata share of the results of the fund (a "pro-rata allocation"). in addition to a pro-rata  allocation, and assuming certain investment returns are achieved, we are entitled to a disproportionate allocation of the income otherwise allocable to the limited partners, commonly referred to as carried interest ("performance allocations"). in certain structures, we receive a contractual incentive fee from an investment fund in the event that specified cumulative investment returns are achieved (an "incentive fee", and together with performance allocations, "performance revenues"). the composition of our revenues will vary based on market conditions and the cyclicality of the different businesses in which we operate. net investment gains and investment income generated by the blackstone funds are driven by value created by our operating and strategic initiatives as well as overall market conditions. fair values are affected by changes in the fundamentals of our portfolio company and other investments, the industries in which they operate, the overall economy and other market conditions.
business environment blackstone's businesses are materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions in the u.s., europe, asia and, to a lesser extent, elsewhere in the world.
2019 was characterized by rising global markets and continued economic expansion, despite uncertainty related to trade disputes, geopolitical risks, and yield curve inversions in the u.s. and around the world.
in the u.s., the s&p 500 increased 29% in 2019. global and regional equity indices also appreciated in 2019, with the msci world index rising 25% and the msci europe index up 22%. the msci asia and emerging markets indices trailed slightly, but still finished the year up 16% and 15%, respectively.
all of the major u.s. equity market sectors posted positive returns in 2019, with particular strength in technology stocks, which were up 48% for 2019. energy stocks lagged the overall market, ending the year up only 8%. the price of west texas intermediate crude oil increased 34% in 2019 to $61 per barrel, but declined to $51 in early 2020, while the henry hub natural gas spot price declined 36% in 2019 to $2.09, and declined further to $1.94 in early 2020. spot prices for other commodities were mixed, and the bloomberg commodity index increased 5% in 2019.
in fixed income, dovish u.s. monetary policy drove government bond yields lower as the u.s. federal reserve lowered the federal funds target range in three rate cuts to 1.5%-1.75%, noting that the current level would likely be held steady for the foreseeable future given an outlook for moderate economic growth, a strong labor market and low inflation. ten-year u.s. treasury yields declined 77 basis points to 1.92% in 2019, and declined another 55 basis points to 1.37% in early 2020. the bloomberg barclays u.s. aggregate index rose 9% and the credit suisse u.s. high-yield index advanced 14% in 2019. high-yield spreads contracted 161 basis points in 2019, while issuance increased 62% year-over-year.
volatility moderated slightly in 2019, with the vix index averaging 15.4, down 5% from the 2018 average, and ending the year at 13.8. global equity issuance was fairly steady, down 1% in 2019. merger and acquisition (m&a) activity was also fairly steady, with global announced m&a volumes down 1% in 2019.
the industrial sector remains soft, as industrial production declined 0.9% in the fourth quarter from the year-ago period. the institute for supply management manufacturing purchasing managers' index also declined in the fourth quarter to the lowest level since june 2009, signaling ongoing contraction in the u.s. manufacturing sector.
the u.s. continues to experience low unemployment, with a jobless rate of 3.5% - the lowest level since december 1969. wage growth continued in the fourth quarter, with average hourly earnings increasing 3.3% year-over-year, based on the three-month average for production and nonsupervisory employees. although the growth rate moderated from the third quarter of 2019, it remains elevated.
the global growth cycle is in a mature phase and signs of slowdown are evident in certain regions around the world, although most economists continue to expect moderate economic growth in the near term, with limited signals of an imminent recession in the u.s. as consumer and government spending remain healthy. although the broader outlook remains constructive and progress was made on trade, including a phase one deal with china and the united states-mexico-canada agreement, geopolitical instability continues to pose risk. in particular, the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus in many countries, which is a rapidly evolving situation, has disrupted global travel and supply chains, and has adversely impacted global commercial activity and a number of industries, such as transportation, hospitality and entertainment. the rapid development and fluidity of this situation precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact of the novel coronavirus, which may have a continued adverse impact on economic and market conditions and trigger a period of global economic slowdown.

key financial measures and indicators we manage our business using certain financial measures and key operating metrics since we believe these metrics measure the productivity of our investment activities. we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap. see "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - note 2. summary of significant accounting policies" and "- critical accounting policies." our key non-gaap financial measures and operating indicators and metrics are discussed below.
distributable earnings distributable earnings is derived from blackstone's segment reported results. distributable earnings is used to assess performance and amounts available for dividends to blackstone shareholders, including blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of the blackstone holdings partnerships. distributable earnings is the sum of segment distributable earnings plus net interest income (loss) less taxes and related payables. distributable earnings excludes unrealized activity and is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable gaap measure of income (loss) before provision (benefit) for taxes. see "- non-gaap financial measures" for our reconciliation of distributable earnings.
net interest income (loss) is presented on a segment basis and is equal to interest and dividend revenue less interest expense, adjusted for the impact of consolidation of blackstone funds, and interest expense associated with the tax receivable agreement.
taxes and related payables represent the total gaap tax provision adjusted to include only the current tax provision (benefit) calculated on income (loss) before provision (benefit) for taxes excluding the tax impact of any divestitures and including the payable under the tax receivable agreement.
segment distributable earnings segment distributable earnings is blackstone's segment profitability measure used to make operating decisions and assess performance across blackstone's four segments. segment distributable earnings represents the net realized earnings of blackstone's segments and is the sum of fee related earnings and net realizations for each segment. blackstone's segments are presented on a basis that deconsolidates blackstone funds, eliminates non-controlling ownership interests in blackstone's consolidated operating partnerships, removes the amortization of intangible assets and removes transaction-related charges. transaction-related charges arise from corporate actions including acquisitions, divestitures and blackstone's initial public offering. they consist primarily of equity-based compensation charges, gains and losses on contingent consideration arrangements, changes in the balance of the tax receivable agreement resulting from a change in tax law or similar event, transaction costs and any gains or losses associated with these corporate actions. segment distributable earnings excludes unrealized activity and is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable gaap measure of income (loss) before provision (benefit) for taxes. see "- non-gaap  financial measures" for our reconciliation of segment distributable earnings.
net realizations is presented on a segment basis and is the sum of realized principal investment income and realized performance revenues (which refers to realized performance revenues excluding fee related performance revenues), less realized performance compensation (which refers to realized performance compensation excluding fee related performance compensation and equity-based performance compensation).
fee related earnings fee related earnings is a performance measure used to assess blackstone's ability to generate profits from revenues that are measured and received on a recurring basis and not subject to future realization events. fee related earnings equals management and advisory fees (net of management fee reductions and offsets) plus fee related performance revenues, less (a) fee related compensation on a segment basis, and (b) other operating expenses. fee related earnings is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable gaap measure of income (loss) before provision (benefit) for taxes. see "- non-gaap financial measures" for our reconciliation of fee related earnings.
fee related compensation is presented on a segment basis and refers to the compensation expense, excluding equity-based compensation, directly related to (a) management and advisory fees, net and (b) fee related performance revenues, referred to as fee related performance compensation.
fee related performance revenues refers to the realized portion of performance revenues from perpetual capital that are (a) measured and received on a recurring basis, and (b) not dependent on realization events from the underlying investments.
adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization ("adjusted ebitda"), is a supplemental measure used to assess performance derived from blackstone's segment results and may be used to assess its ability to service its borrowings. adjusted ebitda represents distributable earnings plus the addition of (a) interest expense on a segment basis, (b) taxes and related payables, and (c) depreciation and amortization. adjusted ebitda is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable gaap measure of income (loss) before provision (benefit) for taxes. see "- non-gaap financial measures" for our reconciliation of adjusted ebitda.
operating metrics the alternative asset management business is primarily based on managing third party capital and does not require substantial capital investment to support rapid growth. since our inception, we have developed and used various key operating metrics to assess and monitor the operating performance of our various alternative asset management businesses in order to monitor the effectiveness of our value creating strategies.
assets under management. assets under management refers to the assets we manage. our assets under management equals the sum of:
(a)   the fair value of the investments held by our carry funds and our side-by-side and co-investment entities managed by us, plus (1) the capital that we are entitled to call from investors in those funds and entities pursuant to the terms of their respective capital commitments, including capital commitments to funds that have yet to commence their investment periods, or (2) for certain credit-focused funds the amounts available to be borrowed under asset based credit facilities,
(b)   the net asset value of (1) our hedge funds and real estate debt carry funds, bpp, certain co-investments managed by us, certain credit-focused funds, and our hedge fund solutions drawdown funds (plus, in each case, the capital that we are entitled to call from investors in those funds, including commitments yet to commence their investment periods), and (2) our funds of hedge funds, our hedge fund solutions registered investment companies, and breit,
(c)   the invested capital, fair value or net asset value of assets we manage pursuant to separately managed accounts,
(d)   the amount of debt and equity outstanding for our clos during the reinvestment period,
(e)   the aggregate par amount of collateral assets, including principal cash, for our clos after the reinvestment period,
(f)   the gross or net amount of assets (including leverage where applicable) for our credit-focused registered investment companies, and
(g)   the fair value of common stock, preferred stock, convertible debt, or similar instruments issued by bxmt.
our carry funds are commitment-based drawdown structured funds that do not permit investors to redeem their interests at their election. our funds of hedge funds, hedge funds, funds structured like hedge funds and other open-ended funds in our hedge fund solutions, credit and real estate segments generally have structures that afford an investor the right to withdraw or redeem their interests on a periodic basis (for example, annually or quarterly), typically with 30 to 95 days' notice, depending on the fund and the liquidity profile of the underlying assets. investment advisory agreements related to certain separately managed accounts in our hedge fund solutions and credit segments, excluding our bis separately managed accounts, may generally be terminated by an investor on 30 to 90 days' notice.
fee-earning assets under management. fee-earning assets under management refers to the assets we manage on which we derive management fees and/or performance revenues. our fee-earning assets under management equals the sum of:
(a)   for our private equity segment funds and real estate segment carry funds, including certain breds and hedge fund solutions funds, the amount of capital commitments, remaining invested capital, fair value, net asset value or par value of assets held, depending on the fee terms of the fund,
(b)   for our credit-focused carry funds, the amount of remaining invested capital (which may include leverage) or net asset value, depending on the fee terms of the fund,
(c)   the remaining invested capital or fair value of assets held in co-investment vehicles managed by us on which we receive fees,
(d)   the net asset value of our funds of hedge funds, hedge funds, bpp, certain co-investments managed by us, certain registered investment companies, breit, and certain of our hedge fund solutions drawdown funds,
(e)   the invested capital, fair value of assets or the net asset value we manage pursuant to separately managed accounts,
(f)   the net proceeds received from equity offerings and accumulated core earnings of bxmt, subject to certain adjustments,
(g)   the aggregate par amount of collateral assets, including principal cash, of our clos, and
(h)   the gross amount of assets (including leverage) or the net assets (plus leverage where applicable) for certain of our credit-focused registered investment companies.
each of our segments may include certain fee-earning assets under management on which we earn performance revenues but not management fees.
our calculations of assets under management and fee-earning assets under management may differ from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers. in addition, our calculation of assets under management includes commitments to, and the fair value of, invested capital in our funds from blackstone and our personnel, regardless of whether such commitments or invested capital are subject to fees. our definitions of assets under management and fee-earning assets under management are not based on any definition of assets under management and fee-earning assets under management that is set forth in the agreements governing the investment funds that we manage.
for our carry funds, total assets under management includes the fair value of the investments held and uncalled capital commitments, whereas fee-earning assets under management includes the total amount of capital commitments or the remaining amount of invested capital at cost depending on whether the investment period has expired or as specified by the fee terms of the fund. as such, fee-earning assets under management may be greater than total assets under management when the aggregate fair value of the remaining investments is less than the cost of those investments.
perpetual capital. perpetual capital refers to the component of assets under management with an indefinite term, that is not in liquidation, and for which there is no requirement to return capital to investors through redemption requests in the ordinary course of business, except where funded by new capital inflows. perpetual capital includes co-investment capital with an investor right to convert into perpetual capital.
dry powder. dry powder represents the amount of capital available for investment or reinvestment, including general partner and employee capital, and is an indicator of the capital we have available for future investments.
performance revenue eligible assets under management. performance revenue eligible assets under management represents invested and to be invested capital at fair value, including capital closed for funds whose investment period has not yet commenced, on which performance revenues could be earned if certain hurdles are met.
income tax current developments prior to the conversion, certain of our share of investment income and carried interest was not subject to u.s. corporate income taxes. subsequent to the conversion, all income earned by us is subject to u.s. corporate income taxes, which we believe will result in an overall higher income tax expense (or benefit) over time when compared to periods prior to the conversion.
congress, the organization for economic co-operation and development ("oecd") and other government agencies in jurisdictions in which we and our affiliates invest or do business have maintained a focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational companies. the oecd, which represents a coalition of member countries, is contemplating changes to numerous long-standing tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting ("beps") project, which is focused on a number of issues, including the shifting of profits between affiliated entities in different tax jurisdictions, interest deductibility and eligibility for the benefits of double tax treaties. several of the proposed measures are potentially relevant to some of our structures and could have an adverse tax impact on our funds, investors and/or our portfolio companies. some member countries have been moving forward on the beps agenda but, because timing of implementation and the specific measures adopted will vary among participating states, significant uncertainty remains regarding the impact of beps proposals. if implemented, these proposals could result in a loss of tax treaty benefits and increased taxes on income from our investments.
a number of european jurisdictions have enacted taxes on financial transactions, and the european commission has proposed legislation to harmonize these taxes under the so-called "enhanced cooperation procedure," which provides for adoption of eu-level  legislation applicable to some but not all eu member states. these contemplated changes, if adopted by individual countries, could increase tax uncertainty and/or costs faced by us, our funds' portfolio companies and our investors, change our business model and cause other adverse consequences. the timing or impact of these proposals is unclear at this point. in addition, tax laws, regulations and interpretations are subject to continual changes, which could adversely affect our structures or returns to our investors. for instance, various countries have adopted or proposed tax legislation that may adversely affect portfolio companies and investment structures in countries in which our funds have invested and may limit the benefits of additional investments in those countries.

revenues revenues were $7.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2019, an increase of $505.0 million compared to $6.8 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to increases of $570.2 million in investment income, $444.4 million in management and advisory fees, net and $72.4 million in incentive fees, partially offset by a decrease of $592.3 million in other revenue.
the increase in investment income was primarily attributable to increases in our real estate, credit and hedge fund solutions segments of $1.0 billion, $173.4 million and $53.7 million, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in our private equity segment of $632.8 million. the increase in our real estate segment was primarily attributable to higher net appreciation of investment holdings in our brep opportunistic funds. the carrying value of investments for our brep opportunistic funds increased 17.6% for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to 9.8% for the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase in our credit segment was primarily attributable to higher returns in 2019 than in 2018 due to the negative impact of decreases in certain public positions and the volatility in the energy and credit markets in 2018. the increase in our hedge fund solutions segment was primarily driven by higher net appreciation of investments of which blackstone owns a share. the decrease in our private equity segment was primarily due to lower appreciation in corporate private equity. corporate private equity carrying value increased 9.3% for the year ended december 31, 2019 compared to 19.1% for the year ended december 31, 2018.
the increase in management and advisory fees, net was primarily due to increases in our private equity, real estate, credit and hedge fund solutions segments of $234.4 million, $138.7 million, $37.4 million and $37.3 million, respectively. the increase in our private equity segment was primarily due to increases in fee-earning assets under management in strategic partners, bip and tactical opportunities. the increase in our real estate segment was primarily due to fee-earning asset under management growth in our core+ real estate funds and breds insurance separately managed accounts, as well as higher management and transaction fees in bxmt. the increase in our credit segment was primarily due to the launch of several gso and bis funds subsequent to the year ended december 31, 2018, including successor flagship funds and multiple long only funds, as well as a full year of management fees on our bdc, partially offset by the receipt of a fixed payment in the first quarter of 2018 in connection with the conclusion of our sub-advisory relationship with fs investments. the increase in our hedge fund solutions segment was primarily due to fee-earning asset under management growth in our individual investor and specialized solutions funds and a reduction of placement fees, which offset base management fees.
the increase in incentive fees was primarily due to increases in our hedge fund solutions and credit segments of $52.8 million and $12.8 million, respectively. the increase in our hedge fund solutions segment was primarily due to higher returns across a number of strategies, including customized solutions, commingled products and individual investor solutions and specialized solutions, compared to the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase in our credit segment was primarily due to the contribution of a full year of fees from our bdc in 2019.
the decrease in other revenue was primarily due to proceeds received during the year ended december 31, 2018 from the conclusion of our sub-advisory relationship with fs investments, partially offset by a foreign exchange gain on our euro denominated bonds.
expenses expenses were $4.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2019, an increase of $452.6 million, compared to $3.5 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase was primarily attributable to increases in compensation, performance allocations compensation and general, administrative and other expenses, partially offset by a decrease of $60.7 million in fund expenses. the increase of $210.4 million in compensation was due to the increase in management and advisory fees, net, on which a portion of compensation is based. the increase of $172.4 million in performance allocations compensation was primarily due to the increase in investment income. the increase of $84.5 million in general, administrative and other expenses was primarily due to new business growth, legal and advisory fees associated with the conversion as well as consulting fees. the decrease of $60.7 million in fund expenses was due to a decrease of $61.3 million in our credit segment primarily from the deconsolidation of certain clo and other vehicles in 2018.
other income was $444.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, an increase of $252.7 million, compared to $191.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase in other income was due to increases of $161.6 million in change in tax receivable agreement liability and $91.1 million in net gains from fund investment activities.
the increase in other income - change in tax receivable agreement liability was primarily attributable to the conversion.
the increase in other income - net gain from fund investment activities was principally driven by increases of $58.7 million and $52.2 million in our real estate and credit segments, respectively, partially offset by a decrease of $20.9 million in our private equity segment. the increase in our real estate segment was primarily due to a year-over-year net increase in the appreciation of investments in our brep opportunistic funds. the increase in our credit segment was primarily driven by a year-over-year net increase in appreciation of clos and other vehicles, partially offset by the deconsolidation of certain clo and other vehicles during the twelve months ended december 31, 2018. the decrease in our private equity segment was primarily due to lower appreciation of investments across the private equity funds.

(a)   includes income that was not taxable to blackstone and its subsidiaries. such income was directly taxable to shareholders of blackstone's class a common stock for the period prior to the conversion and remains taxable to blackstone's non-controlling interest holders.
(b)   the change in valuation allowance for the year ended december 31, 2019 represents the change from july 1, 2019 to december 31, 2019, following the change to a taxable corporation.
blackstone's provision (benefit) for taxes for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $(48.0) million, $249.4 million and $743.1 million, respectively. this resulted in an effective tax rate of -1.3%, 7.1% and 18.0%, respectively, based on our income before provision (benefit) for taxes of $3.8 billion, $3.5 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively.
the decrease in blackstone's effective tax rate for the year ended december 31, 2019, compared with the year ended december 31, 2018 resulted primarily from the tax benefit recorded on the date of the conversion, which was partially offset by a higher level of income being subject to u.s. federal (and state and local) corporate income taxes following the conversion.
additional information regarding our income taxes can be found in "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - note 15. income taxes" of this filing.
non-controlling interests in consolidated entities the net income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests in consolidated entities and net income attributable to non-controlling interests in consolidated entities is attributable to the consolidated blackstone funds. the amounts of these items vary directly with the performance of the consolidated blackstone funds and largely eliminate the amount of other income - net gains from fund investment activities from the net income (loss) attributable to the blackstone group inc.
net income attributable to non-controlling interests in blackstone holdings is derived from the income before provision (benefit) for taxes, excluding the net gains from fund investment activities and the percentage allocation of the income between blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of blackstone holdings and blackstone after considering any contractual arrangements that govern the allocation of income such as fees allocable to blackstone.
for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the net income before taxes allocated to blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of blackstone holdings was 43.9%, 44.0% and 44.9%, respectively. the decrease of 0.1% was primarily due to conversions of blackstone holdings partnership units to shares of class a common stock and the vesting of shares of class a common stock.
the other income - reduction of tax receivable agreement liability was entirely allocated to the blackstone group inc.

*   represents funds that are currently in their investment period and open-ended funds.
(a)   excludes investment vehicles where blackstone does not earn fees.
(b)   available capital represents total investable capital commitments, including side-by-side, adjusted for certain expenses and expired or recallable capital and may include leverage, less invested capital. this amount is not reduced by outstanding commitments to investments.
(c)   multiple of invested capital ("moic") represents carrying value, before management fees, expenses and performance revenues, divided by invested capital.
(d)   net internal rate of return ("irr") represents the annualized inception to december 31, 2019 irr on total invested capital based on realized proceeds and unrealized value, as applicable, after management fees, expenses and performance revenues. irrs are calculated using actual timing of limited partner cash flows. initial inception date cash flow may differ from the investment period beginning date.
(e)   the 8% realized net irr and 8% total net irr exclude investors that opted out of the hilton investment opportunity. overall brep international ii performance reflects a 7% realized net irr and a 7% total net irr.
(f)   brep co-investment represents co-investment capital raised for various brep investments. the net irr reflected is calculated by aggregating each co-investment's realized proceeds and unrealized value, as applicable, after management fees, expenses and performance revenues.
(g)   bpp represents the core+ real estate funds which invest with a more modest risk profile and lower leverage.
(h)   unrealized investment value reflects breit's net asset value as of december 31, 2019. realized investment value represents breit's cash distributions, net of servicing fees. breit net return reflects a per share blended return, assuming breit had a single share class, reinvestment of all dividends received during the period, and no upfront selling commission, net of all fees and expenses incurred by breit. these returns are not representative of the returns experienced by any particular investor or share class. inception to date net returns are presented on an annualized basis and are from january 1, 2017.
(j)   bcep, or blackstone core equity partners, is a core private equity fund which invests with a more modest risk profile and longer hold period.
(k)   realizations are treated as return of capital until fully recovered and therefore unrealized and realized moics are not meaningful. if information is not available on a timely basis, returns are calculated from results that are reported on a three month lag.
(l)   funds presented represent the flagship credit drawdown funds only. the total credit net irr is the combined irr of the credit drawdown funds presented.

segment distributable earnings were $1.5 billion for the year ended december 31, 2019, an increase of $133.3 million, or 10%, compared to $1.4 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase in segment distributable earnings was primarily attributable to increases of $118.5 million in fee related earnings and $14.8 million in net realizations.
segment distributable earnings in our real estate segment in 2019 were higher compared to 2018. this was primarily driven by growth in fee-earning assets under management in our core+ real estate funds, an increase in management fees from our breds liquids funds, and higher realized performance revenues in brep and breit in 2019 compared to 2018. the market environment continues to be characterized by volatility and macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns, such as uncertainty regarding the next stage of trade negotiations between the u.s. and china and concerns regarding the rate of global growth and the impact of the recent and rapidly evolving outbreak of the novel coronavirus in many countries. we have also seen an increasing focus in certain markets in the u.s. and europe toward rent regulation as a means to address residential affordability caused by undersupply of housing. such conditions (which may be across industries, sectors or geographies) may contribute to adverse operating performance, including by moderating rent growth in certain markets in our residential portfolio. such conditions may also limit attractive realization opportunities for our real estate segment. overall, operating trends in our real estate portfolio remain stable and supply-demand fundamentals remain positive in most markets, although decelerating growth in certain sectors, including retail, may contribute to a more challenging operating environment. factors such as increasing wages and a tight labor market create profit margin pressure in certain sectors in the u.s., including hospitality. capital deployment in opportunistic investments in the u.s. continues to be challenging, as distress levels are low and asset values are relatively high. nonetheless, we deployed a record $22.5 billion of capital in our real estate segment in 2019, primarily in north america. see "part i. item 1a. risk factors - risks related to our business - difficult market and geopolitical conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways, each of which could materially reduce our revenue, earnings and cash flow and adversely affect our financial prospects and condition" and "- a period of economic slowdown, which may be across one or more industries, sectors or geographies, could contribute to adverse operating performance for certain of our funds' investments, which would adversely affect our operating results and cash flows."
fee related earnings fee related earnings were $763.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, an increase of $118.5 million, or 18%, compared to $645.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase in fee related earnings was primarily attributable to increases of $138.7 million in management fees, net and $73.7 million in fee related performance revenues, partially offset by increases of $71.8 million in fee related compensation and $22.1 million in other operating expenses.
management fees, net were $1.3 billion for the year ended december 31, 2019, an increase of $138.7 million compared to $1.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2018, primarily driven by an increase in base management fees. base management fees were $1.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2019, an increase of $130.8 million compared to $985.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, primarily due to fee-earning assets under management growth in our core+ real estate funds and breds insurance separately managed accounts, as well as higher management and transaction fees in bxmt.
fee related performance revenues were $198.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, an increase of $73.7 million, compared to $124.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase was primarily due to timing of crystallizations in bpp u.s. and an increase in breit net asset value.
fee related compensation was $531.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, an increase of $71.8 million, compared to $459.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase was primarily due to increases in management and advisory fees, net and fee related performance fee revenues on which a portion of fee related compensation is based.
other operating expenses were $168.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, an increase of $22.1 million, compared to $146.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase was primarily due to consulting fees and other business development costs.
net realizations net realizations were $738.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, an increase of $14.8 million, compared to $723.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase in net realizations was primarily attributable to an increase of $117.4 million in realized performance revenues, partially offset by an increase of $89.8 million in realized performance compensation and a decrease of $12.8 million in realized principal investment income.
realized performance revenues were $1.0 billion for the year ended december 31, 2019, an increase of $117.4 million, compared to $915.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase was due to higher realized performance revenues in brep and breds.
realized performance compensation was $374.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, an increase of $89.8 million, compared to $284.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase was due to the increase in realized performance revenues.
realized principal investment income was $79.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, a decrease of $12.8 million, compared to $92.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the decrease was primarily due to lower realized principal investment income for brep vi.

(j)   effective september 30, 2019, the breit return reflects a per share blended return for each respective period, assuming breit had a single share class, reinvestment of all dividends received during the period, and no upfront selling commission, net of all fees and expenses incurred by breit. these returns are not representative of the returns experienced by any particular investor or share class. inception to date returns are presented on an annualized basis and are from january 1, 2017. prior periods have been updated to reflect breit's per share blended return. the breit returns presented in filings prior to september 30, 2019 were for breit's class s investors.
as of december 31, 2019, brep ix was not above its carried interest threshold at the fund level. however, certain brep ix investors have a reduced management fee due to completing their capital commitment process as of the initial closing date, thereby resulting in higher net gains and have exceeded the carried interest threshold this quarter.
the real estate segment has two funds in their investment period, which were above their respective carried interest thresholds as of december 31, 2019: brep asia ii and breds iii.

segment distributable earnings were $847.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, a decrease of $23.1 million, compared to $870.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the decrease in segment distributable earnings was primarily attributable to a decrease of $182.3 million in net realizations, partially offset by an increase of $159.2 million in fee related earnings.
segment distributable earnings in our private equity segment in 2019 were lower compared to 2018, primarily driven by a decrease in realized performance revenue in corporate private equity and strategic partners, partially offset by an increase in fee related earnings from growth in fee-earning assets under management in strategic partners, bip and tactical opportunities. stable underlying performance private investment in the corporate private equity portfolio was partially offset by declines in two public holdings. an increased focus on energy sustainability, including potential alternatives to fossil fuels, has exacerbated the impact of weakened market fundamentals in certain energy subsectors, particularly upstream. the persistence of these weakened market fundamentals would negatively impact the performance of certain investments in our energy and corporate private equity funds. the market environment has continued to be characterized by volatility and macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns, such as uncertainty regarding the next stage of trade negotiations between the u.s. and china and concerns regarding the rate of global growth and the impact of the recent and rapidly evolving outbreak of the novel coronavirus in many countries. such conditions (which may be across industries, sectors or geographies) may contribute to adverse operating performance at our portfolio companies and limit attractive realization opportunities for our private equity segment. factors such as increasing wages, a tight labor market, the imposition of tariffs and overall uncertainty regarding trade policy, create challenges to increasing or maintaining profit margins for u.s. companies, particularly in the industrials and retail sectors. in that connection, adverse wage and trade developments put pressure on our ability to increase profit margins at our u.s. portfolio companies through operational initiatives. the market environment continues to be generally characterized by high prices, and this can make deployment of capital more difficult. nonetheless, we deployed $26.6 billion of capital across the segment in 2019. see "part i. item 1a. risk factors - risks related to our business - difficult market and geopolitical conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways, each of which could materially reduce our revenue, earnings and cash flow and adversely affect our financial prospects and condition" and "- a period of economic slowdown, which may be across one or more industries, sectors or geographies, could contribute to adverse operating performance for certain of our funds' investments, which would adversely affect our operating results and cash flows."
fee related earnings fee related earnings were $480.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, an increase of $159.2 million, or 50%, compared to $321.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase in fee related earnings was primarily attributable to an increase of $234.4 million in management and advisory fees, net, partially offset by increases of $48.3 million in fee related compensation and $26.9 million in other operating expenses.
management and advisory fees, net were $1.1 billion for the year ended december 31, 2019, an increase of $234.4 million compared to $829.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, primarily driven by an increase in base management fees. base management fees were $986.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, an increase of $201.3 million compared to $785.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, primarily due to increases in fee-earning assets under management in strategic partners, bip and tactical opportunities.
fee related compensation was $423.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, an increase of $48.3 million, compared to $375.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase was primarily due to the increase in management and advisory fees, net, on which a portion of fee related compensation is based.
other operating expenses were $160.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, an increase of $26.9 million, compared to $133.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase was primarily due to consulting fees and growth in our new business initiatives, including bxls.
net realizations net realizations were $366.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, a decrease of $182.3 million, compared to $549.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the decrease in net realizations was primarily attributable to decreases of $288.4 million in realized performance revenues and $19.5 million in realized principal investment income, partially offset by a decrease of $125.6 million in realized performance compensation.
realized performance revenues were $469.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, a decrease of $288.4 million, compared to $757.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the decrease was primarily due to lower realized performance revenues in corporate private equity and strategic partners.
realized principal investment income was $90.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, a decrease of $19.5 million, compared to $109.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the decrease was primarily due to a decrease of realized principal investment income in corporate private equity.
realized performance compensation was $192.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, a decrease of $125.6 million, compared to $318.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the decrease was due to the decrease in realized performance revenues.

(a)   net returns are based on the change in carrying value (realized and unrealized) after management fees, expenses and performance revenues.
(b)   realizations are treated as return of capital until fully recovered and therefore inception to date realized returns are not applicable. returns are calculated from results that are reported on a three month lag.
the corporate private equity funds within the private equity segment have five funds with closed investment periods: bcp iv, bcp v, bcp vi, bcom and bep i. as of december 31, 2019, bcp iv was above its carried interest threshold (i.e., the preferred return payable to its limited partners before the general partner is eligible to receive carried interest) and would still be above its carried interest threshold even if all remaining investments were valued at zero. bcp v is comprised of two fund classes based on the timings of fund closings, the bcp v "main fund" and bcp v-ac fund. within these fund classes, the general partner is subject to equalization such that (a) the general partner accrues carried interest when the respective carried interest for either fund class is positive and (b) the general partner realizes carried interest so long as clawback obligations, if any, for either of the respective fund classes are fully satisfied. during the quarter, bcp v is currently below its carried interest threshold, while bcp v-ac is above its carried interest threshold. bcp vi is currently above its carried interest threshold. bcom is currently above its carried interest threshold. we are entitled to retain previously realized carried interest up to 20% of bcom's net gains. as a result, performance revenues are recognized from bcom on current period gains and losses. bep i is currently above its carried interest threshold.

segment distributable earnings were $450.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, an increase of $129.6 million, or 40%, compared to $320.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase in segment distributable earnings was primarily attributable to increases of $86.3 million in net realizations and $43.2 million in fee related earnings.
segment distributable earnings in our hedge fund solutions segment in 2019 were higher compared to 2018. this increase was primarily driven by an increase in realized performance revenues due to higher returns across a number of strategies in 2019 compared to 2018, and growth in fee-earning assets under management in individual investor and specialized solutions and a reduction in placement fees, which offset base management fees. segment distributable earnings in the hedge fund solutions segment would likely be negatively impacted in the event of a significant or sustained decline in global, regional or sector asset prices, or a prolonged weak equity market environment, which may be caused by concerns over macroeconomic and geopolitical factors such as uncertainty regarding the next stage of trade negotiations between the u.s. and china and concerns regarding the rate of global growth and the impact of the recent and rapidly evolving outbreak of the novel coronavirus in many countries. see "part i. item 1a. risk factors - risks related to our business - difficult market and geopolitical conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways, each of which could materially reduce our revenue, earnings and cash flow and adversely affect our financial prospects and condition," "- a period of economic slowdown, which may be across one or more industries, sectors or geographies, could contribute to adverse operating performance for certain of our funds' investments, which would adversely affect our operating results and cash flows" and "- hedge fund investments are subject to numerous additional risks." in an equity market environment that has in recent years been characterized by relatively low volatility, investors may choose to reallocate capital away from traditional hedge fund strategies. our hedge fund solutions segment operates multiple business lines, manages strategies that are both long and short asset classes and generates a majority of its revenue through management fees. in that regard, the segment's revenues will depend in part on our ability to successfully grow such existing diverse business lines and strategies, and identify new ones to meet evolving investor appetites. over time we anticipate an increasing change in the mix of our product offerings to products whose performance-based fees represent a more significant proportion of the fees than has historically been the case for such products.
fee related earnings fee related earnings were $326.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, an increase of $43.2 million, or 15%, compared to $282.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase in fee related earnings was primarily attributable to an increase of $37.3 million in management fees, net and a decrease of $10.2 million in fee related compensation.
management fees, net were $560.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, an increase of $37.3 million, compared to $522.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, primarily driven by an increase in base management fees. base management fees were $556.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, an increase of $36.9 million, compared to $519.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, primarily due to fee-earning asset under management growth in our individual investor and specialized solutions and a reduction in placement fees, which offset base management fees.
fee related compensation was $152.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, a decrease of $10.2 million, compared to $162.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the decrease was primarily due to changes in compensation accruals.
net realizations net realizations were $124.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, an increase of $86.3 million, or 229%, compared to $37.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase in net realizations was primarily attributable to an increase of $84.2 million in realized performance revenues.
realized performance revenues were $126.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, an increase of $84.2 million, compared to $42.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase was primarily driven by higher returns across a number of strategies, including customized solutions, commingled products and individual investor and specialized solutions, compared to the year ended december 31, 2018.
operating metrics the following table presents information regarding our invested performance revenue eligible assets under management:

(a)   estimated % above high water mark/benchmark represents the percentage of invested performance revenue eligible assets under management that as of the dates presented would earn performance fees when the applicable hedge fund solutions managed fund has positive investment performance relative to a benchmark, where applicable. incremental positive performance in the applicable blackstone funds may cause additional assets to reach their respective high water mark or clear a benchmark return, thereby resulting in an increase in estimated % above high water mark/benchmark.
(b)   for the hedge fund solutions managed funds, at december 31, 2019, the incremental appreciation needed for the 9% of invested performance revenue eligible assets under management below their respective high water marks/benchmarks to reach their respective high water marks/benchmarks was $504.3 million, a decrease of $352.4 million, compared to $856.7 million at december 31, 2018. of the invested performance revenue eligible assets under management below their respective high water marks/benchmarks as of december 31, 2019, 33% were within 5% of reaching their respective high water mark.

segment distributable earnings were $270.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, an increase of $4.1 million, compared to $266.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase in segment distributable earnings was primarily attributable to an increase of $11.7 million in fee related earnings, partially offset by a decrease of $7.6 million in net realizations.
segment distributable earnings in our credit segment in 2019 were higher compared to 2018, driven in part by higher fee related earnings as a result of the launch of several gso and bis funds in 2019, as well as a full year of management fees from the bdc. this was partially offset by lower realized performance revenue due to a mezzanine fund crossing its carry threshold at the end of 2017, which resulted in higher realized performance in 2018 compared to 2019. in a distressed market that continues to be challenged, our performing credit strategies delivered a 13% gross return in 2019 and our distressed strategies declined 4.0%, largely driven by decreases in certain upstream energy positions. an increased focus on energy sustainability, including potential alternatives to fossil fuels, has exacerbated the impact of weakened market fundamentals in certain energy subsectors, particularly upstream. the persistence of weakened market fundamentals in the energy sector or in the credit markets more broadly, including as a result of concerns regarding the impact of the recent and rapidly evolving outbreak of the novel coronavirus in many countries, would negatively impact the performance of certain credit segment investments. our credit segment deployed $10.2 billion of capital in 2019. see "part i. item 1a. risk factors - risks related to our business - difficult market and geopolitical conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways, each of which could materially reduce our revenue, earnings and cash flow and adversely affect our financial prospects and condition" and "- a period of economic slowdown, which may be across one or more industries, sectors or geographies, could contribute to adverse operating performance for certain of our funds' investments, which would adversely affect our operating results and cash flows."
fee related earnings fee related earnings were $218.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, an increase of $11.7 million, compared to $206.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase in fee related earnings was primarily attributable to increases of $37.4 million in management fees, net and $14.4 million in fee related performance revenues, partially offset increases of $29.6 million in other operating expenses and $10.5 million in fee related compensation.
management fees, net were $594.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, an increase of $37.4 million, compared to $557.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2018, primarily driven by an increase in base management fees. base management fees were $586.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, an increase of $32.6 million, compared to $553.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase was primarily due to the launch of several gso and bis funds subsequent to the year ended december 31, 2018, including successor flagship funds and multiple long only funds, as well as a full year of management fees on our bdc, partially offset by the receipt of a fixed payment in the first quarter of 2018 in connection with the conclusion of our sub-advisory relationship with fs investments.
fee related performance revenues were $13.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, an increase of $14.4 million, compared to $(0.7) million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase was due to the ramp up of our bdc.
other operating expenses were $160.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, an increase of $29.6 million, compared to $131.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase was primarily due to the growth in our new business initiatives, including bis and the direct lending platform.
fee related compensation was $229.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, an increase of $10.5 million, compared to $219.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase was primarily due to the increase in management fees, net, on which a portion of fee related compensation is based.
net realizations net realizations were $52.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, a decrease of $7.6 million, compared to $59.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the decrease in net realizations was primarily attributable to a decrease of $64.2 million in realized performance revenues, partially offset by a decrease of $40.9 million in realized performance compensation and an increase of $15.7 million in realized principal investment income.
realized performance revenues were $32.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, a decrease of $64.2 million, compared to $97.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the decrease was primarily attributable to a mezzanine fund crossing its carry threshold during the fourth quarter of 2017, resulting in higher realized performance revenues in the year ended december 31, 2018 compared to the year ended december 31, 2019.
realized performance compensation was $13.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, a decrease of $40.9 million, compared to $53.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the decrease was due to the decrease in realized performance revenues.
realized principal investment income was $32.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2019, an increase of $15.7 million, compared to $16.8 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. the increase was driven by the realized gain on our corporate treasury investments.

as of december 31, 2019, there was $18.7 billion of performance revenue eligible assets under management invested in credit strategies that were above the hurdle necessary to generate incentive fees or performance allocations. this represented 38% of the total performance revenue eligible assets under management across all credit strategies.
non-gaap financial measures these non-gaap financial measures are presented without the consolidation of any blackstone funds that are consolidated into the consolidated financial statements. consequently, all non-gaap financial measures exclude the assets, liabilities and operating results related to the blackstone funds. see "- key financial measures and indicators" for our definitions of distributable earnings, segment distributable earnings, fee related earnings and adjusted ebitda.
the following table is a reconciliation of net income attributable to the blackstone group inc. to distributable earnings, total segment distributable earnings, fee related earnings and adjusted ebitda:

liquidity and capital resources general blackstone's business model derives revenue primarily from third party assets under management. blackstone is not a capital or balance sheet intensive business and targets operating expense levels such that total management and advisory fees exceed total operating expenses each period. as a result, we require limited capital resources to support the working capital or operating needs of our businesses. we draw primarily on the long-term committed capital of our limited partner investors to fund the investment requirements of the blackstone funds and use our own realizations and cash flows to invest in growth initiatives, make commitments to our own funds, where our minimum general partner commitments are generally less than 5% of the limited partner commitments of a fund, and pay dividends to shareholders.
fluctuations in our statement of financial condition result primarily from activities of the blackstone funds that are consolidated as well as business transactions, such as the issuance of senior notes described below. the majority economic ownership interests of the blackstone funds are reflected as redeemable non-controlling interests in consolidated entities, and non-controlling interests in consolidated entities in the consolidated financial statements. the consolidation of these blackstone funds has no net effect on blackstone's net income or partners' capital. additionally, fluctuations in our statement of financial condition also include appreciation or depreciation in blackstone investments in the blackstone funds, additional investments and redemptions of such interests in the blackstone funds and the collection of receivables related to management and advisory fees.
total assets were $32.6 billion as of december 31, 2019, an increase of $3.7 billion, or 13%, from december 31, 2018. the increase in total assets was principally due to an increase of $3.6 billion in total assets attributable to the consolidated operating partnerships. the increase in total assets attributable to the consolidated operating partnerships was primarily due to increases of $1.9 billion in investments, $595.2 million in due from affiliates and $471.1 million in right-of-use assets. the increase in investments was primarily due to appreciation in the value of blackstone's interests in its real estate and private equity investments. the increase in due from affiliates was primarily due to management fees, performance revenues and reimbursable expenses from non-consolidated entities and portfolio companies. effective january 1, 2019, blackstone adopted new gaap guidance on the accounting for leases on a modified retrospective basis. see note 2. "summary of significant accounting policies" in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" in "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this filing. the adoption resulted in the recognition of right-of-use assets of $471.1 million as of december 31, 2019. the other net variances of the assets attributable to the consolidated operating partnerships were relatively unchanged.
total liabilities were $17.5 billion as of december 31, 2019, an increase of $2.3 billion, or 15%, from december 31, 2018. the increase in total liabilities was principally due to an increase of $2.4 billion in total liabilities attributable to the consolidated operating partnerships. the increase in total liabilities attributable to the consolidated operating partnerships was primarily due to increases of $1.1 billion in loans payable, $853.9 million in accrued compensation and benefits and $543.0 million in operating lease liability. the increase in loans payable was due to the issuance of €600 million of notes on april 10, 2019 and $500 million and $400 million of notes on september 10, 2019. the increase in accrued compensation and benefits was primarily due to an increase in performance compensation. effective january 1, 2019, blackstone adopted new gaap guidance on the accounting for leases on a modified retrospective basis. the adoption resulted in the recognition of operating lease liabilities of $543.0 million as of december 31, 2019. the other net variances of the liabilities attributable to the consolidated operating partnerships were relatively unchanged.
sources and uses of liquidity we have multiple sources of liquidity to meet our capital needs, including annual cash flows, accumulated earnings in our businesses, the proceeds from our issuances of senior notes, liquid investments we hold on our balance sheet and access to our $1.6 billion committed revolving credit facility. as of december 31, 2019, blackstone had $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $2.4 billion invested in corporate treasury investments, against $4.7 billion in borrowings from our bond issuances, and no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility.
on september 3, 2019, blackstone commenced the tender offer for any and all of its 2021 notes. on september 9, 2019, the tender offer expired and $175.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2021 notes were validly tendered for payment. payment for the tendered notes was made on september 10, 2019. on october 10, 2019, in accordance with the optional redemption provision under the indenture governing the 2021 notes, blackstone redeemed the 2021 notes that were not previously tendered in the tender offer.
on september 10, 2019, blackstone issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.500% senior notes maturing on january 10, 2030 and $400 million aggregate principal amount of 3.500% senior notes maturing on september 10, 2049. blackstone used the proceeds from the notes offering, together with cash on hand or available liquidity, to effectuate the tender offer and subsequent redemption of the 2021 notes and to pay related fees and expenses. remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes.
in addition to the cash we received from our notes offerings and availability under our revolving credit facility, we expect to receive (a) cash generated from operating activities, (b) performance allocations and incentive fee realizations, and (c) realizations on the fund investments that we make. the amounts received from these three sources in particular may vary substantially from year to year and quarter to quarter depending on the frequency and size of realization events or net returns experienced by our investment funds. our available capital could be adversely affected if there are prolonged periods of few substantial realizations from our investment funds accompanied by substantial capital calls for new investments from those investment funds. therefore, blackstone's commitments to our funds are taken into consideration when managing our overall liquidity and cash position.
we expect that our primary liquidity needs will be cash to (a) provide capital to facilitate the growth of our existing businesses, which principally includes funding our general partner and co-investment commitments to our funds, (b) provide capital to facilitate our expansion into new businesses, (c) pay operating expenses, including cash compensation to our employees, and other obligations as they arise, (d) fund modest capital expenditures, (e) repay borrowings and related interest costs, (f) pay income taxes, (g) repurchase share of our common stock and blackstone holdings partnership units pursuant to our repurchase program and (h) pay dividends to our shareholders and distributions to the holders of blackstone holdings partnership units.

(a)   for some of the general partner commitments shown in the table above we require our senior managing directors and certain other professionals to fund a portion of the commitment even though the ultimate obligation to fund the aggregate commitment is ours pursuant to the governing agreements of the respective funds. the amounts of the aggregate applicable general partner original and remaining commitment are shown in the table above. in addition, certain senior managing directors and other professionals may be required to fund a de minimis amount of the commitment in certain carry funds. we expect our commitments to be drawn down over time and to be funded by available cash and cash generated from operations and realizations. taking into account prevailing market conditions and both the liquidity and cash or liquid investment balances, we believe that the sources of liquidity described above will be more than sufficient to fund our working capital requirements.
(b)   represents capital commitments to a number of other funds in each respective segment.
(c)   represents loan origination commitments, which are typically funded within 60-90 days of making a commitment, and capital market commitments.
(a)   the notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the issuer and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by the blackstone group inc. and each of the blackstone holdings partnerships. the notes contain customary covenants and financial restrictions that, among other things, limit the issuer and the guarantors' ability, subject to certain exceptions, to incur indebtedness secured by liens on voting stock or profit participating equity interests of their subsidiaries or merge, consolidate or sell, transfer or lease assets. the notes also contain customary events of default. all or a portion of the notes may be redeemed at our option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, prior to their stated maturity, at the make-whole redemption price set forth in the notes. if a change of control repurchase event occurs, the notes are subject to repurchase at the repurchase price as set forth in the notes.
blackstone, through its indirect subsidiary blackstone holdings finance co. l.l.c., has a $1.6 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the "credit facility") with citibank, n.a., as administrative agent with a maturity date of september 21, 2023. borrowings may also be made in u.k. sterling, euros, swiss francs, japanese yen or canadian dollars, in each case subject to certain sub-limits.  the credit facility contains customary representations, covenants and events of default. financial covenants consist of a maximum net leverage ratio and a requirement to keep a minimum amount of fee-earning assets under management, each tested quarterly.
on july 16, 2019, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of class a common stock and blackstone holdings partnership units. under the repurchase program, repurchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. the timing and the actual number repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including legal requirements, price and economic and market conditions. the repurchase program may be changed, suspended or discontinued at any time and does not have a specified expiration date.
during the year ended december 31, 2019, we repurchased 12.8 million shares of class a common stock as part of the repurchase program at a total cost of $561.9 million. as of december 31, 2019, the amount remaining available for repurchases under the program was $781.2 million.
dividends our intention is to pay to holders of class a common stock a quarterly dividend representing approximately 85% of the blackstone group inc.'s share of distributable earnings, subject to adjustment by amounts determined by our board of directors to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the conduct of our business, to make appropriate investments in our business and funds, to comply with applicable law, any of our debt instruments or other agreements, or to provide for future cash requirements such as tax-related payments, clawback obligations and dividends to shareholders for any ensuing quarter. the dividend amount could also be adjusted upward in any one quarter.
for blackstone's definition of distributable earnings, see "- key financial measures and indicators".
all of the foregoing is subject to the qualification that the declaration and payment of any dividends are at the sole discretion of our board of directors, and our board of directors may change our dividend policy at any time, including, without limitation, to reduce such quarterly dividends or even to eliminate such dividends entirely.
because the publicly traded entity and/or its wholly owned subsidiaries must pay taxes and make payments under the tax receivable agreements, the amounts ultimately paid as dividends by the blackstone group inc. to common shareholders in respect of each fiscal year are generally expected to be less, on a per share or per unit basis, than the amounts distributed by the blackstone holdings partnerships to the blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of the blackstone holdings partnerships in respect of their blackstone holdings partnership units. following the conversion, we expect to pay more corporate income taxes than we would have as a limited partnership, which will increase this difference in the dividend and/or distribution amounts on a per share or per unit basis.
dividends are treated as qualified dividends to the extent of blackstone's current and accumulated earnings and profits, with any excess dividends treated as a return of capital to the extent of the shareholder's basis.
the following graph shows fiscal quarterly and annual per common shareholder dividends for 2017, 2018 and 2019. dividends are declared and paid in the quarter subsequent to the quarter in which they are earned.
with respect to fiscal year 2019, we paid to shareholders of our class a common stock a dividend of $0.37, $0.48, $0.49 and $0.61 per share in respect of the first, second, third and fourth quarters, respectively, aggregating $1.95 per share. with respect to fiscal years 2018 and 2017, we paid to shareholders of our class a common stock an aggregate dividend of $2.15 per share and $2.70 per share, respectively. the dividend for each of the second, third and fourth quarter of 2018 was $0.58, $0.64 and $0.58, respectively, and in each case included a $0.10 per share dividend from a portion of the after-tax proceeds received in connection with the conclusion of blackstone's sub-advisory relationship with fs investments.
leverage we may under certain circumstances use leverage opportunistically and over time to create the most efficient capital structure for blackstone and our shareholders. in addition to the borrowings from our notes issuances and our revolving credit facility, we may use reverse repurchase agreements, repurchase agreements and securities sold, not yet purchased. all of these positions are held in a separately managed portfolio. reverse repurchase agreements are entered into primarily to take advantage of opportunistic yields otherwise absent in the overnight markets and also to use the collateral received to cover securities sold, not yet purchased. repurchase agreements are entered into primarily to opportunistically yield higher spreads on purchased securities. the balances held in these financial instruments fluctuate based on blackstone's liquidity needs, market conditions and investment risk profiles.
generally the funds in our private equity segment, our opportunistic real estate funds, funds of hedge funds and certain credit-focused funds have not utilized substantial leverage at the fund level other than for (a) short-term borrowings between the date of an investment and the receipt of capital from the investing fund's investors, and (b) long-term borrowings for certain investments in aggregate amounts which are generally 1% to 25% of the capital commitments of the respective fund. our carry funds make direct or indirect investments in companies that utilize leverage in their capital structure. the degree of leverage employed varies among portfolio companies.
certain of our real estate debt hedge funds, hedge fund solutions funds and credit-focused funds use leverage in order to obtain additional market exposure, enhance returns on invested capital and/or to bridge short-term cash needs. the forms of leverage primarily employed by these funds include purchasing securities on margin, utilizing collateralized financing and using derivative instruments.
the following table presents information regarding these financial instruments in our consolidated statements of financial condition:
repurchase                 securities agreements              sold, not yet purchased critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap. in applying many of these accounting principles, we need to make assumptions, estimates and/or judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in our consolidated financial statements. we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. these assumptions, estimates and/or judgments, however, are often subjective. actual results may be affected negatively based on changing circumstances. if actual amounts are ultimately different from our estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. we believe the following critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying assumptions, estimates and/or judgments. for a description of our accounting policies, see note 2. "summary of significant accounting policies" in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" in "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this filing.
principles of consolidation for a description of our accounting policy on consolidation, see note 2. "summary of significant accounting policies - consolidation" and note 9. "variable interest entities" in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" in "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" for detailed information on blackstone's involvement with vies. the following discussion is intended to provide supplemental information about how the application of consolidation principles impact our financial results, and management's process for implementing those principles including areas of significant judgment.
the determination that blackstone holds a controlling financial interest in a blackstone fund or investment vehicle significantly changes the presentation of our consolidated financial statements. in our consolidated statements of financial position included in this filing, we present 100% of the assets and liabilities of consolidated vies along with a non-controlling interest which represents the portion of the consolidated vehicle's interests held by third parties. however, assets of our consolidated vies can only be used to settle obligations of the consolidated vie and are not available for general use by blackstone. further, the liabilities of our consolidated vies do not have recourse to the general credit of blackstone. in the consolidated statements of operations, we eliminate any management fees, incentive fees, or performance allocations received or accrued from consolidated vies as they are considered intercompany transactions. we recognize 100% of the consolidated vie's investment income (loss) and allocate the portion of that income (loss) attributable to third party ownership to non-controlling interests in arriving at net income attributable to the blackstone group inc.
the assessment of whether we consolidate a blackstone fund or investment vehicle we manage requires the application of significant judgment. these judgments are applied both at the time we become involved with the vie and on an ongoing basis and include, but are not limited to:
•   determining whether our management fees, incentive fees or performance allocations represent variable interests - we make judgments as to whether the fees we earn are commensurate with the level of effort required for those fees and at market rates. in making this judgment, we consider, among other things, the extent of third party investment in the entity and the terms of any other interests we hold in the vie.
•   determining whether kick-out rights are substantive - we make judgments as to whether the third party investors in a partnership entity have the ability to remove the general partner, the investment manager or its equivalent, or to dissolve (liquidate) the partnership entity, through a simple majority vote. this includes an evaluation of whether barriers to exercise these rights exist.
•   concluding whether blackstone has an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie - as there is no explicit threshold in gaap to define "potentially significant," management must apply judgment and evaluate both quantitative and qualitative factors to conclude whether this threshold is met.
revenue recognition for a description of our accounting policy on revenue recognition, see note 2. "summary of significant accounting policies - revenue recognition" in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" in "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data." for additional description of the nature of our revenue arrangements, including how management fees, incentive fees, and performance allocations are generated, please refer to "part i. item 1. business - fee structure/incentive arrangements." the following discussion is intended to provide supplemental information about how the application of revenue recognition principles impact our financial results, and management's process for implementing those principles including areas of significant judgment.
management and advisory fees, net - blackstone earns base management fees from the investors in each of its managed funds and investment vehicles, at a fixed percentage of a calculation base which is typically assets under management, net asset value, total assets, committed capital or invested capital. the range of management fee rates and the calculation base from which they are earned, generally, are as follows:
on private equity, real estate, and certain of our hedge fund solutions and credit-focused funds:
•   0.25% to 1.75% of committed capital or invested capital during the investment period,
•   0.25% to 1.50% of invested capital, committed capital and investment fair value subsequent to the investment period for private equity and real estate funds, and
•   0.75% to 1.50% of invested capital or net asset value subsequent to the investment period for certain of our hedge fund solutions and credit-focused funds.
on real estate, credit and mlp-focused funds structured like hedge funds:
•   0.30% to 1.50% of net asset value.
on credit and mlp-focused separately managed accounts:
•   0.25% to 1.50% of net asset value or total assets.
•   0.50% to 2.00% of invested capital, net operating income or net asset value.
•   0.25% to 1.50% of net asset value.
•   0.40% to 0.65% of the aggregate par amount of collateral assets, including principal cash.
on credit-focused registered and non-registered investment companies:
•   0.35% to 1.50% of total assets or net asset value.
the investment adviser of bxmt receives annual management fees based on 1.50% of bxmt's net proceeds received from equity offerings and accumulated "core earnings" (which is generally equal to its gaap net income excluding certain non-cash and other items), subject to certain adjustments. the investment adviser of breit receives a management fee of 1.25% per annum of net asset value, payable monthly.
management fee calculations based on committed capital or invested capital are mechanical in nature and therefore do not require the use of significant estimates or judgments. management fee calculations based on net asset value, total assets, or investment fair value depend on the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds. estimates and assumptions are made when determining the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds and could vary depending on the valuation methodology that is used as well as economic conditions. see "- fair value" below for further discussion of the judgment required for determining the fair value of the underlying investments.
investment income (loss) - performance allocations are made to the general partner based on cumulative fund performance to date, subject to a preferred return to limited partners. blackstone has concluded that investments made alongside its limited partners in a partnership which entitle blackstone to a performance allocation represent equity method investments that are not in the scope of the gaap guidance on accounting for revenues from contracts with customers. blackstone accounts for these arrangements under the equity method of accounting. under the equity method blackstone's share of earnings (losses) from equity method investments is determined using a balance sheet approach referred to as the hypothetical liquidation at book value ("hlbv") method. under the hlbv method, at the end of each reporting period blackstone calculates the accrued performance allocations that would be due to blackstone for each fund pursuant to the fund agreements as if the fair value of the underlying investments were realized as of such date, irrespective of whether such amounts have been realized. performance allocations are subject to clawback to the extent that the performance allocation received to date exceeds the amount due to blackstone based on cumulative results.
the change in the fair value of the investments held by certain blackstone funds is a significant input into the accrued performance allocation calculation and accrual for potential repayment of previously received performance allocations. estimates and assumptions are made when determining the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds. see "- fair value" below for further discussion related to significant estimates and assumptions used for determining fair value of the underlying investments.
fair value blackstone uses fair value throughout the reporting process. for a description of our accounting policies related to valuation, see note 2. "summary of significant accounting policies - fair value of financial instruments" and "summary of significant accounting policies - investments at fair value" in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" in "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this filing. the following discussion is intended to provide supplemental information about how the application of fair value principles impact our financial results, and management's process for implementing those principles including areas of significant judgment.
the fair value of the investments held by blackstone funds is the primary input to the calculation of certain of our management fees, incentive fees, performance allocations and the related compensation we recognize. the blackstone funds are accounted for as investment companies under the american institute of certified public accountants accounting and auditing guide, investment companies, and in accordance with the gaap guidance on investment companies and reflect their investments, including majority-owned and controlled investments (the "portfolio companies"), at fair value. in the absence of observable market prices, we utilize valuation methodologies applied on a consistent basis and assumptions that we believe market participants would use to determine the fair value of the investments. for investments where little market activity exists management's determination of fair value is based on the best information available in the circumstances, which may incorporate management's own assumptions and involves a significant degree of judgment, and the consideration of a combination of internal and external factors, including the appropriate risk adjustments for non-performance and liquidity risks.
blackstone has also elected the fair value option for certain instruments it owns directly, including loans and receivables and investments in private debt securities, the assets of consolidated clo vehicles and other proprietary investments. blackstone is required to measure certain financial instruments at fair value, including debt instruments, equity securities and freestanding derivatives.
fair value of investments or instruments that are publicly traded securities that are publicly traded and for which a quoted market exists will be valued at the closing price of such securities in the principal market in which the security trades, or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market on the valuation date. when a quoted price in an active market exists, no block discounts or control premiums are permitted regardless of the size of the public security held. in some cases, securities will include legal and contractual restrictions limiting their purchase and sale for a period of time, such as may be required under sec rule 144 or by underwriters in certain transactions. a discount to publicly traded price may be appropriate in those cases; the amount of the discount shall be determined based on the time period that must pass before the restricted security becomes unrestricted or otherwise available for sale.
fair value of investments or instruments that are not publicly traded investments for which market prices are not observable include private investments in the equity or debt of operating companies or real estate properties. our primary methodology for determining the fair values of such investments is the income approach which provides an indication of fair value based on the present value of cash flows that a business, security, or property is expected to generate in the future. the most widely used methodology under the income approach is the discounted cash flow method which includes significant assumptions about the underlying investment's projected net earnings or cash flows, discount rate, capitalization rate and exit multiple. our secondary methodology, generally used to corroborate the results of the income approach, is the market approach. the most widely used methodology under the market approach relies upon valuations for comparable public companies, transactions, or assets, and includes making judgments about which companies, transactions, or assets are comparable.
in certain cases debt and equity securities are valued on the basis of prices from an orderly transaction between market participants provided by reputable dealers or pricing services. in determining the value of a particular investment, pricing services may use certain information with respect to transactions in such investments, quotations from dealers, pricing matrices and market transactions in comparable investments and various relationships between investments.
management process on fair value due to the importance of fair value throughout the consolidated financial statements and the significant judgment required to be applied in arriving at those fair values, we have developed a process around valuation that incorporates several levels of approval and review from both internal and external sources. blackstone fund investments are valued on a quarterly basis by our internal valuation teams, which are independent from our investment teams.
for investments valued utilizing the income method and where blackstone has information rights, we generally have a direct line of communication with each of the portfolio company finance teams and collect financial data used to support projections used in a discounted cash flow analysis. the respective businesses' valuation team then analyzes the data received and updates the valuation models reflecting any changes in the underlying cash flow projections, weighted-average cost of capital, exit multiple, and any other valuation input relevant economic conditions.
the results of all valuations of investments held by blackstone fund and investment vehicles are reviewed and approved by the relevant business unit's valuation sub-committee, which is comprised of key personnel from the business unit, typically the chief investment officer, chief operating officer, chief financial officer, chief compliance officer (or their respective equivalents where applicable) and other senior managing directors in the business. to further corroborate our results, we also generally obtain either a positive assurance opinion or a range of value by an independent valuation party, at least annually for all investments and quarterly for certain investments. our firmwide valuation committee, chaired by our chief financial officer and comprised of senior heads of our businesses and representatives from legal and finance, reviews the valuation process for investments held by us and our investment vehicles, including the application of appropriate valuation standards on a consistent basis. each quarter, the valuations of the investment portfolios of blackstone funds are presented to the audit committee of our board of directors, which is comprised of our non-employee directors.
income tax for a description of our accounting policy on taxes and additional information on taxes see note 2. "summary of significant accounting policies" and note 15. "income taxes", respectively, in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" in "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this filing.
our provision for income taxes is composed of current and deferred taxes. current income taxes approximate taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period. deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the applicable enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse. during the current year, the conversion resulted in a step-up in the tax basis of certain assets that will be recovered as those assets are sold or the basis is amortized. the final amount of the step-up in tax basis may differ as the basis information becomes available and is finalized.
additionally, significant judgment is required in estimating the provision for (benefit from) income taxes, current and deferred tax balances (including valuation allowance), accrued interest or penalties and uncertain tax positions. in evaluating these judgments, we consider, among other items, projections of taxable income (including the character of such income), beginning with historic results and incorporating assumptions of the amount of future pretax operating income. these assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates that blackstone uses to manage its business. a portion of the deferred tax assets are not considered to be more likely than not to be realized due to the character of income necessary for recovery. for that portion of the deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance has been recorded.
revisions in estimates and/or actual costs of a tax assessment may ultimately be materially different from the recorded accruals and unrecognized tax benefits, if any.
off-balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business, we engage in off-balance sheet arrangements, including transactions in derivatives, guarantees, commitments, indemnifications and potential contingent repayment obligations. we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that would require us to fund losses or guarantee target returns to investors in our funds.
further disclosure on our off-balance sheet arrangements is presented in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" in "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this filing as follows:
•   note 9. "variable interest entities", and
•   note 19. "commitments and contingencies - commitments - investment commitments" and "- contingencies - guarantees".
recent accounting developments information regarding recent accounting developments and their impact on blackstone can be found in note 2. "summary of significant accounting policies" in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" in "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this filing.
interbank offered rates transition certain jurisdictions are currently reforming or phasing out their interbank offered rates ("ibors"), including, without limitation, the london interbank offered rates, euro interbank offered rate, tokyo interbank offered rate, hong kong interbank offered rate and singapore interbank offered rate. the timing of the anticipated reforms or phase-outs vary by jurisdiction, with most of the reforms or phase-outs currently scheduled to take effect at the end of calendar year 2021. we are actively evaluating operational and other impacts of such changes and managing transition efforts accordingly. see "part i. item 1a. risk factors - risks related to our business - interest rates on our and our portfolio companies' outstanding financial instruments might be subject to change based on regulatory developments, which could adversely affect our revenue, expenses and the value of those financial instruments."

blackstone operating entities contractual obligations                                                         $4,159,572                   $604,219                     $911,932             $6,898,795                            $12,574,518
(a)   we lease our primary office space and certain office equipment under agreements that expire through 2030. occupancy lease agreements, in addition to contractual rent payments, generally include additional payments for certain costs incurred by the landlord, such as building expenses and utilities. to the extent these are fixed or determinable they are included in the table above. the table above includes operating leases that are recognized as operating lease liabilities, short-term leases that are not recorded as operating lease liabilities and leases that have been signed but not yet commenced which are not recorded as operating lease liabilities. the amounts in this table are presented net of contractual sublease commitments.
(c)   represents interest to be paid over the maturity of our senior notes and borrowings under our revolving credit facility which has been calculated assuming no pre-payments are made and debt is held until its final maturity date. these amounts exclude commitment fees for unutilized borrowings under our revolver.
(e)   represents interest to be paid over the maturity of the related consolidated blackstone funds' and clo vehicles' debt obligations which has been calculated assuming no pre-payments will be made and debt will be held until its final maturity date. the future interest payments are calculated using variable rates in effect as of december 31, 2019, at spreads to market rates pursuant to the financing agreements, and range from 2.6% to 8.4%. the majority of the borrowings are due on demand and for purposes of this schedule are assumed to mature within one year. interest on the majority of these borrowings rolls over into the principal balance at each reset date.
(f)   these obligations represent commitments of the consolidated blackstone funds to make capital contributions to investee funds and portfolio companies. these amounts are generally due on demand and are therefore presented in the less than one year category.
(g)   represents obligations by blackstone's corporate subsidiary to make payments under the tax receivable agreements to certain non-controlling interest holders for the tax savings realized from the taxable purchases of their interests in connection with the reorganization at the time of blackstone's ipo in 2007 and subsequent purchases. the obligation represents the amount of the payments currently expected to be made, which are dependent on the tax savings actually realized as determined annually without discounting for the timing of the payments. as required by gaap, the amount of the obligation included in the consolidated financial statements and shown in note 18. "related party transactions" (see "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data") differs to reflect the net present value of the payments due to certain non-controlling interest holders.
(h)   the total represents gross unrecognized tax benefits of $0.5 million and interest and penalties of $0.5 million. in addition, blackstone is not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with gross unrecognized benefits of $24.5 million and interest of $2.2 million; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligations table.
(i)   these obligations represent commitments by us to provide general partner capital funding to the blackstone funds, limited partner capital funding to other funds and blackstone principal investment commitments. these amounts are generally due on demand and are therefore presented in the less than one year category; however, a substantial amount of the capital commitments are expected to be called over the next three years. we expect to continue to make these general partner capital commitments as we raise additional amounts for our investment funds over time.
guarantees blackstone and certain of its consolidated funds provide financial guarantees. the amounts and nature of these guarantees are described in note 19. "commitments and contingencies - contingencies - guarantees" in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" in "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this filing.
indemnifications in many of its service contracts, blackstone agrees to indemnify the third party service provider under certain circumstances. the terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in our consolidated financial statements as of december 31, 2019.
clawback obligations performance allocations are subject to clawback to the extent that the performance allocations received to date with respect to a fund exceeds the amount due to blackstone based on cumulative results of that fund. the actual clawback liability, however, generally does not become realized until the end of a fund's life except for certain blackstone real estate funds, multi-asset class investment funds and credit-focused funds, which may have an interim clawback liability. the lives of the carry funds, including available contemplated extensions, for which a liability for potential clawback obligations has been recorded for financial reporting purposes, are currently anticipated to expire at various points through 2028. further extensions of such terms may be implemented under given circumstances.
for financial reporting purposes, when applicable, the general partners record a liability for potential clawback obligations to the limited partners of some of the carry funds due to changes in the unrealized value of a fund's remaining investments and where the fund's general partner has previously received performance allocation distributions with respect to such fund's realized investments.
as of december 31, 2019, the total clawback obligations were $126.9 million, of which $105.3 million was related to blackstone holdings and $21.6 million was related to current and former blackstone personnel. the split of clawback between blackstone holdings and current and former personnel is based on the performance of individual investments held by a fund rather than on a fund by fund basis. if, at december 31, 2019, all of the investments held by our carry funds were deemed worthless, a possibility that management views as remote, the amount of performance allocations subject to potential clawback would be $7.2 billion, on an after-tax basis where applicable, of which blackstone holdings is potentially liable for $6.6 billion if current and former blackstone personnel default on their share of the liability, a possibility that management also views as remote. see note 18. "related party transactions" and note 19. "commitments and contingencies" in the "notes to consolidated financial statements" in "- item 8. financial statements and supplementary data" of this filing.

item 1a. risk factors risk factors investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk, and you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10-k. if any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer, possibly materially. in that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline.
risks related to our business all of our product revenues and the vast majority of our total revenues are derived from sales of medicines for the treatment of cf. if we are unable to continue to increase revenues from sales of our cf medicines, our business would be materially harmed and the market price of our common stock would likely decline.
our net product revenues and the vast majority of our total revenues are derived from the sale of cf medicines. as a result, our future success is dependent upon our ability to increase revenues from sales of our cf medicines. this will require us to gain approval and reimbursement for our triple combination therapy in ex-u.s. markets and successfully develop and commercialize our triple combination therapy for patients with cf less than 12 years of age.
our concentrated source of revenues presents a number of risks to our business, including:
•   that one or more competing therapies may successfully be developed as a treatment for patients with cf;
•   that reimbursement policies of payors and other third parties may make it difficult to obtain reimbursement or reduce the net price we receive for our products;
•   that we may experience manufacturing or supply disruptions for our cf medicines; and
•   that we may experience adverse developments with respect to development or commercialization of our cf medicines and/or cf drug candidates.
if one or more of the above risks were to materialize, if we are otherwise unable to increase or maintain revenues from sales of our cf medicines, or if we do not meet the expectations of investors or public equity market analysts, our business would be materially harmed and our ability to fund research and development programs for the discovery and development or acquisition of new products would be harmed, which would limit our ability to diversify our revenue base and our stock price would likely be adversely affected.
we are investing significant resources in the research and development of therapies for serious diseases other than cf, and if we are unable to successfully commercialize one or more of these therapies, our business could be materially harmed.
we are investing significant resources in the research and development of medicines for serious diseases including alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, apol1-mediated kidney diseases, pain, beta-thalassemia, sickle cell disease, type 1 diabetes, dmd and dm1. some of these programs have progressed into early-stage clinical trials, while others are still in pre-clinical development. product development is highly uncertain and expensive, and product candidates that may appear promising in the early phases of research and development may fail to reach commercial success for many reasons, including the failure to demonstrate acceptable clinical trial results or obtain marketing approval, the inability to manufacture or commercialize the product candidate on economically feasible terms, or the appearance of safety issues. even if we gain marketing approval for one or more pipeline products, we cannot be sure that we will obtain market acceptance or adequate reimbursement levels from third-party payors or foreign governments for such products.
additionally, many of the therapies that we are developing in our pipeline target rare diseases with a limited number of patients.  there can be no guarantee that we will effectively identify patients that are eligible for enrollment in our clinical trials or treatment with our drug candidates. even if we do successfully identify eligible patients, the number of patients that our drug candidates are able to treat may turn out to be lower than we expect or new patients may become increasingly difficult to identify, each of which may adversely affect our revenues and materially harm our business. for these and other reasons, we may never be successful in expanding our pipeline and future revenue may continue to depend on sales of our cf medicines.
we have experienced challenges commercializing products outside of the united states, and our future revenues will be dependent on our ability to obtain adequate reimbursement for our products.
in most ex-u.s. markets, the pricing and reimbursement of therapeutic and other pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control. given recent global economic pressures and geopolitical uncertainty, government authorities throughout the world are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of drug products. the reimbursement process in ex-u.s. markets can take a significant period of time and reimbursement decisions are made on a country-by-country basis.
our medicines treat life-threatening conditions and address relatively small patient populations and our research and development programs are primarily focused on developing medicines to treat similar diseases. particular attention is being paid by payors, including government and private payors, to these types of medicines given the relative higher cost of these products as compared to other types of pharmaceutical products, and countries are increasingly refusing to reimburse costly medicines. we have experienced challenges in obtaining reimbursement for orkambi in various countries outside the united states, including the united kingdom and france. for example, we obtained reimbursement for orkambi and symkevi in england in the fourth quarter of 2019, four years after orkambi's initial approval in 2015. our future product revenues, including from orkambi, symkevi, and trikafta, depend on, among other things, our ability to complete reimbursement discussions in ex-u.s. markets for our products. there is no assurance that coverage and reimbursement will be available outside of the united states for our cf or future medicines, and, even if it is available, whether the timing or the level of reimbursement will be sufficient to allow us to market our medicines. adverse pricing limitations or a delay in obtaining coverage and reimbursement would decrease our future net product revenues and harm our business.
if our competitors bring drugs with superior product profiles to market, our drugs may not be competitive and our revenues could decline.
a number of companies are seeking to identify and develop drug candidates for the treatment of cf and other therapeutic areas we are targeting with our research and development activities. our success in rapidly developing and commercializing our cf medicines may increase the resources that our competitors allocate to the development of potential competitive treatments. if one or more competing therapies are successfully developed as a treatment for patients with cf or any of the other diseases we are currently targeting in our pipeline, our products and our net product revenues could face competitive pressures. if one or more competing therapies prove to be superior to our then existing products and/or drug candidates, our business could be materially adversely affected.
in addition, our business faces competition from major pharmaceutical companies possessing substantially greater financial resources than we possess. we also face competition from numerous smaller public and private companies, academic institutions, government agencies, public and private research organizations and charitable venture philanthropy organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and/or establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization.
mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. smaller and other early-stage companies also may prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. these third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
our products and any drugs that we develop in the future may not be able to compete effectively with marketed drugs or new drugs that may be developed by competitors. the risk of competition is particularly important to our company because substantially all of our revenues as well as our most advanced drug candidates are related to the treatment of patients with cf. there are many other companies developing drugs for the same patient populations that we are pursuing. in order to compete successfully in these areas, we must demonstrate improved safety, efficacy and/or tolerability, ease of manufacturing, and gain and maintain market acceptance over competing drugs.
if we discover safety issues with any of our products or if we fail to comply with continuing u.s. and applicable foreign regulations, commercialization efforts for the product could be negatively affected, the approved product could lose its approval or sales could be suspended, and our business could be materially harmed.
our products are subject to continuing regulatory oversight, including the review of additional safety information. drugs are more widely used by patients once approval has been obtained and therefore side effects and other problems may be observed after approval that were not seen or anticipated, or were not as prevalent or severe, during pre-approval clinical trials or nonclinical studies. the subsequent discovery of previously unknown or underestimated problems with a product could negatively affect commercial sales of the product, result in restrictions on the product or lead to the withdrawal of the product from the market. three of our commercial products are combination products, and each of our products shares at least one active pharmaceutical ingredient with another of our products. as a result, if any of our cystic fibrosis products were to experience safety issues, our other cystic fibrosis products may be adversely affected. the reporting of adverse safety events involving our products or public speculation about such events could cause our stock price to decline or experience periods of volatility.
in addition, we and our third-party manufacturers must comply with gmp and other applicable regulations governing the manufacturing and distribution of our products. regulatory authorities periodically inspect our drug manufacturing facilities, and those of our third-party manufacturers, to evaluate compliance with gmp requirements.
if we or our collaborators, or third-parties acting on our behalf, fail to comply with applicable continuing regulatory requirements, we or our collaborators may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals for specific products, product recalls and seizures, operating restrictions and/or criminal prosecutions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.
if physicians and patients do not accept our drugs, or if patients do not remain on treatment or comply with their prescribed dosing regimen, our product revenues would be materially harmed in future periods.
our drugs may not gain or maintain market acceptance among physicians and patients. effectively marketing our drugs and any of our drug candidates, if approved, requires substantial efforts, both prior to launch and after approval. physicians may elect not to prescribe our drugs, and patients may elect not to take them or may discontinue use of our drugs after initiation of treatment, for a variety of reasons including:
•   prevalence and severity of adverse side effects;
•   lack of reimbursement availability from third-party payors, including governmental entities;
•   lower demonstrated efficacy, safety and/or tolerability compared to alternative treatment methods;
•   lack of cost-effectiveness;
•   a decision to wait for the approval of other therapies in development that have significant perceived advantages over our drug;
•   other potential advantages of alternative treatment methods; and
•   ineffective sales, marketing and/or distribution support.
if our drugs fail to achieve or maintain market acceptance, we may not be able to generate significant revenues in future periods.
government and other third-party payors seek to contain costs of health care through legislative and other means. if they fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement rates for our products, our revenues will be harmed.
our sales of products depend in part upon the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. third-party payors include government health programs such as medicare and medicaid in the united states and the national health care systems in many international markets, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. the trend in the health care industry is cost containment, and efforts of third-party payors to contain or reduce health care costs may adversely affect our ability to establish or maintain appropriate prices for our products or any drugs that we may develop and commercialize. in most ex-u.s. markets, the pricing and reimbursement of therapeutic and other pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control, and such government authorities are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of drug products. in the united states, there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to implement governmental controls that are similar to those that currently exist in europe. for example, the aca required manufacturers of medicare part d brand name drugs to provide discounts on those drugs to medicare part d beneficiaries during the coverage gap; increased the rebates paid by pharmaceutical companies to state medicaid programs on drugs covered by medicaid; and imposed an annual fee, which increases annually, on sales by branded pharmaceutical manufacturers.
third-party payors throughout the world also have been attempting to control drug spending through various other actions. in reimbursement negotiations, many payers are imposing price discounts and caps on total expenditures, and limiting both the types and variety of drugs that they will cover if they are not able to secure them. as part of these negotiations, many ex-u.s. government payers also are requiring companies to establish product cost-effectiveness as a condition of reimbursement and companies' data-backed explanations are assessed by government agencies set up for this purpose. these cost-effectiveness reviews may not account for many of the benefits provided by innovative medicines, and for the most part, have not taken into account the specific circumstances of products that treat rare diseases. this has led to conclusions that certain medicines, including our products in certain jurisdictions, are not cost effective. as a result, certain countries have declined to reimburse, or delayed their reimbursement of, some of our products. although not mandated in the united states, various organizations have started advocating for cost-effectiveness analyses in the united states. if u.s. payors were to adopt such assessments and make negative coverage determinations, it could adversely affect our product revenues.
there is also an increase in laws, regulations, and activity related to drug pricing and drug pricing transparency. in the united states, various states, including nevada, maryland, louisiana, new york, california, washington, massachusetts, connecticut, and oregon, have passed legislation requiring companies to disclose significant amounts of information, including information relating to drug prices, drug price increases, and spending on research, development, and marketing. although it is not clear what states ultimately will do with the information collected, some laws were designed to obtain additional product discounts, and we likely will continue to see more state action, which could require further disclosures or other actions.
complying with these laws requires significant personnel and operational resources and deters focus on our business. additionally, any additional required discounts would adversely affect the pricing of, and revenues from, our products. finally, while we seek to comply with all statutory and regulatory requirements, we face increased enforcement activity by the u.s. federal government, state governments, and private payors against pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for pricing and reimbursement-related issues.
in addition, in the united states and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals and initiatives to change the health care system in ways that could affect our ability to sell products. for example, in the united states, there have been ongoing federal legislative and administrative efforts as well as legal challenges seeking to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the aca. tax legislation enacted at the end of 2017 eliminated the tax penalty for individuals who do not maintain sufficient health insurance coverage beginning in 2019. the bipartisan budget act of 2018 contained various provisions that affect coverage and reimbursement of drugs, including an increase in the discount that manufacturers of medicare part d brand name drugs must provide to medicare part d beneficiaries during the coverage gap from 50% to 70%, which started in 2019. there are also a number of bills pending in congress that would affect drug pricing in the medicare and medicaid programs, and hhs recently issued a proposed rule and fda issued guidance on how pharmaceuticals could be imported into the united states from canada. as a result, there is uncertainty regarding future changes in the laws and regulations applicable to the health care system and the effect any such changes may have on our business. some of these proposed and implemented reforms have resulted, or could result, in reduced reimbursement rates and/or more limited access for our current or future products, which would adversely affect our business, operations and financial results.
the increasing availability and use of innovative specialty pharmaceuticals for rare diseases, combined with their relative higher cost as compared to other types of pharmaceutical products, is generating significant third-party payor interest in developing cost-containment strategies targeted to this sector. government regulations in both u.s. and ex-u.s. markets could further limit the prices that can be charged for our products and may limit our commercial opportunity. the increasing use of cost-effectiveness assessments in markets around the world and the financial challenges faced by many governments may lead to significant adverse effects on our business.
any legislation or regulatory changes or relaxation of laws that restrict imports of drugs from other countries, revisions to reimbursement or pharmaceuticals under government programs or general budget control actions also could reduce the net price we receive for our products.
we have limited experience developing genetic and cell-based therapies and could experience challenges with these programs, which could result in delays or prevent the development and commercialization of our genetic and cell-based therapies.
we are investing significant financial and other resources in the research and development of genetic and cell-based therapies.  while we have previously successfully developed, manufactured and commercialized several small molecule drugs, we have limited experience with the development, manufacture and commercialization of genetic and cell-based therapies.  development and commercialization of genetic and cell-based therapies are subject to all of the same risks and uncertainties as development and commercializing small molecules.  in addition:
•   the manufacturing processes for genetic and cell-based therapies are typically more complex and challenging than the manufacturing processes required for small molecule drugs, require different systems, equipment and facilities and require different expertise to develop and maintain;
•   there have been a limited number of fda approvals for genetic therapies to date, the regulatory requirements governing genetic therapies are continuing to evolve and current and future regulatory positions and interpretations could lead to delays with respect to our genetic therapy programs; and
•   our cell-based therapies include approaches involving devices, which are subject to additional regulatory requirements.
if we are not able to successfully develop or commercialize genetic or cell-based therapies, we will not realize benefits or generate cash flows based on our investments in these programs.
if regulatory authorities interpret any of our conduct, including our marketing practices, as being in violation of applicable health care laws, including fraud and abuse laws, laws prohibiting off-label promotion, disclosure laws or other similar laws, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties.
we are subject to health care fraud and abuse laws, such as the federal false claims act and anti-kickback laws, which prohibit off-label product promotion and other similar laws and regulations both in united states and in non-u.s. markets. while we have a corporate compliance program which, together with our policies and procedures, is designed to actively identify, prevent and mitigate risk through the implementation of compliance policies and systems and the promotion of a culture of compliance, if we are found not to be in full compliance with these laws and regulations, our business could be materially harmed.
the federal anti-kickback law prohibits knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the ordering, furnishing, arranging for or recommending of an item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a federal health care program, such as medicare or medicaid. the federal statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, patients, purchasers and formulary managers on the other hand, and therefore constrains our marketing practices and our various service arrangements with physicians, including physicians who make clinical decisions to use our products. although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and have been interpreted by courts as such.
federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of alleged promotional and marketing activities, such as providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product; reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then used by federal programs to set reimbursement rates; engaging in promotion for uses that the fda has not approved, known as "off-label" uses, that caused claims to be submitted to medicaid for those off-label uses; submitting inflated "best price" information to the medicaid rebate program; and certain manufacturing-related violations. the scope of this and other laws may expand in ways that make compliance more difficult and expensive.
although physicians are permitted, based on their medical judgment, to prescribe products for indications other than those approved by the fda, manufacturers are prohibited from promoting their products for such off-label uses. we market our products to eligible cf patients for whom the applicable product has been approved and provide promotional materials and training programs to physicians regarding the use of each product in these patient populations. these eligible patients do not represent all patients with cf. if the fda determines that our promotional materials, training or other activities constitute off-label promotion, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or other activities, conduct corrective advertising or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions, including the issuance of a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine and criminal penalties. it also is possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they believe that the alleged improper promotion led to the submission and payment of claims for an off-label use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. even if it is later determined we were not in violation of these laws, we may be faced with negative publicity, incur significant expenses defending our actions and have to divert significant management resources from other matters.
in recent years, legislation has been adopted at the federal, state and local level requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports or make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials, health care provider payments and other activities. for example, as part of the aca, the federal government enacted the physician payments sunshine act (referred to as the sunshine act). the sunshine act requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to report annually to the centers for medicare and medicaid services payments or other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals (and additional categories of health care practitioners beginning with reports submitted on or after january 1, 2022). we also now have similar reporting obligations throughout the european union, or the e.u. we expended significant efforts to establish, and are continuing to devote significant resources to maintain and enhance, systems and processes in order to comply with these regulations. requirements to track and disclose financial interactions with health care providers and organizations increase government and public scrutiny of these financial interactions. failure to comply with the reporting requirements could result in significant civil monetary penalties.
the sales and marketing practices of our industry have been the subject of increased scrutiny from governmental entities in the united sates and other countries in which we market our products, and we believe that this trend will continue. the risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are subject to a variety of interpretations. if our past or present operations are found to be in violation of any such laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from federal health care programs and/or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against them, also could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management's attention from the operation of our business.
there is also enhanced scrutiny of company-sponsored patient assistance programs, including insurance premium and co-pay assistance programs and donations to third-party charities that provide such assistance. if we, or our vendors or donation recipients are deemed to fail to comply with relevant laws, regulations or government guidance in the operation of these programs, we could be subject to significant fines and penalties.
if we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the medicaid drug rebate program or other governmental pricing programs in the u.s., we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.
we participate in the medicaid drug rebate program and a number of other federal and state government pricing programs in the u.s. in order to obtain coverage for our products by certain government health care programs. these programs would generally require us to pay rebates or provide discounts to certain private purchasers or government payers in connection with our products when dispensed to beneficiaries of these programs. in some cases, such as with the medicaid drug rebate program, the rebates are based on pricing and rebate calculations that we report on a monthly and quarterly basis to the government agencies that administer the programs. the terms, scope and complexity of these government pricing programs change frequently. we may also have reimbursement obligations or be subject to penalties if we fail to provide timely and accurate information to the government, pay the correct rebates or offer the correct discounted pricing. changes to the price reporting or rebate requirements of these programs would affect our obligations to pay rebates or offer discounts. responding to current and future changes may increase our costs and the complexity of compliance, will be time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
we are subject to various and evolving laws and regulations governing the privacy and security of personal information, and our failure to comply could adversely affect our business, result in fines and/or criminal penalties, and damage our reputation.
we are subject to data privacy and security laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that apply to the collection, transmission, storage and use of personal information, including health information, and impose significant compliance obligations. in addition, numerous other federal and state laws, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, disclosure and security of personal information. the legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business. for example, the e.u. general data protection regulation, or gdpr, went into effect in may 2018 and has imposed new obligations on us with respect to our processing of personal data and the cross-border transfer of such data, including higher standards of obtaining consent, more robust transparency requirements, data breach notification requirements, requirements for contractual language with our data processors, and stronger individual data rights. in the united states, california has passed the california consumer privacy act, which went into effect on january 1, 2020, and several states and the federal government are actively considering proposed legislation governing the protection of personal data. additionally, brazil has passed the general data protection law (lgpd), which is set to go into effect in august 2020. while we continue to address the implications of the new data privacy regulations, data privacy remains an evolving landscape at both the domestic and international level, with new regulations coming into effect and continued legal challenges and our efforts to comply with the evolving data protection rules may be unsuccessful. each law is also subject to various interpretations by courts and regulatory agencies, creating even more uncertainty.
we must devote significant resources to understanding and complying with this changing landscape. failure to comply with laws regarding data protection would expose us to risk of enforcement actions taken by data protection authorities, private rights of action in some jurisdictions, and the potential for significant penalties if we are found to be non-compliant. for example, failure to comply with the gdpr and applicable national data protection laws of european economic area member states could lead to fines of up to €20,000,000 or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual revenue of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. some of these laws and regulations also carry the possibility of criminal sanctions. for example, while we are not directly subject to the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996, as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act, or hipaa, we could be subject to penalties, including criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information from a hipaa-covered health care provider or research institution that has not complied with hipaa's requirements for disclosing such information. even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could harm our business and our reputation.
the ema has adopted a policy on publication of clinical data whereby it will publish clinical reports submitted as part of maas for drugs. the ema aims to publish reports within 60 days after a decision on the application has been made by the european commission. the ability of third-parties to review and/or analyze the raw data from our clinical trials may increase the risk of patient confidentiality breaches and could result in enhanced scrutiny of our clinical trials results. such scrutiny could result in misconceptions being spread about our drugs and drug candidates, even if the underlying analysis of such review turns out to be flawed. these publications could also result in the disclosure of information to our competitors that we might otherwise deem confidential, which could harm our competitive position.
the use of social media platforms presents risks and challenges.
social media is being used by third parties to communicate about our products and drug candidates and the diseases our therapies are designed to treat. we believe that members of the cf community may be more active on social media as compared to other patient populations due to the demographics of this patient population. social media practices in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are evolving, which creates uncertainty and risk of noncompliance with regulations applicable to our business. for example, patients may use social media platforms to comment on the effectiveness of, or adverse experiences with, a drug or a drug candidate, which could result in reporting obligations. in addition, our employees may engage on social media in ways that may not comply with our social media policy or with legal or regulatory requirements, which may give rise to liability, lead to the loss of trade secrets and other intellectual property, or result in public disclosure of protected personal information. there is a risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us on any social networking website. certain data protection regulations, such as the gdpr in the eu, also apply to personal data contained on social media. if any of these events were to occur or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could incur liability, face restrictive regulatory actions or incur other harm to our business, including damage to our reputation.
risks related to development, clinical testing and regulation of our products and drug candidates our drug candidates remain subject to clinical testing and regulatory approval. our future success is dependent on our ability to successfully develop additional drug candidates for both cf and non-cf indications.
our business depends upon the successful development and commercialization of drug candidates. these drug candidates are in various stages of development and must satisfy rigorous standards of safety and efficacy before they can be approved for sale by the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. to satisfy these standards, we must allocate resources among our various development programs and must engage in expensive and lengthy testing of our drug candidates. discovery and development efforts for new pharmaceutical products, including new combination therapies, are resource-intensive and may take 10 to 15 years or longer for each drug candidate. despite our efforts, our drug candidates may not:
•   offer therapeutic or other improvement over existing competitive therapies;
•   show the level of safety and efficacy, including the level of statistical significance, required by the fda or other regulatory authorities for approval of a drug candidate;
•   meet applicable regulatory standards;
•   be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at acceptable costs; or
•   if approved for commercial sale, be successfully marketed as pharmaceutical products.
we have recently completed and/or have ongoing or planned clinical trials for several of our drug candidates. the strength of our company's product portfolio and pipeline will depend in large part upon the outcomes of these clinical trials, including clinical trials evaluating our triple combination therapy in younger patients with cf and our earlier-stage clinical trials of potential medicines to treat other diseases. results of our clinical trials and findings from our nonclinical studies, including toxicology findings in nonclinical studies conducted concurrently with clinical trials, could lead to abrupt changes in our development activities, including the possible cessation of development activities associated with a particular drug candidate or program.
moreover, clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations, and many companies that have believed their drug candidates performed satisfactorily in clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their drug candidate. furthermore, results from our clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance or otherwise provide the level of evidence or safety and efficacy required by the fda or other regulatory authorities for approval of a drug candidate.
many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including our company, have suffered significant setbacks in later-stage clinical trials even after achieving promising results in earlier-stage clinical trials. for example, the results from completed preclinical studies and clinical trials may not be replicated in later clinical trials, and ongoing clinical trials for our drug candidates may not be predictive of the results we may obtain in later-stage clinical trials or of the likelihood of approval of a drug candidate for commercial sale. in addition, from time to time we report interim data from our clinical trials. interim data from a clinical trial may not be predictive of final results from the clinical trial.
if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval, we will be unable to commercialize our drug candidates.
the time required to complete clinical trials and to satisfy the fda and other countries' regulatory review processes is uncertain and typically takes many years. our analysis of data obtained from nonclinical and clinical activities is subject to confirmation and interpretation by regulatory authorities, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. we also may encounter unanticipated delays or increased costs due to government regulation from future legislation or administrative action or changes in governmental policy during the period of drug development, clinical trials and governmental regulatory review.
we may seek a fast track and/or breakthrough therapy designation for some of our drug candidates. drug candidates that receive one or both of these designations may be eligible for, among other things, a priority regulatory review. each of these designations is within the discretion of the fda. accordingly, even if we believe one of our drug candidates meets the criteria for fast track and/or breakthrough therapy designation, the fda may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. the receipt of one or both of these designations for a drug candidate does not guarantee a faster development process, review or approval compared to drugs developed or considered for approval under conventional fda procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the fda. in addition, even if one or more of our drugs or drug candidates qualifies for fast track and/or breakthrough therapy designation, the fda may later decide to withdraw such designation if it determines that the drug or drug candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification.
any failure to obtain regulatory approvals for a drug candidate would prevent us from commercializing that drug candidate. any delay in obtaining required regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our ability to successfully commercialize a drug candidate. furthermore, any regulatory approval to market a drug may be subject to limitations that we do not expect on the indicated uses for which we may market the drug. any such limitations could reduce the size or demand of the market for the drug.
we also are subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing authorization, pricing and third-party reimbursement. non-u.s. jurisdictions have different approval procedures than those required by the fda, and these jurisdictions may impose additional testing requirements for our drug candidates. the foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with the fda approval process described above, as well as risks attributable to the satisfaction of foreign requirements. approval by the fda does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities outside the united states and approval by a foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by the fda. in addition, although the fda may accept data from clinical trials conducted outside the united states, acceptance of this data is subject to conditions imposed by the fda. for example, the clinical trial must be well designed and conducted and performed by qualified investigators in accordance with ethical principles. the trial population also must adequately represent the u.s. population, and the data must be applicable to the u.s. population and u.s. medical practice in ways that the fda deems clinically meaningful. in addition, while these clinical trials are subject to applicable local laws, fda acceptance of the data will depend on its determination that the trials also complied with all applicable u.s. laws and regulations. if the fda does not accept the data from any trial that we conduct outside the united states, it would likely result in the need for additional trials, which would be costly and time-consuming and delay or permanently halt our development of the applicable drug candidate.
if clinical trials are prolonged or delayed, our development timelines for the affected development program could be extended, our costs to develop the drug candidate could increase and the competitive position of the drug candidate could be adversely affected.
we cannot predict whether or not we will encounter problems with any of our completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials that will cause us or regulatory authorities to delay or suspend clinical trials, or delay the analysis of data from our completed or ongoing clinical trials. among the factors that could delay our development programs are:
•   ongoing discussions with the fda or comparable foreign authorities regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials and the number of clinical trials we must conduct;
•   delays in enrolling volunteers or patients into clinical trials, including as a result of low numbers of patients that meet the eligibility criteria for the trial;
•   the need to repeat clinical trials as a result of inconclusive results, unforeseen complications in testing or clinical investigator error;
•   inadequate supply or deficient quality of drug candidate materials or other materials necessary for the conduct of our clinical trials;
•   unfavorable fda or foreign regulatory authority inspection and review of a manufacturing facility that supplied clinical trial materials or its relevant manufacturing records or a clinical trial site or records of any clinical or preclinical investigation;
•   serious and unexpected drug-related side-effects experienced by participants in our clinical trials or by participants in clinical trials being conducted by our competitors to evaluate drug candidates with similar mechanisms of action or structures to drug candidates that we are developing;
•   favorable results in testing of our competitors' drug candidates, or fda or foreign regulatory authority approval of our competitors' drug candidates; or
•   action by the fda or a foreign regulatory authority to place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on a trial or compound or deeming the clinical trial conduct as problematic.
our ability to enroll patients in our clinical trials in sufficient numbers and on a timely basis is subject to a number of factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the availability of effective treatments for the relevant disease, the number of other clinical trials ongoing and competing for patients in the same indication and the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial. in addition, patients may drop out of our clinical trials or may be lost to follow-up medical evaluation after treatment ends, and this could impair the validity or statistical significance of the trials. delays in patient enrollment or unforeseen drop-out rates may result in increased costs and longer development times.
we, our collaborators, the fda or other applicable regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials of a drug candidate at any time if we or they believe the healthy volunteers or patients participating in such clinical trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or for other reasons. any such suspension could materially adversely affect the development of a particular drug candidate and our business.
if our processes and systems are not compliant with regulatory requirements, we could be subject to restrictions on marketing our products or could be delayed in submitting regulatory filings seeking approvals for our drug candidates.
we have a number of regulated processes and systems that are required both prior to and following approval of our drugs and drug candidates. these processes and systems are subject to continual review and periodic inspection by the fda and other regulatory bodies. in addition, the clinical research organizations and other third parties that we work with in our non-clinical studies and clinical trials and our oversight of such parties are subject to similar reviews and periodic inspection by the fda and other regulatory bodies. if compliance issues are identified at any point in the development and approval process, we may experience delays in filing for regulatory approval for our drug candidates, or delays in obtaining regulatory approval after filing, if at all. any later discovery of previously unknown problems or safety issues with approved drugs or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in restrictions on such drugs or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of drugs from the market, the imposition of civil or criminal penalties or a refusal by the fda and/or other regulatory bodies to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new drugs or supplements to approved applications, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. in addition, we are party to agreements that transfer responsibility for complying with specified regulatory requirements, such as filing and maintenance of marketing authorizations and safety reporting or compliance with manufacturing requirements, to our collaborators and third-party manufacturers. if our collaborators or third-party manufacturers do not fulfill these regulatory obligations, any drugs for which we or they obtain approval may be subject to later restrictions on manufacturing or sale, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
risks related to business development activities our ability to execute on our long-term strategy depends in part on our ability to engage in transactions and collaborations with other entities that add to our pipeline or provide us with new commercial opportunities.
in order to achieve our long-term business objectives, we seek to license or acquire drugs, drug candidates and other technologies that have the potential to complement our ongoing research and development efforts, access emerging technologies and license or acquire pipeline assets with a focus on early-stage assets. we have faced and will continue to face significant competition for the acquisition of rights to these types of drugs, drug candidates and other technologies from a variety of other companies, many of which have significantly more financial resources and experience in business development activities than we have. in addition, non-profit organizations may be willing to provide capital to the companies that control additional drugs, drug candidates or technologies, which may provide incentives for companies to advance these drugs, drug candidates or technologies independently. also, the cost of acquiring, in-licensing or otherwise obtaining rights to such drugs, drug candidates or other technologies has grown dramatically in recent years and may be at levels that we cannot afford or that we believe are not justified by market potential. as a result, we may not be able to acquire, in-license or otherwise obtain rights to additional drugs, drug candidates or other technologies on acceptable terms or at all.
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions of business or technologies, and the integration following any such acquisition may disrupt our business and management.
it is challenging to effectively integrate businesses and technologies that we acquire, including the acquisitions of semma and exonics and exclusive licenses that we have acquired from crispr, and we may not realize the benefits anticipated from such transactions. achieving the anticipated benefits of any transaction and successfully integrating acquired businesses or technologies involves a number of risks, including:
•   failure to successfully develop and commercialize the acquired drugs, drug candidates or technologies or to achieve other strategic objectives;
•   delays or inability to progress preclinical programs into clinical development or unfavorable data from clinical trials evaluating the acquired or licensed drug or drug candidates;
•   difficulty in integrating the drugs, drug candidates, technologies, business operations and personnel of an acquired asset or company;
•   disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and employees from daily operations or other opportunities and challenges;
•   entry into markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience or where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions;
•   potential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant problems, liabilities or challenges of an acquired company, or acquired or licensed drug, drug candidate or technology, including but not limited to, problems, liabilities or challenges with respect to intellectual property, clinical or non-clinical data, safety, accounting practices, employee, or third party relations and other known and unknown liabilities;
•   liability for activities of the acquired company or licensor before the acquisition or license, including intellectual property infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities;
•   exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of an acquisition or license, including but not limited to, claims from terminated employees, customers, former equity holders or other third-parties; and
•   difficulties in the integration of the acquired company's departments, systems, including accounting, human resource and other administrative systems, technologies, books and records, and procedures, as well as in maintaining uniform standards, controls, including internal control over financial reporting required by the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 and related procedures and policies.
acquisitions, licensing arrangements and other strategic transactions are inherently risky, and ultimately, if we do not complete an announced acquisition, collaboration or strategic transaction or integrate an acquired or licensed asset, business or technology successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the benefits of the strategic transaction to the extent anticipated. additionally, we may later incur impairment charges related to assets acquired in any such transaction. for example, we entered into a strategic collaboration and license agreement with parion sciences, inc., or parion, to develop enac inhibitors in 2015 and incurred an impairment charge related to this collaboration in the third quarter of 2017. in addition, even if we achieve the long-term benefits associated with our strategic transactions, our expenses and short-term costs may increase materially and adversely affect our liquidity and short-term net income (loss). future strategic transactions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, the creation of contingent liabilities, impairment expenses related to goodwill, or impairment or amortization expenses related to other intangible assets, all of which could harm our financial condition.
we face risks in connection with existing and future collaborations with respect to the development, manufacture and commercialization of our products and drug candidates.
the risks that we face in connection with our current collaborations, including crispr, and any future collaborations, include the following:
•   our collaborators may change the focus of their development and commercialization efforts or may have insufficient resources to effectively develop our drug candidates. the ability of some of our products and drug candidates to reach their potential could be limited if collaborators decrease or fail to increase development or commercialization efforts related to those products or drug candidates. our collaboration agreements provide our collaborators with a level of discretion in determining the amount and timing of efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations.
•   collaboration agreements may have the effect of limiting the areas of research and development that we may pursue, either alone or in collaboration with third parties.
•   collaborators may develop and commercialize, either alone or with others, drugs that are similar to or competitive with the drugs or drug candidates that are the subject of their collaborations with us.
•   disagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development, might cause delays or termination of the research, development or commercialization of drug candidates, might lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to drug candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration. any such disagreements would divert management attention and resources and be time-consuming and expensive.
•   collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation.
•   collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability.
•   investigations and/or compliance or enforcement actions against a collaborator, which may expose us to indirect liability as a result of our partnership with such collaborator.
additionally, if a collaborator were to be involved in a business combination with a third party, it might deemphasize or terminate the development or commercialization of any drug candidate licensed to it by us. if one of our collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may find it more difficult to attract new collaborators and our perception in the business and financial communities could be harmed.
we may not be able to attract collaborators or external funding for the development and commercialization of certain of our drug candidates.
as part of our ongoing strategy, we may seek additional collaborative arrangements or external funding for certain of our development programs and/or seek to expand existing collaborations to cover additional commercialization and/or development activities. we have a number of research programs and early-stage clinical development programs, some of which are being developed in collaboration with a third party. for example, we have an ongoing collaboration with janssen, pursuant to which janssen is developing pimodivir, a drug candidate for the treatment of influenza we discovered. at any time, we may determine that in order to continue development of a drug candidate or program or successfully commercialize a drug we need to identify a collaborator or amend or expand an existing collaboration. whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator's resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator's evaluation of a number of factors. those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the fda, ema or other regulatory authorities, the potential market for the subject drug candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such drug candidate to patients, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of the applicable intellectual property, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge, and industry and market conditions generally. potentially, and depending on the circumstances, we may desire that a collaborator either agree to fund portions of a drug development program led by us, or agree to provide all of the funding and directly lead the development and commercialization of a program. no assurance can be given that any efforts we make to seek additional collaborative arrangements will be successfully completed on a timely basis or at all. if we elect to fund and undertake development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. if we are unable to enter into acceptable collaborative relationships, one or more of our development programs could be delayed or terminated and the possibility of our receiving a return on our investment in the program could be impaired.
risks related to third-party manufacturing and reliance on third parties we depend on third-party manufacturers to manufacture our products and the materials we require for our clinical trials. we may not be able to maintain these relationships and could experience supply disruptions outside of our control.
we rely on a worldwide network of third-party manufacturers to manufacture our drugs for commercial use and our drug candidates for clinical trials. as a result of our reliance on these third-party manufacturers and suppliers, we could be subject to significant supply disruptions outside of our control. our supply chain for sourcing raw materials and manufacturing drug product ready for distribution is a multi-step international endeavor. third-party contract manufacturers, including some in china, perform different parts of our manufacturing process. contract manufacturers may supply us with raw materials, convert these raw materials into drug substance and/or convert the drug substance into final dosage form. third parties are used for packaging, warehousing and distribution of products. establishing and managing this global supply chain requires a significant financial commitment and the creation and maintenance of numerous third-party contractual relationships. although we attempt to manage the business relationships with companies in our supply chain, we do not have control over their operations. supply disruptions may result from a number of factors, including shortages in product raw materials, labor or technical difficulties, regulatory inspections or restrictions, shipping or customs delays or any other performance failure by any third-party manufacturer on which we rely. any supply disruptions could disrupt sales of our products and/or the timing of our clinical trials.
we require a supply for our medicines for commercial sale and a supply of our drug candidates for use in our clinical trials. while we have developed some internal capabilities, a majority of the manufacturing steps needed to produce our drug candidates and drug products are performed through a third-party manufacturing network. to ensure the stability of our supply chains we aim to develop additional sources of manufacture for all steps of our manufacturing processes at the time of, or shortly after, marketing approval. therefore, at any point in time, we may have a limited number of single source manufacturers for certain steps in our manufacturing processes, particularly for recently launched products.
if we or our third-party manufacturers become unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing product and we are not able to promptly identify another manufacturer, we could experience a disruption in the commercial supply of our then-marketed medicines, which would have a significant effect on patients, our business and our product revenues. similarly, a disruption in the clinical supply of drug products could delay the completion of clinical trials and affect timelines for regulatory filings. there can be no assurance that we will be able to establish and maintain secondary manufacturers for all of our drug candidates and drug products on a timely basis or at all.
in the course of providing its services, a contract manufacturer may develop process technology related to the manufacture of our products or drug candidates that the manufacturer owns, either independently or jointly with us. this would increase our reliance on that manufacturer or require us to obtain a license from that manufacturer in order to have our products or drug candidates manufactured by other suppliers utilizing the same process.
we rely on third parties to conduct pre-clinical work, clinical trials and other activities, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet established deadlines for the completion of such studies and/or trials or failing to satisfy regulatory requirements.
we rely on third parties such as contract research organizations to help manage certain pre-clinical work and our clinical trials and on medical institutions, clinical investigators and clinical research organizations such as the therapeutic development network, which is primarily funded by the cff, to assist in the design and review of, and to conduct our clinical trials, including enrolling qualified patients. in addition, we engage third party contractors to support numerous other research, commercial and administrative activities. our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities but does not relieve us of our responsibilities. for example, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the clinical trial. moreover, the fda requires us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as good laboratory practices and good clinical practices, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of pre-clinical and clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected.
if these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be required to replace them. although we believe that there are a number of other third-party contractors we could engage to continue the activities, it may result in a delay of the affected clinical trial, drug development program or applicable activity. if clinical trials are not conducted in accordance with our contractual expectations or regulatory requirements, action by regulatory authorities might significantly and adversely affect the conduct or progress of these clinical trials or in specific circumstances might result in a requirement that a clinical trial be redone. accordingly, our efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for and commercialize our drug candidates could be delayed. in addition, failure of any third party contractor to conduct activities in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect the relevant research, development, commercial or administrative activity.
risks related to intellectual property if our patents do not protect our drugs or our drugs infringe third-party patents, we could be subject to litigation which could result in injunctions preventing us from selling our products or substantial liabilities.
we have numerous issued patents and pending patent applications in the united states, as well as counterparts in other countries. our success will depend, in significant part, on our ability to obtain and defend u.s. and foreign patents covering our drugs, their uses and our processes, to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. we cannot be certain that any patents will issue from our pending patent applications or, even if patents issue or have issued, that the issued claims will provide us with adequate protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable.
due to evolving legal standards relating to the patentability, validity and enforceability of patents covering pharmaceutical inventions and the scope of claims made under these patents, our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce patents is uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. recent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents in the u.s. the leahy-smith america invents act, or the leahy-smith act, includes a number of significant changes to united states patent law. these include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. the united states patent office developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the leahy-smith act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the leahy-smith act, and in particular, the first to file provisions, became effective in march 2013. the first to file provisions limit the rights of an inventor who is the first to invent an invention but is not the first to file an application claiming that invention. u.s. and foreign patent applications typically are maintained in confidence for a period of time after they initially are filed with the applicable patent office. consequently, we cannot be certain that we were the first to invent, or the first to file patent applications on, our products or drug candidates or their use. if a third party also has filed a u.s. patent application relating to our drugs or drug candidates, their uses, or a similar invention, we may have to participate in legal or administrative proceedings to determine priority of invention. for applications governed by the lahey-smith act, if a third-party has an earlier filed u.s. patent application relating to our drugs or drug candidates, their uses, or a similar invention, we may be unable to obtain an issued patent from our application.
the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability. our patents may be challenged by third parties, resulting in the patent being deemed invalid, unenforceable or narrowed in scope, or the third party may circumvent any such issued patents. also, our pending patent applications may not issue, and we may not receive any additional patents. our patents might not contain claims that are sufficiently broad to prevent others from utilizing our technologies. for instance, the issued patents relating to our drugs or drug candidates may be limited to a particular molecule or molecules and may not cover similar molecules that have similar clinical properties. consequently, our competitors may independently develop competing products that do not infringe our patents or other intellectual property. in addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future products.
the laws of many foreign jurisdictions do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the united states and many companies in our segment of the pharmaceutical industry have encountered significant difficulties in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. if we encounter such difficulties in protecting or are otherwise precluded from effectively protecting our intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions, our business could be substantially harmed.
because of the extensive time required for the discovery, development, testing and regulatory review of drug candidates, it is possible that a patent may expire before a drug candidate can be commercialized, or a patent may expire or remain in effect for only a short period following commercialization of such drug candidate. this would result in a minimal or non-existent period of patent exclusivity. if our drug candidates are not commercialized significantly ahead of the expiration date of any applicable patent, or if we have no patent protection on such drug candidates, then, to the extent available we would rely on other forms of exclusivity, such as regulatory exclusivity provided by the fdca and its counterpart agencies in various jurisdictions, and/or orphan drug exclusivity.
uncertainty over intellectual property in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry has been the source of litigation and other disputes, which is inherently costly and unpredictable.
there is considerable uncertainty within our industry about the validity, scope and enforceability of many issued patents in the united states and elsewhere in the world, and, to date, the law and practice remains in substantial flux both in the agencies that grant patents and in the courts. we cannot currently determine the ultimate scope and validity of patents which may be granted to third parties in the future or which patents might be asserted as being infringed by the manufacture, use and sale of our products.
there has been, and we expect that there may continue to be, significant litigation in the pharmaceutical industry regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. litigation, arbitrations, administrative proceedings and other legal actions with private parties and governmental authorities concerning patents and other intellectual property rights may be protracted, expensive and distracting to management. competitors may sue us as a way of delaying the introduction of our drugs or to remove our drugs from the market. any litigation, including litigation related to abbreviated new drug applications, or anda, litigation related to 505(b)(2) applications, interference proceedings to determine priority of inventions, derivations proceedings, inter partes review, oppositions to patents in foreign countries, litigation against our collaborators or similar actions, may be costly and time consuming and could harm our business. we expect that litigation may be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our proprietary rights. litigation may be necessary in other instances to determine the validity, scope or non-infringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our products. ultimately, the outcome of such litigation could adversely affect the validity and scope of our patent or other proprietary rights, hinder our ability to manufacture and market our products, or result in the assessment of significant monetary damages against us that may exceed amounts, if any, accrued in our financial statements.
to the extent that valid present or future third-party patents or other intellectual property rights cover our drugs, drug candidates or technologies, we or our strategic collaborators may seek licenses or other agreements from the holders of such rights in order to avoid or settle legal claims. such licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, which may hinder our ability to, or prevent us from being able to, manufacture and market our drugs. payments under any licenses that we are able to obtain would reduce our profits derived from the covered products.
many of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee's former employer. litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.
in addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. our and their assignment agreements may not be self-executing or may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.
if we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.
risks related to our operations risks associated with operating in foreign countries could materially adversely affect our business.
we have expanded our international operations over the past several years in order to market our cf medicines and expand our research and development capabilities. new laws and industry codes in the e.u. and elsewhere have expanded transparency requirements regarding payments and transfers of value as well as patient-level clinical trial data and have expanded protections related to personal data and provided for increased sanctions for violations. collectively, our expansion and these new requirements are adding to our compliance costs and expose us to potential sanctions for failing to meet the enhanced safeguards and reporting demands in these jurisdictions. in addition, a significant portion of our commercial supply chain, including sourcing of raw materials and manufacturing, is located in china and the e.u. consequently, we are, and will continue to be, subject to risks related to operating in foreign countries, including risks relating to intellectual property protections and business interruptions. these risks are increased with respect to countries such as china that have substantially different local laws and business practices and weaker protections for intellectual property. risks associated with operating a global biotechnology company include:
•   differing regulatory requirements for drug approvals and regulation of approved drugs in foreign countries;
•   varying reimbursement regimes and difficulties or the inability to obtain reimbursement for our products in foreign countries in a timely manner;
•   differing patient treatment infrastructures, particularly since our business is focused on the treatment of serious diseases that affect relatively smaller numbers of patients and are typically prescribed by specialist physicians;
•   collectibility of accounts receivable;
•   changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements, the risks of which appear to have increased in the current political environment;
•   economic weakness, including recession and inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;
•   differing levels of enforcement and/or recognition of contractual and intellectual property rights;
•   complying with local laws and regulations, which are interpreted and enforced differently across jurisdictions and which can change significantly over time;
•   foreign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;
•   foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in reduced revenues or increased operating expenses, and other obligations incident to doing business or operating in another country;
•   workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the united states;
•   import and export licensing requirements, tariffs, and other trade and travel restrictions;
•   global or regional public health emergencies that could affect our operations or business;
•   production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and
•   business interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism.
our revenues are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to the global nature of our operations. although we have foreign currency forward contracts to hedge forecasted product revenues denominated in foreign currencies, our efforts to reduce currency exchange losses may not be successful. as a result, currency fluctuations among our reporting currency, the u.s. dollar, and the currencies in which we do business will affect our operating results, often in unpredictable ways.
in addition, our international operations are subject to regulation under u.s. law. for example, the fcpa prohibits u.s. companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad. in many countries, the health care professionals we regularly interact with may meet the definition of a foreign government official for purposes of the fcpa. we also are subject to import/export control laws. failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences, including the possible delay in approval or refusal to approve a product, recalls, seizures, withdrawal of an approved product from the market, the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions, the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations and corresponding bad publicity and negative perception of our company in foreign countries.
if we fail to manage our operations effectively, our business may suffer.
we have expanded and are continuing to expand our global operations and capabilities, which has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our management and our operational, research and development and financial infrastructure. to effectively manage our business, we need to:
•   implement and clearly communicate our corporate-wide strategies;
•   enhance our operational and financial infrastructure, including our controls over records and information;
•   enhance our operational, financial and management processes, including our cross-functional decision-making processes and our budget prioritization systems;
•   enhance our compliance and legal resources.
our business faces potential risks relating to the united kingdom's withdrawal from the european union.
our european headquarters and european research facility are located in the united kingdom, or the u.k., and a significant portion of our ex-u.s. net product revenues are derived from sales in the u.k. on january 31, 2020, the u.k. formally withdrew from the e.u. ("brexit") and began a transition period set to end on december 31, 2020. during the transition period, the u.k. and the e.u. will negotiate their future relationship, including the terms of trade. the effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the u.k. makes to retain access to e.u. markets, either during the transitional period or more permanently. brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the u.k. determines which e.u. laws to replace or replicate. given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the u.k. from the e.u. would have and how such withdrawal would affect us. any of these effects of brexit, among others, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
our business has a substantial risk of product liability claims and other litigation liability. if we do not obtain appropriate levels of insurance, any potential claims could adversely affect our business.
we are or may be involved in various legal proceedings, including securities/shareholder matters and claims related to product liability, intellectual property and breach of contract. such proceedings may involve claims for, or the possibility of, damages or fines and penalties involving substantial amounts of money or other relief, including but not limited to civil or criminal fines and penalties. if any of these legal proceedings were to result in an adverse outcome, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.
with respect to product liability and clinical trial risks, in the ordinary course of business we are subject to liability claims and lawsuits, including potential class actions, alleging that our products or drug candidates have caused, or could cause, serious adverse events or other injury. we have product liability insurance and clinical trial insurance in amounts that we believe are adequate to cover this risk. however, our insurance may not provide adequate coverage against all potential liabilities. if a claim is brought against us, we might be required to pay legal and other expenses to defend the claim, as well as pay uncovered damage awards resulting from a claim brought successfully against us and these damages could be significant and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. furthermore, whether or not we are ultimately successful in defending any such claims, we might be required to direct significant financial and managerial resources to such defense and adverse publicity is likely to result.
a breakdown or breach of our information technology systems could subject us to liability or interrupt the operation of our business.
we maintain and rely extensively on information technology systems and network infrastructures for the effective operation of our business. in the course of our business, we collect, store and transmit confidential information (including personal information and intellectual property), and it is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information. the size and complexity of our information technology and information security systems makes such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions and to security breaches. a disruption, infiltration or failure of our information technology systems or any of our data centers as a result of software or hardware malfunctions, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, employee theft or misuse, power disruptions, natural disasters, floods or accidents could cause breaches of data security and loss of critical data, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business and subject us to both private and governmental causes of action. while we have implemented security measures in an attempt to minimize these risks to our data and information technology systems and have adopted a business continuity plan to deal with a disruption to our information technology systems, cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and have become increasingly difficult to detect. there can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our data and information systems will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business. in addition, our liability insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyber-attacks or other related liabilities.
if we fail to attract and retain skilled employees or manage our upcoming executive transition, our business could be materially harmed.
due to the highly technical nature of our drug discovery and development activities, we require the services of highly qualified and trained scientists who have the skills necessary to conduct these activities. in addition, we need to attract and retain employees with experience in marketing and commercialization of medicines. we have entered into employment agreements with some executives and provide stock-related compensation benefits to all of our key employees that vest over time and therefore induce them to remain with us. however, the employment agreements can be terminated by the executive on relatively short notice. the value to employees of stock-related benefits that vest over time - such as restricted stock units and stock options - can be significantly affected by movements in our stock price, and may, at any point in time, be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies. we face intense competition for our personnel from our competitors and other companies throughout our industry. we also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. moreover, the growth of local biotechnology companies and the expansion of major pharmaceutical companies into the boston area has increased competition for the available pool of skilled employees, especially in technical fields. the high cost of living in massachusetts can make it difficult to attract employees from other parts of the country to our massachusetts headquarters. in addition, the available pool of skilled employees would be further reduced if immigration laws change in a manner that increases restrictions on immigration. our ability to continue to commercialize our products and achieve our research and development objectives depends on our ability to respond effectively to these demands. if we are unable to hire and retain qualified personnel, there could be a material adverse effect on our business.
on april 1, 2020, dr. jeffrey leiden will transition to the role of executive chairman and dr. reshma kewalramani will become our president and chief executive officer. no assurance can be made about the impact that this transition in management will have on our business.
if we do not comply with laws regulating the protection of the environment and health and human safety, our business could be adversely affected.
our research and development efforts involve the regulated use of hazardous materials, chemicals and various controlled and radioactive compounds. although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by state, federal and foreign regulations, the risk of loss of, or accidental contamination or injury from, these materials cannot be eliminated. if an accident occurs, we could be held liable for resulting damages, which could be substantial. we also are subject to numerous environmental, health and workplace safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne pathogens and the handling of biohazardous materials. although we maintain workers' compensation insurance to cover us for costs we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of these materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. we maintain insurance to cover pollution conditions or other extraordinary or unanticipated events relating to our use and disposal of hazardous materials that we believe is appropriate based on the small amount of hazardous materials we generate. additional federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting our operations may be adopted in the future. we may incur substantial costs to comply with, and substantial fines or penalties if we violate, any of these laws or regulations.
if our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, our operations would be seriously harmed.
most of our operations, including our research and development activities, are conducted in a limited number of facilities. if any of our major facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, due to an earthquake, severe storms, fire or similar event, our operations could be seriously harmed. for example, our corporate headquarters, as well as additional leased space that we use for certain logistical and laboratory operations and manufacturing, are located in a flood zone along the massachusetts coast. we have adopted a business continuity plan to address most crises. however, if we are unable to fully implement our business continuity plans, we may experience delays in recovery of data and/or an inability to perform vital corporate functions, which could result in a significant disruption in our research, development, manufacturing and/or commercial activities, large expenses to repair or replace the facility and/or the loss of critical data, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
market prices for securities of companies such as ours are highly volatile. from january 1, 2019 to december 31, 2019, our common stock traded between $160.95 and $225.66 per share. the market for our stock, like that of other companies in the biotechnology industry, has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. the future market price of our securities could be significantly and adversely affected by factors such as:
•   the information contained in our quarterly earnings releases, including our net product revenues and operating expenses for completed periods and guidance regarding future periods;
•   announcements of fda actions with respect to our drugs or our competitors' drugs, or regulatory filings for our drug candidates or those of our competitors, or announcements of interim or final results of clinical trials or nonclinical studies relating to our drugs, drug candidates or those of our competitors;
•   developments in domestic and international governmental policy or regulation, for example, relating to drug pricing or intellectual property rights;
•   technological innovations or the introduction of new drugs by our competitors;
•   government regulatory action;
•   public concern as to the safety of drugs developed by us or our competitors;
•   developments in patent or other intellectual property rights or announcements relating to these matters;
•   information disclosed by third parties regarding our business or products;
•   developments relating specifically to other companies and market conditions for pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks or stocks in general;
•   business development, capital structuring or financing activities; and
•   general worldwide or national economic, political and capital market conditions.
following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, stockholder derivative lawsuits and securities class action litigation are common. such litigation, if instituted against us or our officers and directors, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources.
our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past, and we expect that they will continue to do so in the future. our revenues are primarily dependent on the level of net product revenues from sales of our cf medicines. our total net product revenues could vary on a quarterly basis based on, among other factors, the timing of orders from our significant customers. additional factors that have caused quarterly fluctuations to our operating results in recent years include variable amounts of revenues, expenses related to business development activities, changes in the fair value of our strategic investments, impairment charges, charges for excess and obsolete inventories, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments and the consolidation or deconsolidation of variable interest entities. our revenues also are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to the global nature of our operations. although we have foreign currency forward contracts to hedge forecasted product revenues denominated in foreign currencies, our efforts to reduce currency exchange losses may not be successful. as a result, currency fluctuations among our reporting currency, the u.s. dollar, and the currencies in which we do business may affect our operating results, often in unpredictable ways. our quarterly results also could be materially affected by significant charges, which may or may not be similar to charges we have experienced in the past. most of our operating expenses relate to our research and development activities, do not vary directly with the amount of revenues and are difficult to adjust in the short term. as a result, if revenues in a particular quarter are below expectations, we are unlikely to reduce operating expenses proportionately for that quarter. these examples are only illustrative and other risks, including those discussed in these "risk factors," could also cause fluctuations in our reported financial results. our operating results during any one period do not necessarily suggest the results of future periods.
we expect that results from our clinical development activities and the clinical development activities of our competitors will continue to be released periodically, and may result in significant volatility in the price of our common stock.
any new information regarding our products and drug candidates or competitive products or potentially competitive drug candidates can substantially affect investors' perceptions regarding our future prospects. we, our collaborators and our competitors periodically provide updates regarding drug development programs, typically through press releases, conference calls and presentations at medical conferences. these periodic updates often include interim or final results from clinical trials conducted by us or our competitors and/or information about our or our competitors' expectations regarding regulatory filings and submissions as well as future clinical development of our products or drug candidates, competitive products or potentially competitive drug candidates. the timing of the release of information by us regarding our drug development programs is often beyond our control and is influenced by the timing of receipt of data from our clinical trials and by the general preference among pharmaceutical companies to disclose clinical data during medical conferences. in addition, the information disclosed about our clinical trials, or our competitors' clinical trials, may be based on interim rather than final data that may involve interpretation difficulties and may in any event not accurately predict final results.
changes in tax laws, regulations and treaties could affect our future taxable income.
we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. as a result, our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various places that we operate globally.  our effective tax rate may be different than experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including changes in the mix of our profitability from country to country, the results of tax authority examinations/audits of our tax filings, adjustments to the value of our uncertain tax positions, changes in accounting for income taxes and changes in tax laws or modifications of treaties in various jurisdictions. any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations we continue to assess the impact of various tax reform proposals and modifications to existing tax treaties in all jurisdictions where we have operations to determine the potential effect on our business and any assumptions we have made about our future taxable income.  we cannot predict whether any specific proposals will be enacted, the terms of any such proposals or what effect, if any, such proposals would have on our business if they were to be enacted.
recommendations from the organization for economic co-operation and development that are part of the base erosion and profit shifting, or beps, framework could result in changes in tax laws in countries where we do business and adversely affect our provision for income taxes and our current rate. if these recommendations (or other changes in law) were adopted by the countries in which we do business, it could adversely affect our provision for income tax and our current rate.
we may need to raise additional capital that may not be available.
we may need to raise additional capital in the future. any potential public offering, private placement or debt financing may or may not be similar to the transactions that we entered into in the past. any debt financing may be on terms that, among other things, include conversion features that could result in dilution to our then-existing security holders and restrict our ability to pay interest and dividends-although we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. any equity financings would result in dilution to our then-existing security holders. if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be required to curtail significantly or discontinue one or more of our research, drug discovery or development programs, including clinical trials, incur significant cash exit costs, or attempt to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies, drugs or drug candidates. based on many factors, including general economic conditions, additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.
future indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, and the terms of our credit agreement impose restrictions on our business, reducing our operational flexibility and creating default risks.
in september 2019, we entered into a credit agreement providing for a $500 million revolving facility. the credit agreement provides that, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, we may request that the borrowing capacity under the credit agreement be increased by an additional $500.0 million. all outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement mature on september 17, 2024. if we borrow under our current credit agreements or any future credit agreement, such indebtedness could have important consequences to our business, including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse financial, business, economic and industry conditions, as well as other factors that are beyond our control. the credit agreement requires that we comply with certain financial covenants, including (i) a consolidated leverage ratio covenant and (ii) a consolidated interest coverage ratio covenant, in each case to be measured on a quarterly basis. further, the credit agreement includes negative covenants, subject to exceptions, restricting or limiting our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, engage in certain investment, acquisition and disposition transactions, pay dividends, repurchase capital stock and enter into transactions with affiliates. as a result, we may be restricted from engaging in business activities that may otherwise improve our business. failure to comply with the covenants could result in an event of default that could trigger acceleration of our indebtedness, which would require us to repay all amounts owing under the credit agreement and/or our capital leases and could have a material adverse effect on our business. additionally, our obligations under the credit agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries.
issuances of additional shares of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline.
as of december 31, 2019, we had 259.0 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding. as of december 31, 2019, we also had outstanding options to purchase 6.3 million shares of common stock with a weighted-average exercise price of $134.92 per share. outstanding vested options are likely to be exercised if the market price of our common stock exceeds the applicable exercise price, and, in the future, we expect to issue additional options and restricted stock units to directors and employees. in addition, we may issue additional common stock or restricted securities in the future as part of financing activities or business development activities and any such issuances may have a dilutive effect on our then-existing shareholders. sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the open market, or the availability of such shares for sale, could adversely affect the price of our common stock. the issuance of restricted common stock or common stock upon exercise of any outstanding options would be dilutive, and may cause the market price for a share of our common stock to decline.
our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of up to $500 million to repurchase shares of our common stock. our stock repurchases will depend upon, among other factors, our cash balances and potential future capital requirements, results of operations, financial condition and other factors that we may deem relevant. we can provide no assurance that we will repurchase stock at favorable prices, if at all.
we have adopted anti-takeover provisions and are subject to massachusetts corporate laws that may frustrate any attempt to remove or replace our current management or effectuate a business combination involving vertex.
our corporate charter and by-law provisions and massachusetts state laws may discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change of control of vertex that might be beneficial to us or our security holders. our by-laws grant the directors a right to adjourn annual meetings of shareholders, and certain provisions of our by-laws may be amended only with an 80% shareholder vote. we may issue shares of any class or series of preferred stock in the future without shareholder approval and upon such terms as our board of directors may determine. the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any class or series of preferred stock that may be issued in the future. massachusetts state law prohibits us from engaging in specified business combinations, unless the combination is approved or consummated in a prescribed manner, and prohibits voting by any shareholder who acquires 20% or more of our voting stock without shareholder approval. as a result, shareholders or other parties may find it more difficult to remove or replace our current management.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we invest in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for people with serious diseases with a focus on specialty markets. we continue to focus on developing and commercializing therapies for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, or cf, and in 2019 we obtained approval in the united states, or u.s., for trikafta (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor). we are broadening our pipeline through internal research efforts and accessing external innovation through business development transactions.
we have four approved medicines that treat the underlying cause of cf, which is a life-threatening genetic disease. in october 2019, trikafta , our triple-combination regimen, was approved by the united states food and drug administration, or fda, for the treatment of patients with cf 12 years of age or older who have at least one f508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, or cftr, gene. this approval increased the number of patients eligible for our medicines in the u.s. by approximately 6,000 and provided an additional treatment option for many patients who are also eligible for one of our previously approved products. we have submitted a marketing authorization application, or maa, to the european medicines agency, or ema, for this triple combination regimen. our four medicines are collectively approved to treat approximately 60% of the 75,000 cf patients in north america, europe and australia. we are focused on obtaining approval for the triple combination in ex-u.s. markets for patients 12 years of age and older and evaluating our triple combination in younger patients, with the goal of having treatments for up to 90% of patients with cf. we are also pursuing other therapeutic approaches to address the remaining 10% of cf patients.
our small molecule programs include programs focused on developing treatments for alpha-1 antitrypsin, or aat, deficiency, apol1-mediated kidney diseases and pain. we are evaluating ctx001, a genetic therapy as a potential treatment for sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia, in a phase 1/2 clinical trial in collaboration with crispr therapeutics ag, or crispr. in 2019, through a series of strategic transactions, we established preclinical genetic therapy programs for duchenne muscular dystrophy, or dmd, and myotonic dystrophy type 1, or dm1, and a preclinical program to develop cell-based therapies for type 1 diabetes, or t1d.
financial highlights over the last three years, our product revenues have increased significantly and we have limited the growth of our expenses, which has allowed us to create significant operating margins and reinvest in our business.
revenues over the last three years, our net product revenues have increased as we obtained approvals for trikafta and symdeko/symkevi and expanded access to our medicines.
expenses our combined r&d and sg&a expenses increased from $1.97 billion in 2018 to $2.41 billion in 2019 primarily due to research expenses associated with our business development activities. in 2019, cost of sales was approximately 13.2% of our net product revenues.
balance sheet business highlights cystic fibrosis
•   obtained approval in october 2019 from the fda for trikafta for treatment of patients with cf 12 years of age and older who have at least one f508del mutation.
•   trikafta was approved approximately three months after we submitted the nda for the triple combination regimen and within four years of discovery of the final component of the triple combination regimen.
•   submitted a maa to the european medicines agency, or ema, for the triple combination of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor in patients 12 years of age and older.
•   obtained a positive opinion from the ema's committee for medicinal products for human use for kalydeco for infants as young as six months old.
•   obtained reimbursement of orkambi and/or symdeko/symkevi for eligible patients in several important ex-u.s. markets, including england, france, australia, scotland and spain.
•   aat deficiency: we initiated a phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial for vx-814, our first investigational oral small molecule corrector for the treatment of alpha-1 antitrypsin, or aat, deficiency, in order to evaluate vx-814 in patients with aat deficiency who have two copies of the z mutation. a phase 1 clinical trial of vx-864, a second investigational small molecule corrector for the treatment of aat deficiency, is ongoing in healthy volunteers.
•   apol1-mediated kidney disease: in the fourth quarter of 2019, we completed a phase 1 clinical trial evaluating vx-147, our first investigational oral small molecule for the treatment of apol1-mediated focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, or fsgs, and other serious kidney diseases, in healthy volunteers. we plan to initiate a phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial in 2020 to evaluate the reduction in protein levels with vx-147 in fsgs patients.
•   sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia: enrollment is ongoing in phase 1/2 clinical trials evaluating ctx001 for the treatment of severe sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia. along with our collaborator, crispr, we announced positive, interim data from the first two patients with these hemoglobinopathies treated with the investigational crispr/cas9 gene-editing therapy ctx001 in the ongoing phase 1/2 trials. we expect to provide additional data for this program in 2020.
•   pain: we plan to initiate clinical development of a novel nav1.8 inhibitor for the treatment of pain in the first half of 2020.
•   type 1 diabetes: acquired cell-based therapy programs that we are advancing as potential treatments for t1d by acquiring semma therapeutics. we plan to advance this program into clinical development in t1d patients in late 2020 or early 2021.
•   dmd and dm1: acquired exonics and expanded our collaboration with crispr in july 2019, in order to support a pre-clinical program to develop treatments for dmd and dm1.
research we are continuing to invest in our research programs and fostering scientific innovation in order to identify and develop transformative medicines. our strategy is to combine transformative advances in the understanding of human disease and the science of therapeutics in order to identify and develop new medicines. we believe that pursuing research in diverse areas allows us to balance the risks inherent in drug development and may provide drug candidates that will form our pipeline in future years. to supplement our internal research programs, we acquire technologies and programs and collaborate with biopharmaceutical and technology companies, leading academic research institutions, government laboratories, foundations and other organizations as needed to advance research in our areas of therapeutic interest and to access technologies needed to execute on our strategy.
drug discovery and development discovery and development of a new pharmaceutical product is a difficult and lengthy process that requires significant financial resources along with extensive technical and regulatory expertise. potential drug candidates are subjected to rigorous evaluations, driven in part by stringent regulatory considerations, designed to generate information concerning efficacy, side-effects, proper dosage levels and a variety of other physical and chemical characteristics that are important in determining whether a drug candidate should be approved for marketing as a pharmaceutical product. most chemical compounds that are investigated as potential drug candidates never progress into development, and most drug candidates that do advance into development never receive marketing approval. because our investments in drug candidates are subject to considerable risks, we closely monitor the results of our discovery, research, clinical trials and nonclinical studies and frequently evaluate our drug development programs in light of new data and scientific, business and commercial insights, with the objective of balancing risk and potential. this process can result in abrupt changes in focus and priorities as new information becomes available and as we gain additional understanding of our ongoing programs and potential new programs, as well as those of our competitors.
if we believe that data from a completed registration program support approval of a drug candidate, we submit an nda to the fda requesting approval to market the drug candidate in the united states and seek analogous approvals from comparable regulatory authorities in jurisdictions outside the united states. to obtain approval, we must, among other things, demonstrate with evidence gathered in nonclinical studies and well-controlled clinical trials that the drug candidate is safe and effective for the disease it is intended to treat and that the manufacturing facilities, processes and controls for the manufacture of the drug candidate are adequate. the fda and ex-u.s. regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in deciding whether or not a drug candidate should be granted approval based on the benefits and risks of the drug candidate in the treatment of a particular disease, and could delay, limit or deny regulatory approval. if regulatory delays are significant or regulatory approval is limited or denied altogether, our financial results and the commercial prospects for the drug candidate involved will be harmed.
regulatory compliance our marketing of pharmaceutical products is subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations. we have a corporate compliance program designed to actively identify, prevent and mitigate risk through the implementation of compliance policies and systems and through the promotion of a culture of compliance. among other laws, regulations and standards, we are subject to various u.s. federal and state laws, and comparable laws in other jurisdictions, pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws, and laws prohibiting the promotion of drugs for unapproved or off-label uses. anti-kickback laws generally make it illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to knowingly and willfully solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in return for or to induce the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug that is reimbursed by a state or federal health care program. false claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly or willfully presenting for payment to third-party payors, including medicare and medicaid, claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. we are subject to laws and regulations that regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as laws such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, which govern our international business practices with respect to payments to government officials. in addition, we are subject to various data protection and privacy laws and regulations in the u.s., e.u., canada, australia and other jurisdictions. we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to maintain, administer and expand these compliance programs globally.
reimbursement sales of our products depend, to a large degree, on the extent to which our products are reimbursed by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed health care organizations. we dedicate substantial management and other resources in order to obtain and maintain appropriate levels of reimbursement for our products from third-party payors, including governmental organizations in the united states and ex-u.s. markets.
in the united states, we have worked successfully with third party-payors in order to promptly obtain appropriate levels of reimbursement for our first three cf medicines and have begun working with these stakeholders to obtain reimbursement for trikafta. we plan to continue to engage in discussions with numerous commercial insurers and managed health care organizations, along with government health programs that are typically managed by authorities in the individual states, to ensure that payors recognize the significant benefits that our medicines provide by treating the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis and continue to provide access to our medicines.
in europe and other ex-u.s. markets, we seek government reimbursement for our medicines on a country-by-country basis. this is necessary for each new medicine, as well as, in most countries, label expansions for our current medicines. we successfully obtained reimbursement for kalydeco in each significant ex-u.s. market within two years of approval. we experienced significant challenges in obtaining reimbursement for orkambi in certain ex-u.s. markets. in the fourth quarter of 2019, we obtained reimbursement for orkambi and symkevi in the united kingdom and orkambi in france, four years after orkambi's initial approval in 2015. with this approval, we now have obtained reimbursement for orkambi or symkevi in most of our significant ex-u.s. markets. in some ex-u.s. markets, including ireland, denmark and australia, our reimbursement agreements include innovative arrangements that provide a pathway to access and rapid reimbursement for certain future cf medicines. we recently filed a maa with the ema for the triple combination regimen of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor and, if approved, we would need to seek government reimbursement on a country-by-country basis, in most european markets. in december 2019, we reached an agreement with the government in ireland to expand the existing reimbursement agreement to include the triple combination regimen pending approval by the ema.
strategic transactions acquisitions as part of our business strategy, we seek to acquire drugs, drug candidates and other technologies and businesses that have the potential to complement our ongoing research and development efforts. in 2019, we invested significantly in business development transactions designed to augment our pipeline. we expect to continue to identify and evaluate potential acquisitions that may be similar to or different from the transactions that we have engaged in previously.
in july 2019, we acquired exonics, a privately-held company focused on creating transformative gene-editing therapies to repair mutations that cause dmd and other severe neuromuscular diseases, including dm1. our acquisition of exonics enhanced our gene-editing capabilities and supports the potential development of novel therapies for dmd and dm1. in connection with the acquisition, we acquired all of the outstanding equity of exonics for an upfront payment of approximately $245.0 million plus customary working capital adjustments in cash, and certain potential future payments based primarily upon the successful achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones for the dmd and dm1 programs.
in october 2019, we acquired semma, a privately-held company focused on the use of stem cell-derived human islets as a potentially curative treatment for type 1 diabetes. our acquisition of semma advanced our cell therapy capabilities and supports the potential development of transformative therapies for t1d. in connection with the acquisition, we acquired all of the outstanding equity of semma for approximately $950.0 million in cash.
both of these acquisitions were accounted for as business combinations. as of the acquisition date for each transaction, the cash payments, as well as the fair value of contingent consideration for exonics, were allocated primarily to goodwill and the fair value of several in-process research and development assets that we acquired.  the fair value of contingent consideration related to exonics was recorded as a liability and will be adjusted on a quarterly basis in the future. as a result, these acquisitions are primarily reflected in additional assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.  operating expenses incurred by exonics and semma after the acquisition dates and specific expenses associated with the acquisitions are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations for 2019.
please refer to note c, "acquisitions," and our critical accounting policies, "acquisitions," for further information regarding the significant judgments and estimates related to our acquisitions.
collaboration and licensing arrangements we enter into arrangements with third parties, including collaboration and licensing arrangements, for the development, manufacture and commercialization of drugs, drug candidates and other technologies that have the potential to complement our ongoing research and development efforts. we expect to continue to identify and evaluate collaboration and licensing opportunities that may be similar to or different from the collaborations and licenses that we have engaged in previously.
in-license agreements we have entered into collaborations with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in order to acquire rights or to license drug candidates or technologies that enhance our pipeline and/or our research capabilities. over the last several years, we entered into collaboration agreements with:
•   arbor biotechnologies, inc., or arbor, pursuant to which we are collaborating on the discovery of novel proteins, including dna endonucleases, to advance the development of new gene-editing therapies.
•   crispr, pursuant to which we have been collaborating since 2015 on the discovery and development of potential new treatments aimed at the underlying genetic causes of human diseases using crispr-cas9 gene-editing technology. in 2019, we obtained the exclusive worldwide rights to crispr's intellectual property for dmd and dm1 gene-editing products through a new agreement with crispr.
•   kymera therapeutics, or kymera, pursuant to which we are looking to advance small molecule protein degraders against multiple targets.
•   molecular templates, inc., pursuant to which we are collaborating on the discovery and development of novel targeted conditioning regimens to enhance the hematopoietic stem cell transplant process.
generally, when we in-license a technology or drug candidate, we make upfront payments to the collaborator, assume the costs of the program and/or agree to make contingent payments, which could consist of milestone, royalty and option payments. most of these collaboration payments are expensed as research and development expenses; however, depending on many factors, including the structure of the collaboration, the significance of the drug candidate that we license to the collaborator's operations and the other activities in which our collaborators are engaged, the accounting for these transactions can vary significantly. our research and development expenses included $318.3 million in 2019, $111.9 million in 2018 and $168.7 million in 2017 related to upfront and milestone payments pursuant to our collaboration agreements.
upfront payments and expenses incurred in connection with the collaborations listed above are being expensed as research or development expenses because the collaboration represents a small portion of each of these collaborator's overall business. in contrast, parion sciences, inc., or parion, and bioaxone biosciences, inc., or bioaxone, with whom we previously collaborated, were historically accounted for as variable interest entities, or vies, and included in our consolidated financial statements. in 2017 and 2018, we determined that the requirements for consolidation were no longer met with respect to parion and bioaxone, respectively. as a result, we deconsolidated parion and bioaxone from our consolidated financial statements as of september 30, 2017 and december 31, 2018, respectively, and did not consolidate any vies in 2019.
a collaborator that we account for as a vie may engage in activities unrelated to our collaboration. the revenues and expenses unrelated to the programs we in-license from our vies have historically been immaterial to our consolidated financial statements. with respect to each of parion and bioaxone, the activities unrelated to our collaborations with these entities represented approximately 2% or less of our total revenues and total expenses on an annual basis during the periods that we consolidated these collaborators.
out-license agreements we also have out-licensed internally-developed programs to collaborators who are leading the development of these programs. these out-license arrangements include our agreements with:
•   janssen pharmaceuticals, inc., or janssen, which is evaluating pimodivir in phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of influenza; and
•   merck kgaa, darmstadt, germany, which licensed oncology research and development programs from us in early 2017.
pursuant to these out-licensing arrangements, our collaborators are responsible for the research, development and commercialization costs associated with these programs, and we are entitled to receive contingent milestone and/or royalty payments. as a result, we do not expect to incur significant expenses in connection with these programs and have the potential for future collaborative and royalty revenues resulting from these programs.

strategic investments in connection with our business development activities, we have periodically made equity investments in our collaborators. as of december 31, 2019, we held strategic equity investments in several public companies, including crispr, and certain private companies, and we plan to make additional strategic equity investments in the future. while we invest the majority of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in instruments that meet specific credit quality standards and limit our exposure to any one issue or type of instrument, our strategic investments are maintained and managed separately from our other cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.
until december 31, 2017, changes in the fair value of these strategic investments were reflected on our consolidated balance sheet, but did not affect our net income until the related gains or losses were realized. as a result of accounting guidance, effective january 1, 2018, changes in the fair value of equity investments with readily determinable fair values (including publicly traded securities such as crispr) were recorded to other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations in 2019 and 2018. for equity investments without readily determinable fair values including equity investments in private companies, each reporting period we are required to re-evaluate the carrying value of the investment, which may result in other income (expense).
in 2019 and 2018, we recorded within other income (expense), net gains of $197.6 million and $2.6 million related to changes in the fair value of our strategic investments and from sales of certain investments. to the extent that we continue to hold strategic investments, particularly strategic investments in publicly traded companies, we will record other income (expense) related to these strategic investments on a quarterly basis. due to the high volatility of stocks in the biotechnology industry, we expect the value of these strategic investments to fluctuate and that the increases or decreases in the fair value of these strategic investments will continue to have material impacts on our net income (expense) and our profitability on a quarterly and/or annual basis.

** not meaningful net income and income from operations our income from operations increased to $1.20 billion in 2019 compared to $635.2 million in 2018 and $123.2 million in 2017, primarily as a result of the approval of symdeko/symkevi in 2018 and trikafta in 2019, and continued strong net product revenues from kalydeco and orkambi. the increased net product revenues were partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses primarily attributable to increased cost of sales due to increased net product revenues and increased research expenses associated with our business development activities.
net income attributable to vertex in 2018 included a one-time non-cash benefit from income taxes of $1.56 billion resulting from our release of our valuation allowance. as a result of this one-time cash benefit in 2018, net income attributable to vertex was higher in 2018 than 2019 and 2017.
earnings per share in 2019, 2018 and 2017, net income attributable to vertex was $4.51, $8.09, $1.04, respectively, per diluted share. the higher diluted earnings per share in 2018 as compared to 2019 and 2017 was due primarily to the benefit from income taxes as a result of the release of our valuation allowance, which increased net income attributable to vertex by $6.03 per diluted share in 2018.
in 2019, our net product revenues increased by $1.12 billion as compared to 2018. in 2018, our net product revenues increased by $872.8 million as compared to 2017. the increase in total net product revenues in 2019 was primarily due to the increasing number of patients being treated with symdeko/symkevi, the october 2019 approval of trikafta in the united states, label expansions for kalydeco and orkambi and expanded access to our medicines in ex-u.s. markets. in 2019, 2018 and 2017, our net product revenues included product revenues of $1.1 billion, $682.4 million, and 501.8 million, respectively, from ex-u.s. markets.
we expect that our net product revenues will increase in 2020 due to increasing numbers of patients being treated with our medicines as a result of the approval of trikafta, label expansions for our previously approved products and expanded access to our medicines. trikafta increases the number of patients eligible for our medicines by providing the first treatment option for a significant number of patients with cf, and provides a new treatment option for many patients who are eligible for one of our previously approved medicines. as a result, the approval of trikafta in the united states is resulting in increased net product revenues as well as a shift of net product revenues from our previously approved products to trikafta.
trikafta trikafta was approved by the fda in october 2019. trikafta net product revenues were $420.1 million in 2019, all of which were recognized in the fourth quarter of 2019. we recently submitted a maa to the ema for the triple combination regimen of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor. we expect trikafta net product revenues will increase significantly in 2020 as compared to 2019.
symdeko/symkevi symdeko/symkevi net product revenues were $1.42 billion in 2019 as compared to $768.7 million in 2018. symdeko was approved by the fda in february 2018 and symkevi was approved in the european union in november 2018. in the fourth quarter of 2019, some patients in the united states began switching from symdeko to trikafta.
orkambi orkambi net product revenues were $1.33 billion in 2019, $1.26 billion in 2018 and $1.32 billion in 2017. we have continued to increase the number of patients eligible for orkambi through label expansions and additional ex-u.s. reimbursement arrangements. these increases in eligible patients have been offset by a portion of the patients who were being treated with orkambi switching to symdeko/symkevi or trikafta.
from 2015 into the fourth quarter of 2019, we distributed orkambi through early access programs in france. upon adopting asc 606, revenue from contracts with customers, in the first quarter of 2018, we began recognizing a portion of the amounts collected related to shipments of orkambi through early access programs as net product revenues, based on an estimated transaction price that reflected the consideration we expected to retain that would not be subject to a significant reversal in amounts recognized. prior to adopting asc 606, we had not recognized any net product revenues from sales of orkambi in france because the price was not fixed or determinable at the time of delivery. upon reaching an agreement with the french government for orkambi in the fourth quarter of 2019, including the final amount for orkambi distributed through early access programs, we recognized an adjustment to increase net product revenues related to prior period shipments of orkambi distributed through early access programs of $155.8 million. please refer to "critical accounting policies - revenue recognition" below for a discussion of our accounting treatment for our early access program for orkambi in france.
kalydeco kalydeco net product revenues were $991.1 million in 2019, $1.01 billion in 2018 and $844.6 million in 2017. kalydeco net product revenues in 2019 were similar to kalydeco net product revenues in 2018. the increases in 2018 as compared to 2017 were primarily due to additional patients being treated with kalydeco as we completed reimbursement discussions in various ex-u.s. jurisdictions and as we increased the number of patients eligible to receive kalydeco through label expansions.
collaborative and royalty revenues our collaborative and royalty revenues were $2.1 million, $9.3 million and $323.2 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. in 2017, our collaborative and royalty revenues included (i) $230.0 million in revenues related to a one-time upfront payment earned in 2017 from merck kgaa, darmstadt, germany, (ii) a $25.0 million milestone related to our license agreement with janssen for the treatment of influenza and (iii) $40.0 million in revenues related to upfront and milestone payments earned by one of our vies pursuant to a license agreement entered into with a third party. we were not a party to the license agreement between the vie and the third party, and we had no economic interest in either the license or these milestone payments. in 2017 through 2019, our collaborative and royalty revenues also include a small amount of revenues related to a cash payment we received in 2008 when we sold our rights to certain hiv royalties and reimbursements for research and development activities related to our collaborative arrangements.

** not meaningful cost of sales our cost of sales primarily consists of the cost of producing inventories that corresponded to product revenues for the reporting period, plus the third-party royalties payable on our net sales of our products. pursuant to our agreement with the cff, our tiered third-party royalties on sales of trikafta, symdeko/symkevi, kalydeco and orkambi, calculated as a percentage of net sales, range from the single digits to the sub-teens. as a result of the tiered royalty rate, which resets annually, our cost of sales as a percentage of net product revenues are lower at the beginning of each calendar year.
over the last several years, our cost of sales has been increasing primarily due to increased net product revenues. our costs of sales as a percentage of net product revenues has been approximately 13% for each of 2019, 2018 and 2017. in 2020, we expect our total cost of sales will increase due to expected increases in our net product revenues and our cost of sales as a percentage of total net product revenues will be similar to our cost of sales as a percentage of total net product revenues in 2019.

our research and development expenses include internal and external costs incurred for research and development of our drugs and drug candidates and expenses related to certain technology that we acquire or license through business development transactions. we do not assign our internal costs, such as salary and benefits, stock-based compensation expense, laboratory supplies and other direct expenses and infrastructure costs, to individual drugs or drug candidates, because the employees within our research and development groups typically are deployed across multiple research and development programs. these internal costs are significantly greater than our external costs, such as the costs of services provided to us by clinical research organizations and other outsourced research, which we allocate by individual program. all research and development costs for our drugs and drug candidates are expensed as incurred.
over the past three years, we have incurred $4.5 billion in research and development expenses associated with drug discovery and development. the successful development of our drug candidates is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risks. in addition, the duration of clinical trials may vary substantially according to the type, complexity and novelty of the drug candidate and the disease indication being targeted. the fda and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial requirements on the introduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products, typically requiring lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures, sampling activities and other costly and time-consuming procedures. data obtained from nonclinical and clinical activities at any step in the testing process may be adverse and lead to discontinuation or redirection of development activities. data obtained from these activities also are susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. the duration and cost of discovery, nonclinical studies and clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project and are difficult to predict. therefore, accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate costs to bring our drug candidates to market are not available.
in 2017, 2018 and 2019, costs related to our cf programs represented the largest portion of our development costs. any estimates regarding development and regulatory timelines for our drug candidates are highly subjective and subject to change. until we have data from phase 3 clinical trials, we cannot make a meaningful estimate regarding when, or if, a clinical development program will generate revenue and cash flow.

we expect to continue to invest in our research programs with a focus on identifying drug candidates with the goal of creating transformative medicines for serious diseases. our research expenses increased by 67% in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily as a result of a $196.2 million increase associated with our business development activities, as well as increased expenses related to additional headcount and increased infrastructure costs. in 2019, our business development activities included collaborative upfront and option payments to crispr, kymera and molecular templates, which are reflected in "collaboration and asset acquisition expenses" in the table above. the increase in salary and benefits in 2019 was primarily related to costs associated with our acquisitions of exonics and semma. in 2018, our research expenses increased as compared to 2017 primarily due to $111.6 million in expenses associated with our business development activities, including collaborative upfront payments of $65.0 million to merck kgaa, darmstadt, germany and $30.0 million to arbor.

** not meaningful our development expenses increased by $43.7 million, or 4%, in 2019 as compared to 2018 and decreased by $35.3 million, or 3%, in 2018 as compared to 2017. the increase in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily due to increased headcount and infrastructure costs to support our advancing pipeline and increased milestones related to our collaborative agreements, partially offset by decreased expenses related to our cf programs. the decrease in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to increased costs associated with clinical trial expenses, including phase 3 clinical trials evaluating elexacaftor as part of our triple combination regimen, which were more than offset by a $160.0 million payment to concert pharmaceuticals inc. in connection with the acquisition of vx-561 in 2017 for which there were no comparable expenses in 2018.
sales, general and administrative expenses increased by 18% in 2019 as compared to 2018, and by 12% in 2018 as compared to 2017. these increases were primarily due to increased global support for our medicines and incremental investment to support the launch of our triple combination regimen. we expect our sales, general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in 2020.
contingent consideration in 2019, the increase in the fair value of contingent consideration of $4.5 million was due to changes in market interest rates and the time value of money related to the contingent development and regulatory milestone payments resulting from our acquisition of exonics. there were no similar amounts in 2018 or 2017. in future periods, we expect the fair value of contingent consideration to increase or decrease based on, among other things, our estimates of the probability of achieving and the timing of these contingent development and regulatory milestone payments, as well as the time value of money changes in market interest rates.
restructuring expenses we did not record any restructuring expenses in 2019. restructuring income was insignificant in 2018. in 2017, we recorded restructuring expenses of $14.2 million, primarily related to our decision to consolidate our research activities into our boston, milton park and san diego locations and to close our research site in canada.
intangible asset impairment charge in 2018, we recorded a $29.0 million impairment charge related to vx-210 that was licensed from bioaxone in 2014. in 2017, we recorded a $255.3 million impairment charge related to parion's pulmonary enac platform that we licensed from parion in 2015 and a benefit from income taxes of $97.7 million related to this impairment charge. both of these impairment charges, and the related benefits from income taxes, were attributable to non-controlling interest because we consolidated these entities as vies. there were no corresponding intangible asset impairment charges in 2019.
other non-operating income (expense), net interest income interest income increased from $11.7 million in 2017 to $38.4 million in 2018 and $63.7 million in 2019, primarily due to an increase in our cash equivalents and marketable securities and prevailing market interest rates. our future interest income will be dependent on the amount of, and prevailing market interest rates on, our outstanding cash equivalents and marketable securities.
interest expense interest expense was $58.5 million in 2019, $72.5 million in 2018 and $69.3 million in 2017. the majority of our interest expense in these periods was related to imputed interest expense associated with our leased corporate headquarters in boston and our research site in san diego. on january 1, 2019, we adopted asc 842, leases, which resulted in a reduction in our imputed interest expense associated with these leases beginning in 2019. our future interest expense will be dependent on whether, and to what extent, we borrow amounts under our credit facility.
other income (expense), net in 2019, we recorded net other income of $192.2 million primarily related to changes in the fair value of our strategic investments. in 2018, we recorded net other expense of $0.8 million. in 2017, we recorded net other expense of $81.4 million primarily related to the deconsolidation of parion.
in 2019 and 2018, our other income (expense), net included realized and unrealized gains totaling $197.6 million and $2.6 million, respectively, related to our strategic investments. we expect that, due to the volatility of the stock price of biotechnology companies, our other income (expense), net will fluctuate in future periods based on increases or decreases in the fair value of our strategic investments.
noncontrolling interest (vies)
in 2019, we had no noncontrolling interest because we did not consolidate any vies into our consolidated statement of operations. in 2018 and 2017, the net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest recorded on our consolidated statements of operations reflects parion (through september 30, 2017) and bioaxone's (through december 31, 2018) net loss for the reporting period, adjusted for any changes in the noncontrolling interest holders' claim to net assets, including contingent milestone, royalty and option payments. a summary of net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest related to our vies for 2018 and 2017 is as follows:
loss attributable to noncontrolling interest before benefit from income taxes and changes in fair value of contingent payments     $31,191                $223,379
benefit from income taxes                                                                                                           (3,668    )           (114,090    )

net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest                                                                                    $9,793                $171,849
in 2018, the net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest was primarily related to the $29.0 million impairment charge related to vx-210 offset by an increase in the fair value of the contingent payments payable by us to bioaxone of $17.7 million. in 2017, the net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest was primarily related to the $255.3 million impairment charge related to parion's pulmonary enac platform, a decrease in fair value of the contingent payments payable by us to parion of $69.6 million upon deconsolidation and a benefit from income taxes of $126.2 million related to these charges.
income taxes in 2017 and 2018, we were profitable from a u.s. federal income tax perspective and used a portion of our net operating losses to offset this income since becoming profitable. until the fourth quarter of 2018, we maintained a valuation allowance on the majority of our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets. due to this valuation allowance, we did not record a significant provision for income taxes in 2017 and the nine months ended september 30, 2018. in the fourth quarter of 2018, we released the valuation allowance, resulting in a non-cash credit to net income of $1.56 billion. further information on the release of the valuation allowance and significant judgments related to its release can be found below in "critical accounting policies - income taxes."
in 2019, we recorded a provision for income taxes of $218.1 million. starting in 2019, we began recording a provision for income taxes approximating statutory rates on our pre-tax income and continued to utilize our net operating losses to offset income. our effective tax rate for 2019 is lower than the u.s. statutory rate primarily due to excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and research and development tax credits partially offset by a change in our valuation allowance as well as the tax impact of our officers' compensation. due to our ability to offset our pre-tax income against previously benefited net operating losses, we expect the majority of our tax provision to represent a non-cash expense until our net operating losses have been fully utilized.
in 2017, we recorded a benefit from income taxes of $107.3 million, primarily due to a total benefit from income taxes of $114.1 million attributable to noncontrolling interest related to the impairment of parion's pulmonary enac platform and decrease in the fair value of the contingent payments payable by us to parion.

cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities      $3,808,294                $3,168,242                $640,052         20            %
working capital:
total current assets                                  $4,822,829                $3,843,109                $979,720         25            %
total current liabilities                             (1,334,827    )           (1,120,292    )           (214,535     )         (19    )%
total working capital                                 $3,488,002                $2,722,817                $765,185         28            %
as of december 31, 2019, total working capital was $3.5 billion, which represented an increase of $765.2 million from $2.7 billion as of december 31, 2018. the most significant items that increased total working capital in 2019 were $1.6 billion of cash provided by operations and $343.2 million of cash received from issuances of common stock under our employee benefit plans and partially offset by $1.2 billion of cash used to acquire exonics and semma and $192.0 million of cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock.
sources of liquidity as of december 31, 2019, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $3.8 billion, which represented an increase of $640.1 million from $3.2 billion as of december 31, 2018. we intend to rely on our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities together with cash flows from product sales as our primary source of liquidity.
we may borrow up to $500.0 million pursuant to a revolving credit facility that we entered into in 2019. we may repay and reborrow amounts under the revolving credit agreement without penalty. subject to certain conditions, we may request that the borrowing capacity under this credit agreement be increased by an additional $500.0 million, up to a total of $1.0 billion. other possible sources of future liquidity include commercial debt, public and private offerings of our equity and debt securities, strategic sales of assets or businesses and financial transactions. negative covenants in our credit agreement may prohibit or limit our ability to access these sources of liquidity.
future capital requirements we have significant future capital requirements including:
•   significant expected operating expenses to conduct research and development activities and to operate our organization; and
•   substantial facility and capital lease obligations, including leases for two buildings in boston, massachusetts that continue through 2028.
in addition:
•   we have entered into certain collaboration agreements with third parties that include the funding of certain research, development and commercialization efforts with the potential for future milestone and royalty payments by us upon the achievement of pre-established developmental and regulatory targets and/or commercial targets, and we may enter into additional business development transactions, including acquisitions, collaborations and equity investments, that require additional capital.
•   we have reached an agreement with the french government and will repay a portion of the amounts we have collected under the orkambi early access programs in france to the french government in 2020 based on the difference between the invoiced amount and the final amount for orkambi distributed through these programs as reflected in the structure of the agreement with the french government.
•   to the extent we borrow amounts under the credit agreement we entered into in 2019, we would be required to repay any outstanding principal amounts in 2024.
we expect that cash flows from our products together with our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. the adequacy of our available funds to meet our future operating and capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the amounts of future revenues generated by our products, and the potential introduction of one or more of our other drug candidates to the market, the level of our business development activities and the number, breadth, cost and prospects of our research and development programs.
financing strategy we may raise additional capital by borrowing under credit agreements, through public offerings or private placements of our securities or securing new collaborative agreements or other methods of financing. we will continue to manage our capital structure and will consider all financing opportunities, whenever they may occur, that could strengthen our long-term liquidity profile. there can be no assurance that any such financing opportunities will be available on acceptable terms, if at all.
contractual commitments and obligations the following table sets forth our commitments and obligations as of december 31, 2019:
research and development costs                       51,934       565                     18                                    -                     52,517
total contractual commitments and obligations      $150,796              $226,875                $243,528                $793,848                 $1,415,047
leases we lease two buildings that are located at fan pier in boston, massachusetts. we commenced lease payments on these two buildings in december 2013 and the initial lease periods end in december 2028. we also lease office and laboratory space in san diego, california. we commenced lease payments for this building in the second quarter of 2019 pursuant to a 16 year lease. the future minimum rental payments that we are obligated to pay related to the san diego building are included in "finance leases, excluding fan pier leases," which also reflects leases of equipment that are accounted for as finance leases. the remainder of our real estate leases are reflected in "operating leases" in the table above.
research and development costs the amounts reflected in "research and development costs" do not include certain payments we anticipate making to clinical research organizations, or cros, because these contracts are cancelable, at our option, with notice. however, we historically have not cancelled such contracts. as of december 31, 2019, we had accrued $40.2 million related to these contracts for costs incurred for services provided through december 31, 2019, and we have approximately $200.6 million in cancelable future commitments based on existing contracts as of december 31, 2019. these amounts reflect planned expenditures based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to, or terminations of, existing contracts or anticipated or potential new contracts.
collaborative arrangements and asset acquisitions we have entered into certain research and development collaboration agreements with third parties and acquired certain assets that include the funding of certain development, manufacturing and commercialization efforts with the potential for future milestone and royalty payments by us upon the achievement of pre-established developmental, regulatory and/or commercial targets. our obligation to fund these efforts is contingent upon continued involvement in the programs and/or the lack of any adverse events that could cause the discontinuance of the programs. these payments include:
•   research and development milestones: the majority of our in-license agreements and our acquisitions have milestone and royalty payments payable by us upon the successful achievement of pre-established developmental, regulatory and/or commercial targets or net sales. contingent payments under these agreements become due and payable only upon achievement of certain milestones and are not included in the contractual obligations table above.
tax-related obligations we exclude liabilities pertaining to uncertain tax positions from our summary of contractual obligations as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. as of december 31, 2019, our liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions were $33.9 million.
other funding commitments our table detailing contractual commitments and obligations does not include severance payment obligations to certain of our executive officers in the event of a not-for-cause employment termination under existing employment contracts. we will provide information regarding these obligations annually in our proxy statement for our annual meeting of shareholders.
in addition, we began distributing orkambi through early access programs in france in 2015. we received payment from the french government based on the invoiced amount and remained in reimbursement discussions for orkambi in france until november 2019, when we reached an agreement for historical and future shipments of orkambi with the french government. based on the structure of the agreement with the french government, we will pay the difference between the amounts collected based on the invoiced amount and the final amount for orkambi distributed through early access programs to the french government in 2020.
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. these items are monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which the change occurs. we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate.
we believe that our application of the following accounting policies, each of which requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management, are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results:
•   revenue recognition;
•   acquisitions, including intangible assets, goodwill and contingent consideration; and our accounting policies, including the ones discussed below, are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, including note a, "nature of business and accounting policies," included in this annual report on form 10-k.
revenue recognition product revenues, net we generate product revenues from sales in the united states and in international markets. we sell our products principally to a limited number of specialty pharmacy and specialty distributors in the united states, which account for the largest portion of our total revenues, and make international sales primarily to specialty distributors and retail chains, as well as hospitals and clinics, many of which are government-owned or supported customers, collectively, our customers. our customers in the united states subsequently resell our products to patients and health care providers. we contract with government agencies so that our products will be eligible for purchase by, or partial or full reimbursement from, such third-party payors. we recognize net product revenues from sales of our products when our customers obtain control of our products, which typically occurs upon delivery to our customers. revenues from our product sales are recorded at the net sales price, or "transaction price," which requires us to make several significant estimates regarding the net sales price.
the most significant estimate we are required to make is related to government and private payor rebates, chargebacks, discounts and fees, collectively rebates. the value of the rebates provided to third-party payors per course of treatment vary significantly and are based on government-mandated discounts and our arrangements with other third-party payors. in order to estimate our total rebates, we estimate the percentage of prescriptions that will be covered by each third-party payor, which is referred to as the payor mix. we track available information regarding changes, if any, to the payor mix for our products, to our contractual terms with third-party payors and to applicable governmental programs and regulations and levels of our products in the distribution channel. we adjust our estimated rebates based on new information, including information regarding actual rebates for our products, as it becomes available. claims by third-party payors for rebates are submitted to us significantly after the related sales, potentially resulting in adjustments in the period in which the new information becomes known. our credits to revenue related to prior period sales, excluding the adjustment to the transaction price for orkambi distributed through early access programs in france, have not been significant (typically less than 1% of gross product revenues) and primarily related to u.s. rebates.
the following table summarizes activity related to our accruals for rebates (including our refund liability to the french government related to orkambi distributed through early access programs in france as described below) for the three years ended december 31, 2019:
provision related to current year sales                                   176,996
credits/payments made                                                    (137,765      )
provision related to current year sales and the adoption of asc 606       684,299
credits/payments made                                                    (229,361      )
provision related to current year sales                                   655,980
credits/payments made                                                    (469,832      )
we have also entered into annual contracts with government-owned and supported customers in international markets that limit the amount of annual reimbursement we can receive. upon exceeding the annual reimbursement amount, products are provided free of charge, which is a material right. we defer a portion of the consideration received, which includes upfront payments and fees, for shipments made up to the annual reimbursement limit as "other current liabilities." the deferred amount is recognized as revenue when the free products are shipped. in order to estimate the portion of the consideration received to recognize as revenue and the portion of the amount to defer, we rely on our forecast of the number of units we will distribute during the applicable annual period in each international market in which our contracts with government-owned and supported customers limit the amount of annual reimbursement we can receive. our forecasts are based on, among other things, our historical experience.
the preceding estimates and judgments materially affect our recognition of net product revenues. changes in our estimates of net product revenues could have a material effect on net product revenues recorded in the period in which we determine that change occurs.
french early access programs in 2015, we began distributing orkambi through early access programs in france and remained engaged in reimbursement discussions with the french government for orkambi, including orkambi distributed through early access programs, until november 2019, when we reached an agreement with the french government. from the time we began distributing orkambi through early access programs in france, we have expected that the difference between the amounts collected based on the invoiced amount and the final amount for orkambi distributed through these programs would be returned to the french government. our refund liability related to the early access programs in france is classified in "accrued expenses" on our consolidated balance sheets.
pursuant to the revenue recognition accounting guidance that was applicable until december 31, 2017, our orkambi net product revenues for 2015, 2016 and 2017 did not include any net product revenues from sales of orkambi in france. upon adopting asc 606, in the first quarter of 2018, we began recognizing orkambi net product revenues in france based on a transaction price that reflected our estimate of consideration we expected to retain that would not be subject to a significant reversal in amounts recognized, which resulted in revenue representing a portion of the invoiced amount. we recognized orkambi net product revenues from shipments of orkambi in france based on this estimate from the first quarter of 2018 through the third quarter of 2019.
upon reaching an agreement with the french government for orkambi, including the final amount for orkambi distributed through early access programs in france in the fourth quarter of 2019, we updated the transaction price related to orkambi distributed through early access programs and recognized net product revenues of $155.8 million related to these shipments, which occurred from 2015 through the date of our agreement with the french government, because the final amount for these shipments exceeded our previous estimate.
acquisitions we are required to make several significant judgments and estimates in order to calculate the purchase price for our business combinations and then allocate it to the assets that we have acquired and the liabilities that we have assumed on our consolidated balance sheet. the most significant judgments and estimates relate to the fair value of the in-process research and development assets and contingent consideration liabilities related to these business combinations. based on these judgments and estimates, the fair value of the goodwill that we record as a result of these business combinations may be material. once recorded, these assets are subject to quarterly impairment analysis and our contingent consideration liability is adjusted quarterly, which requires similar judgments and estimates.
intangible assets in 2019, we recorded in-process research and development assets related to our acquisitions of exonics and semma totaling $400.0 million on our consolidated balance sheet. each of these assets is accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset and is maintained on our consolidated balance sheet until either the project underlying it is completed or the asset becomes impaired. when we determine that an asset has become impaired or we abandon a project, we write down the carrying value of the related intangible asset to its fair value and record an impairment charge in the period in which the impairment occurs. in 2018 and 2017, we recorded full impairment charges of $29.0 million and $255.3 million for the in-process research and development assets that had previously been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets related to our collaborations with bioaxone and parion, respectively.
to determine the fair value of our in-process research and development assets, we utilize the multi-period excess earnings method of the income approach, which requires us to make estimates of the probability of technical and regulatory success, development cost assumptions, revenue projections and growth rates, commercial cost estimates and appropriate discount rates. these assumptions require significant management judgment and reasonable changes in the assumptions can cause material changes to the fair value of the intangible assets. due to the pre-clinical nature of exonics and semma's programs, these significant assumptions could be affected by future economic and market conditions.
contingent consideration as of december 31, 2019, we recorded $176.5 million of liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet attributable to the fair value of the contingent development and regulatory payments that we may owe to exonics' former equity holders upon the achievement of certain events. our acquisition of semma did not include similar contingent payments; therefore, we are not required to record contingent consideration liabilities related to our acquisition of semma.
we record an increase or a decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability on our consolidated balance sheet and in our consolidated statement of operations on a quarterly basis. we determine the fair value of our contingent consideration liability using a probability weighted discounted cash flow method of the income approach, which requires us to make estimates of the timing of regulatory and commercial milestone achievement and the corresponding estimated probability of technical and regulatory success rates. significant judgment is used in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions during each reporting period. reasonable changes in these assumptions can cause material changes to the fair value of our contingent consideration liability. due to the pre-clinical nature of exonics' dmd and dm1 programs, these significant assumptions could be affected by future economic and market conditions.
goodwill in 2019, we recorded goodwill of $554.6 million and $397.1 million related to our acquisitions of semma and exonics, respectively. goodwill reflects the difference between the fair value of the consideration transferred and the fair value of the net assets acquired. thus, the goodwill that we record is dependent on the significant judgments and estimates inherent in the fair value of our in-process research and development assets and contingent consideration liabilities.
income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. if our estimate of the tax effect of reversing temporary differences is (i) not reflective of actual outcomes, (ii) modified to reflect new developments or interpretations of the tax law, or (iii) revised to incorporate new accounting principles, or changes in the expected timing or manner of the reversal, our results of operations could be materially impacted.
we are engaged in research and development activities and incurred significant net operating losses for a number of years before recently becoming profitable. since we started generating profits, we have used a portion of our net operating losses and maintained a valuation allowance on the majority of our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets until december 31, 2018. accordingly, we did not report any tax benefits relating to our net operating loss carryforwards and income tax credit carryforwards that are available for utilization in future periods. as of december 31, 2018, we released the valuation allowance on the majority of our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets resulting in a non-cash benefit from income taxes of $1.56 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018.
we provide a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. on a periodic basis, we reassess our valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets, weighing positive and negative evidence to assess the recoverability of the deferred tax assets. in the fourth quarter of 2018, we reassessed our valuation allowances and considered positive evidence including significant cumulative consolidated and u.s. income over the three years ended december 31, 2018, revenue growth, clinical program progression, including the advancement and clinical trial data from our triple combination regimens, and expectations regarding future profitability, and negative evidence, including potential impact of competition on our projections and cumulative losses in the jurisdictions. after assessing both the positive evidence and the negative evidence, we released the valuation allowance on the majority of our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets as of december 31, 2018.
significant judgment is required in making these assessments to maintain or reverse our valuation allowances and, to the extent our future expectations change we would have to assess the recoverability of these deferred tax assets at that time. the determination to release the majority of our valuation allowances increased our net income by $1.56 billion, or $6.03 per share in 2018. in 2019, we recorded a significant provision for income tax, which was the result of utilizing previously benefitted deferred tax assets.
recent accounting pronouncements refer to note a, "nature of business and accounting policies," in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and new accounting pronouncements adopted during 2019.

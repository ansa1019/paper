item 1a.   risk factors in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10-k ("2019 form 10-k"), the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating us and our business because such factors may significantly impact our business, operating results, and financial condition. as a result of these risk factors, as well as other risks discussed in our other sec filings, our actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. no priority or significance is intended by, nor should be attached to, the order in which the risk factors appear.
the semiconductor capital equipment industry is subject to variability and periods of rapid growth or decline; we therefore face risks related to our strategic resource allocation decisions the semiconductor capital equipment industry has historically been characterized by rapid changes in demand. the industry environment has moved toward being more characterized by variability across segments and customers, accentuated by consolidation within the industry. variability in our customers' business plans may lead to changes in demand for our equipment and services, which could negatively impact our results. the variability in our customers' investments during any particular period is dependent on several factors, including but not limited to electronics demand, economic conditions (both general and in the semiconductor and electronics industries), industry supply and demand, prices for semiconductors, and our customers' ability to develop and manufacture increasingly complex and costly semiconductor devices. the changes in demand may require our management to adjust spending and other resources allocated to operating activities.
during periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services, we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems, and procedures for training, assimilating, and managing our workforce, and in appropriately sizing our supply chain infrastructure and facilities, work force, and other components of our business on a timely basis. if we do not adequately meet these challenges during periods of increasing or declining demand, our gross margins and earnings may be negatively impacted.
we continuously reassess our strategic resource allocation choices in response to the changing business environment. if we do not adequately adapt to the changing business environment, we may lack the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during a period of growth, or we may expand our capacity too rapidly and/or beyond what is appropriate for the actual demand environment, resulting in excess fixed costs.
especially during transitional periods, resource allocation decisions can have a significant impact on our future performance, particularly if we have not accurately anticipated industry changes. our success will depend, to a continues on next page lam research corporation 2019 10-k significant extent, on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively.
future declines in the semiconductor industry, and the overall world economic conditions on which it is significantly dependent, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers, which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits. with the consolidation of customers within the industry, the semiconductor capital equipment market may experience rapid changes in demand driven both by changes in the market generally and the plans and requirements of particular customers. the economic, political, and business conditions occurring nationally, globally, or in any of our key sales regions, which are often unpredictable, have historically impacted customer demand for our products and normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers, and creditors. additionally, in times of economic uncertainty, our customers' budgets for our products, or their ability to access credit to purchase them, could be adversely affected. this would limit their ability to purchase our products and services. as a result, changing economic, political or business conditions can cause material adverse changes to our results of operations and financial condition, including but not limited to:
•   an increase in reserves on accounts receivable due to our customers' inability to pay us;
•   an increase in reserves on inventory balances due to excess or obsolete inventory as a result of our inability to sell such inventory;
•   exposure to claims from our suppliers for payment on inventory that is ordered in anticipation of customer purchases that do not come to fruition;
•   a decline in the value of certain facilities we lease to less than our residual value guarantee with the lessor; and fluctuating levels of investment by semiconductor manufacturers may materially affect our aggregate shipments, revenues, operating results, and earnings. where appropriate, we will attempt to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams, which sometimes result in restructuring charges. even during periods of reduced revenues, we must continue to invest in r&d and maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive, which may temporarily harm our profitability and other financial results.
our revenues and operating results are variable our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year due to a number of factors, not all of which are in our control. we manage our expense levels based in part on our expectations of future revenues. because our operating expenses are based in part on anticipated future revenues, and a certain amount of those expenses are relatively fixed, a change in the timing of recognition of revenue and/or the level of gross profit from a small number of transactions can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter or year. factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include but are not limited to:
•   economic conditions in the electronics and semiconductor industries in general and specifically the semiconductor equipment industry;
•   the failure of our suppliers or outsource providers to perform their obligations in a manner consistent with our expectations;
•   our ability to develop, introduce, and market new, enhanced, and competitive products in a timely manner;
•   our competitors' introduction of new products;
•   transportation, communication, demand, information technology, or supply disruptions based on factors outside our control, such as strikes, acts of god, wars, terrorist activities, and natural or man-made disasters;
•   legal, tax, accounting, or regulatory changes (including but not limited to change in import/export regulations and tariffs) or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing requirements;
we may incur impairments to goodwill or long-lived assets we review our long-lived assets, including goodwill and intangible assets identified in business combinations and other intangible assets, for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. negative industry or economic trends, including reduced market prices of our common stock, reduced estimates of future cash flows, disruptions to our business, slower growth rates, or lack of growth in our relevant business units, could lead to impairment charges against our long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets. if, in any period, our stock price decreases to the point where our fair value, as determined by our market capitalization, is less than the book value of our assets, this could also indicate a potential impairment, and we may be required to record an impairment charge in that period, which could adversely affect our result of operations.
our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance. we operate in a highly competitive environment and projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results. additionally, if our analysis indicates potential impairment to goodwill in one or more of our business units, we may be required to record additional charges to earnings in our financial statements, which could negatively affect our results of operations.
our leverage and debt service obligations and potential note conversion or related hedging activities may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and earnings per share we have $4.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, convertible notes, and commercial paper instruments outstanding. additionally, we have funding available to us under our $1.25 billion commercial paper program and our $1.25 billion revolving credit facility, which serves as a backstop to our commercial paper program. our revolving credit facility also includes an option to increase the amount up to an additional $600 million, for a potential total commitment of $1.85 billion. we may, in the future, decide to enter into additional debt arrangements.
in addition, we have entered, and in the future may enter, into derivative instrument arrangements to hedge against the variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate of fixed rate debt. we could be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our derivative instruments.
•   risk associated with any inability to satisfy our obligations;
•   a portion of our cash flows that may have to be dedicated to interest and principal payments and may not be available for operations, working capital, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions, or general corporate or other purposes; and
•   impairing our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.
continues on next page lam research corporation 2019 10-k our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory, and other factors. furthermore, our operations may not generate sufficient cash flows, to enable us to meet our expenses and service our debt. as a result, we may need to enter into new financing arrangements to obtain the necessary funds. if we determine it is necessary to seek additional funding for any reason, we may not be able to obtain such funding or, if funding is available, obtain it on acceptable terms. if we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt, and this default could cause us to be in default on our other outstanding indebtedness.
conversion of our convertible notes may cause dilution to our stockholders and to our earnings per share. the number of shares of our common stock into which the convertible notes are convertible may be adjusted from time to time, including increases in such rates as a result of dividends that we pay to our stockholders. upon conversion of any convertible notes, we will deliver cash in the amount of the principal amount of the convertible notes and, with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the convertible notes, shares of our common stock, which would result in dilution to our stockholders. prior to the maturity of the convertible notes, if the price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price, u.s. generally accepted accounting principles require that we report an increase in diluted share count, which would result in lower reported earnings per share. the price of our common stock could also be affected by sales of our common stock by investors who view the convertible notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in our company and also by hedging activity that may develop involving our common stock by holders of the convertible notes.
our credit agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business we may be unable to respond to changes in business and economic conditions, engage in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us, or obtain additional financing because our debt agreements contain, and any of our other future similar agreements may contain, covenant restrictions that limit our ability to, among other things:
•   incur additional debt, assume obligations in connection with letters of credit, or issue guarantees;
•   enter into transactions with our affiliates;
•   merge or consolidate with any person.
our ability to comply with these covenants is dependent on our future performance, which will be subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including prevailing economic conditions. in addition, our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the senior notes, the convertible notes, or our other debt, which could permit the holders to accelerate such debt. if any of our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt, which could materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operation.
we have a limited number of key customers sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue, shipments, cash flows, collections, and profitability. as a result, the actions of even one customer may subject us to variability in those areas that is difficult to predict. in addition, large customers may be able to negotiate requirements that result in decreased pricing, increased costs, and/or lower margins for us; compliance with specific environmental, social, and corporate governance standards; and limitations on our ability to share technology with others. similarly, significant portions of our credit risk may, at any given time, be concentrated among a limited number of customers so that the failure of even one of these key customers to pay its obligations to us could significantly impact our financial results.
continues on next page lam research corporation 2019 10-k we depend on creating new products and processes and enhancing existing products and processes for our success; consequently, we are subject to risks associated with rapid technological change rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances that enable those processes. we believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products. if new products or existing products have reliability, quality, design, or safety problems, our performance may be impacted by reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance of and payment for new products, and additional service and warranty expenses. we may be unable to develop and manufacture products successfully, or products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace. for more than 25 years, the primary driver of technology advancement in the semiconductor industry has been to shrink the lithography that prints the circuit design on semiconductor chips. that driver could be approaching its technological limit, leading semiconductor manufacturers to investigate more complex changes in multiple technologies in an effort to continue technology development. in the face of uncertainty on which technology solutions will become successful, we will need to focus our efforts on developing the technology changes that are ultimately successful in supporting our customer requirements. our failure to develop and offer the correct technology solutions in a timely manner with productive and cost-effective products could adversely affect our business in a material way. our failure to commercialize new products in a timely manner could result in loss of market share, unanticipated costs, and inventory obsolescence, which would adversely affect our financial results.
in order to develop new products and processes and enhance existing products and processes, we expect to continue to make significant investments in r&d, to investigate the acquisition of new products and technologies, to invest in or acquire such business or technologies, and to pursue joint development relationships with customers, suppliers, or other members of the industry. our investments and acquisitions may not be as successful as we may expect, particularly as we seek to invest or acquire product lines and technologies that are new to us. we may find that acquisitions are not available to us, for regulatory or other reasons, and that we must therefore limit ourselves to collaboration and joint venture development activities, which do not have the same benefits as acquisitions. pursuing development through collaboration and/or joint development activities rather than through an acquisition poses substantial challenges for management, including those related to aligning business objectives; sharing confidential information, intellectual property and data; sharing value with third parties; and realizing synergies that might have been available in an acquisition but are not available through a joint development project. we must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully, as the introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products and certain jointly developed technologies may be subject to restrictions on our ability to share that technology with other customers, which could limit our market for products incorporating those technologies. future technologies, processes, or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete, leaving us with non-competitive products, obsolete inventory, or both. moreover, customers may adopt new technologies or processes to address the complex challenges associated with next-generation devices. this shift may result in a reduction in the size of our addressable markets or could increase the relative size of markets in which we either do not compete or have relatively low market share.
we are subject to risks relating to product concentration and lack of product revenue diversification we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products. our products are priced up to approximately $11 million per system. as a result, the inability to recognize revenue on even a few systems can cause a significantly adverse impact on our revenues for a given quarter, and, in the longer term, the continued market acceptance of these products is critical to our future success. our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by:
•   a decline in demand for even a limited number of our products,
•   export restrictions or other regulatory or legislative actions that could limit our ability to sell those products to key customers or customers within certain markets,
•   an improved version of products being offered by a competitor in the markets in which we participate,
•   increased pressure from competitors that offer broader product lines,
•   increased pressure from regional competitors,
•   technological changes that we are unable to address with our products, or continues on next page lam research corporation 2019 10-k in addition, the fact that we offer limited product lines creates the risk that our customers may view us as less important to their business than our competitors that offer additional products and/or product capabilities. this may impact our ability to maintain or expand our business with certain customers. such product concentration may also subject us to additional risks associated with technology changes. our business is affected by our customers' use of our products in certain steps in their wafer fabrication processes. should technologies change so that the manufacture of semiconductors requires fewer steps using our products, this could have a larger impact on our business than it would on the business of our less concentrated competitors.
strategic alliances and customer consolidation may have negative effects on our business increasingly, semiconductor manufacturing companies are entering into strategic alliances or consolidating with one another to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies and/or achieve economies of scale. the outcomes of such an alliance can be the definition of a particular tool set for a certain function and/or the standardization of a series of process steps that use a specific set of manufacturing equipment, while the outcomes of consolidation can lead to an overall reduction in the market for semiconductor manufacturing equipment as customers' operations achieve economies of scale and/or increased purchasing power based on their higher volumes. in certain instances, this could work to our disadvantage if a competitor's tools or equipment become the standard equipment for such functions or processes. additional outcomes of such consolidation may include our customers re-evaluating their future supplier relationships to consider our competitors' products and/or gaining additional influence over the pricing of products and the control of intellectual property or data.
similarly, our customers may partner with, or follow the lead of, educational or research institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps. if those institutions utilize a competitor's equipment when they establish those processes, it is likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing lines. even if they select our equipment, the institutions and the customers that follow their lead could impose conditions on acceptance of that equipment, such as adherence to standards and requirements or limitations on how we license our proprietary rights, that increase our costs or require us to take on greater risk. these actions could adversely impact our market share and financial results.
we depend on a limited number of key suppliers and outsource providers, and we run the risk that they might not perform as we expect outsource providers and component suppliers have played and will continue to play a key role in our product development, manufacturing operations, field installation and support, and many of our transactional and administrative functions, such as information technology, facilities management, and certain elements of our finance organization. these providers and suppliers might suffer financial setbacks, be acquired by third parties, become subject to exclusivity arrangements that preclude further business with us, or be unable to meet our requirements or expectation due to their independent business decisions or force majeure events that could interrupt or impair their continued ability to perform as we expect.
although we attempt to select reputable providers and suppliers and we attempt to secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts, it is possible that one or more of these providers or suppliers could fail to perform as we expect, or fail to secure or protect intellectual property rights, and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business. in some cases, the requirements of our business mandate that we obtain certain components and sub-assemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. where practical, we endeavor to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any single provider or supplier will adversely affect our business, but this is not feasible in all circumstances. there is therefore a risk that a prolonged inability to obtain certain components or secure key services could impair our ability to manage operations, ship products, and generate revenues, which could adversely affect our operating results and damage our customer relationships.
continues on next page lam research corporation 2019 10-k we face risks related to the disruption of our primary manufacturing facilities while we maintain business continuity plans, our manufacturing facilities are concentrated in a limited number of locations. these locations are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, such as natural or man-made disasters, terrorist activities, disruptions of our information technology resources, utility interruptions, or other events beyond our control. such disruptions may cause delays in shipping our products, which could result in the loss of business or customer trust, adversely affecting our business and operating results.
once a semiconductor manufacturer commits to purchase a competitor's semiconductor manufacturing equipment, the manufacturer typically continues to purchase that competitor's equipment, making it more difficult for us to sell our equipment to that customer semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line. we believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier's processing equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time, especially for customers that are more focused on tool reuse. accordingly, we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer for a product line application if that customer initially selects a competitor's equipment for the same product line application.
we face a challenging and complex competitive environment we face significant competition from multiple competitors, and with increased consolidation efforts in our industry, as well as the emergence and strengthening of new, regional competitors, we may face increasing competitive pressures. other companies continue to develop systems and/or acquire businesses and products that are competitive to ours and may introduce new products and product capabilities that may affect our ability to sell and support our existing products. we face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop, as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers.
we believe that to remain competitive we must devote significant financial resources to offer products that meet our customers' needs, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to invest in product and process r&d. certain of our competitors, including those that are created and financially backed by foreign governments, have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to offer customers a more comprehensive array of products and/or product capabilities and to therefore achieve additional relative success in the semiconductor equipment industry. these competitors may deeply discount or give away products similar to those that we sell, challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar accommodations and threatening our ability to sell those products. we also face competition from our own customers, who in some instances have established affiliated entities that manufacture equipment similar to ours. in addition, we face competition from companies that exist in a more favorable legal or regulatory environment than we do, allowing the freedom of action in ways that we may be unable to match. in many cases speed to solution is necessary for customer satisfaction and our competitors may be better positioned to achieve these objectives. for these reasons, we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide.
in addition, our competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. in particular, while we continue to develop product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements, we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully, or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive. accordingly, competition may intensify, and we may be unable to continue to compete successfully in our markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.
our future success depends heavily on international sales and the management of global operations non-u.s. sales, as reflected in part ii item 7. results of operation of this 2019 form 10-k, accounted for approximately 92%, 93%, and 92% of total revenue in fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. we expect that international sales will continue to account for a substantial majority of our total revenue in future years.
continues on next page lam research corporation 2019 10-k we are subject to various challenges related to international sales and the management of global operations including, but not limited to:
•   developing customers and/or suppliers, who may have limited access to capital resources.
•   global or national economic and political conditions;
•   our ability to respond to customer and foreign government demands for locally sourced systems, spare parts, and services and develop the necessary relationships with local suppliers;
•   compliance with u.s. and international laws and regulations affecting foreign operations, including u.s. and international trade restrictions and sanctions, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, environmental, tax, and labor laws;
•   our ability to secure and retain qualified people, and effectively manage people, in all necessary locations for the successful operation of our business.
there is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships among china, japan, korea, taiwan, and the united states, that political, diplomatic and national security influences might lead to trade disputes, impacts and/or disruptions, in particular those affecting the semiconductor industry. this would adversely affect our business with china, japan, korea, and/or taiwan and perhaps the entire asia pacific region or global economy. a significant trade dispute, impact and/or disruption in any area where we do business could have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits. tariffs, export controls, additional taxes, trade barriers or sanctions may increase our manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial conditions. in addition, there are risks that foreign governments may, among other things, insist on the use of local suppliers; compel companies to partner with local companies to design and supply equipment on a local basis, requiring the transfer of intellectual property rights and/or local manufacturing; utilize their influence over their judicial systems to respond to intellectual property disputes or issues; and provide special incentives to government-backed local customers to buy from local competitors, even if their products are inferior to ours; all of which could adversely impact our revenues and margins. certain international sales depend on our ability to obtain export licenses from the u.s. or foreign governments. our failure or inability to obtain such licenses, or an expansion of the number or kinds of sales for which export licenses are required, could potentially limit our markets and impact our revenues. many of the challenges noted above are applicable in china, which is a fast-developing market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore an area of anticipated growth for our business.
we are exposed to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. the majority of our sales and expenses are denominated in u.s. dollars. however, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily related to revenues denominated in japanese yen and expenses denominated in euro and korean won. currently, we hedge certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows, primarily anticipated revenues denominated in japanese yen and expenses dominated in euro and korean won. in addition, we enter into foreign currency hedge contracts to minimize the short-term impact of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily third-party accounts receivables, accounts payables, and intercompany receivables and payables. we believe these are our primary exposures to currency rate fluctuation. we expect to continue to enter into hedging transactions, for the purposes outlined, for the foreseeable future. however, these hedging transactions may not achieve their desired effect because differences between the actual timing of the underlying exposures and our forecasts of those exposures may leave us either over or under hedged on any given transaction. moreover, by hedging these foreign currency denominated revenues, expenses, monetary assets, and liabilities, we may miss favorable currency trends that would have been advantageous to us but for the hedges. additionally, we are exposed to short-term foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on non-u.s. dollar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities (other than those currency exposures previously discussed), and currently we do not enter into foreign currency hedge contracts against these exposures. therefore, we are subject to potential unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that we transact business (including intercompany transactions) in these currencies.
continues on next page lam research corporation 2019 10-k the magnitude of our overseas business also affects where our cash is generated. certain uses of cash, such as share repurchases, payment of dividends, or the repayment of our notes, can usually only be made with onshore cash balances. since the majority of our cash is generated outside of the united states, this may impact certain business decisions and outcomes.
our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key employees is critical to our success our ability to compete successfully depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key employees with the appropriate skills, experiences and competencies. this is an ongoing challenge due to intense competition for top talent, fluctuations in industry or business economic conditions, as well as increasing geographic expansion, and these factors in combination may result in cycles of hiring activity and workforce reductions. our success in hiring depends on a variety of factors, including the attractiveness of our compensation and benefit programs, global economic or political and industry conditions, our organizational structure, global competition for talent and the availability of qualified employees, the availability of career development opportunities, the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries, and our ability to offer a challenging and rewarding work environment. we periodically evaluate our overall compensation and benefit programs and make adjustments, as appropriate, to maintain or enhance their competitiveness. if we are not able to successfully attract, retain, and motivate key employees, we may be unable to capitalize on market opportunities and our operating results may be materially and adversely affected.
certain critical information systems, that we rely on for the operation of our business and products that we sell, are susceptible to cybersecurity and other threats or incidents we maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business. these information systems include but are not limited to, telecommunications, the internet, our corporate intranet, various computer hardware and software applications, (some of which may be integrated into the products that we sell or be required in order to provide the services that we offer), network communications, and email. these information systems may be owned and maintained by us, our outsourced providers, or third parties such as vendors, contractors, customers and cloud providers. in addition, we make use of software-as-a-service (saas) products for certain important business functions that are provided by third parties and hosted on their own networks and servers, or third-party networks and servers, all of which rely on networks, email and/or the internet for their function. all of these information systems are subject to disruption, breach or failure from various sources, including those using techniques that change frequently or may be disguised or difficult to detect, or designed to remain dormant until a triggering event, or that may continue undetected for an extended period of time. those sources may include mistakes or unauthorized actions by our employees or contractors, phishing schemes and other third-party attacks, and degradation or loss of service or access to data due to viruses, malware, denial of service attacks, destructive or inadequate code, power failures, or physical damage to computers, hard drives, communication lines, or networking equipment.
we have experienced cyber threats and incidents in the past. although past threats and incidents have not resulted in a material adverse effect, we may incur material losses related to cyber threats or incidents in the future. if we were subject to a cyber incident, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. such adverse effects might include:
•   loss of (or inability to access, e.g. through ransomware) confidential and/or sensitive information stored on these critical information systems or transmitted to or from those systems;
•   misappropriation or theft of our or a customer, supplier or other party's assets or resources, and costs associated therewith;
continues on next page lam research corporation 2019 10-k while we have implemented iso 27001 compliant security procedures and virus protection software, intrusion prevention systems, identity and access control, and emergency recovery processes, and we carefully select our third-party providers of information systems, to mitigate risks to the information systems that we rely on, those mitigation and protection systems cannot be guaranteed to be fail-safe and we may still suffer cyber-related incidents.
our financial results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities we are subject to income, transaction, and other taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions, and significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax liabilities. the amount of taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability. as a global company, our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region. our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates, in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets, in tax laws, by material audit assessments, or by changes in or expirations of agreements with tax authorities. these factors could affect our profitability. in particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the united states, is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states.
a failure to comply with environmental regulations may adversely affect our operating results we are subject to a variety of domestic and international governmental regulations related to the handling, discharge, and disposal of toxic, volatile, or otherwise hazardous chemicals. failure to comply with present or future environmental regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, require us to undertake remediation activities, suspend production, and/or cease operations, or cause our customers to not accept our products. these regulations could require us to alter our current operations, acquire significant additional equipment, incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations, or take other actions. any failure to comply with regulations governing the use, handling, sale, transport, or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities that may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, and ability to operate our business.
if we choose to acquire or dispose of businesses, product lines, and technologies, we may encounter unforeseen costs and difficulties that could impair our financial performance an important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products, augment our market coverage and distribution ability, enhance our technological capabilities, or accomplish other strategic objectives. as a result, we may seek to make acquisitions of complementary companies, products, or technologies, or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies that no longer fit our long-term strategies. for regulatory or other reasons, we may not be successful in our attempts to acquire or dispose of businesses, products, or technologies, resulting in significant financial costs, reduced or lost opportunities, and diversion of management's attention. managing an acquired business, disposing of product technologies, or reducing personnel entails numerous operational and financial risks, including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups, diversion of management's attention away from other business concerns, amortization of acquired intangible assets, adverse customer reaction to our decision to cease support for a product, and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations. there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions, disposition of product lines or technologies, or reduction in personnel, or that our management, personnel, or systems will be adequate to support continued operations. any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.
in addition, any acquisition could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, the amortization of related intangible assets, and goodwill impairment charges, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or the price of our common stock.
continues on next page lam research corporation 2019 10-k the market for our common stock is volatile, which may affect our ability to raise capital or make acquisitions or may subject our business to additional costs the market price for our common stock is volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years. the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors, many of which are not within our control or influence. these factors include but are not limited to the following:
•   general market, semiconductor, or semiconductor equipment industry conditions;
•   economic or political events, trends, and unexpected developments occurring nationally, globally, or in any of our key sales regions;
•   variations in our quarterly operating results and financial condition, including our liquidity;
•   variations in our revenues, earnings, or other business and financial metrics from forecasts by us or securities analysts or from those experienced by other companies in our industry;
•   technological innovations and the introduction of new products by us or our competitors;
•   disruptions of relationships with key customers or suppliers; or in addition, the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations. historically, we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our common stock due in part to the price of and markets for semiconductors. these and other factors have adversely affected and may again adversely affect the price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. in the past, following volatile periods in the price of their stock, many companies became the object of securities class action litigation. if we are sued in a securities class action, we could incur substantial costs, and it could divert management's attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on our financial performance and the price for our common stock.
intellectual property, indemnity, and other claims against us can be costly and we could lose significant rights that are necessary to our continued business and profitability third parties may assert infringement, misappropriation, unfair competition, product liability, breach of contract, or other claims against us. from time to time, other persons send us notices alleging that our products infringe or misappropriate their patent or other intellectual property rights. in addition, law enforcement authorities may seek criminal charges relating to intellectual property or other issues. we also face risks of claims arising from commercial and other relationships. in addition, our bylaws and other indemnity obligations provide that we will indemnify officers and members of our board of directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to us. from time to time, in the normal course of business, we indemnify third parties with whom we enter into contractual relationships, including customers and suppliers, with respect to certain matters. we have agreed, under certain conditions, to hold these third parties harmless against specified losses, such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants, other third-party claims that our products when used for their intended purposes infringe the intellectual property rights of such other third parties, or other claims made against certain parties. in such cases, it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms. however, we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially and adversely affect our business and financial results, and we may be subject to substantial damage awards and penalties. moreover, although we have insurance to protect us from certain claims and cover certain losses to our property, such insurance may not cover us for the full amount of any losses, or at all, and may be subject to substantial exclusions and deductibles.
we may fail to protect our critical proprietary technology rights, which could affect our business our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and our ability to protect key components of that technology through patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other forms of protection. protecting our key proprietary technology helps us achieve our goals of developing technological expertise and new products and continues on next page lam research corporation 2019 10-k systems that give us a competitive advantage; increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base; and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers. as part of our strategy to protect our technology, we currently hold a number of u.s. and foreign patents and pending patent applications, and we keep certain information, processes, and techniques confidential and/or as trade secrets. however, other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the u.s. or foreign governments issue to us; these governments may fail to issue patents for pending applications; or we may lose trade secret protection over valuable information due to our or third parties' intentional or unintentional actions or omissions or even those of our own employees. additionally, intellectual property litigation can be expensive and time-consuming and even when patents are issued, or trade secret processes are followed, the legal systems in certain of the countries in which we do business might not enforce patents and other intellectual property rights as rigorously or effectively as the united states or may favor local entities in their intellectual property enforcement. the rights granted or anticipated under any of our patents, pending patent applications, or trade secrets may be narrower than we expect or, in fact, provide no competitive advantages. moreover, because we selectively file for patent protection in different jurisdictions, we may not have adequate protection in all jurisdictions based on such filing decisions. any of these circumstances could have a material adverse impact on our business.
we are exposed to various risks from our regulatory environment we are subject to various risks related to (1) new, different, inconsistent, or even conflicting laws, rules, and regulations that may be enacted by legislative or executive bodies and/or regulatory agencies in the countries that we operate; (2) disagreements or disputes related to international trade; and (3) the interpretation and application of laws, rules, and regulations. as a public company with global operations, we are subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, including those related to export controls, financial and other disclosures, corporate governance, privacy, anti-corruption, such as the foreign corrupt practices act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, conflict minerals or other social responsibility legislation, immigration or travel regulations, and antitrust regulations, among others. each of these laws, rules, and regulations imposes costs on our business, including financial costs and potential diversion of our management's attention associated with compliance, and may present risks to our business, including potential fines, restrictions on our actions, and reputational damage if we are unable to fully comply.
to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, we intend to invest appropriate resources to comply with evolving standards. changes in or ambiguous interpretations of laws, regulations, and standards may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters. efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased selling, general, and administrative expenses and a diversion of management's time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. if we are found by a court or regulatory agency not to be in compliance with the laws and regulations, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be adversely affected.
there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase our shares at all or in any particular amounts our board of directors has declared quarterly dividends since april 2014. our intent to continue to pay quarterly dividends and to repurchase our shares is subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends and share repurchases are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends or the repurchasing of shares by us. future dividends and share repurchases may also be affected by, among other factors, our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions and the funding of our research and development; legal risks; changes in federal, state, and international tax laws or corporate laws; contractual restrictions, such as financial or operating covenants in our debt arrangements; availability of onshore cash flow; and changes to our business model. our dividend payments and share repurchases may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or repurchase shares at all or in any particular amounts. a reduction or suspension in our dividend payments or share repurchases could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties, and changes in condition, significance, value, and effect. our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those discussed in "risk factors" and elsewhere in this 2019 form 10-k and other documents we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission. (see "cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements" in part i of this 2019 form 10-k.)

executive summary lam research corporation is a global supplier of innovative wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry. we have built a strong global presence with core competencies in areas like nanoscale applications enablement, chemistry, plasma and fluidics, advanced systems engineering and a broad range of operational disciplines. our products and services are designed to help our customers build smaller, faster, and better performing devices that are used in a variety of electronic products, including mobile phones, personal computers, servers, wearables, automotive vehicles, and data storage devices.
our customer base includes leading semiconductor memory, foundry, and integrated device manufacturers that make products such as nvm, dram, and logic devices. we aim to increase our strategic relevance with our customers by contributing more to their continued success. our core technical competency is integrating hardware, process, materials, software, and process control enabling results on the wafer.
semiconductor manufacturing, our customers' business, involves the complete fabrication of multiple dies or integrated circuits on a wafer. this involves the repetition of a set of core processes and can require hundreds of individual steps. fabricating these devices requires highly sophisticated process technologies to integrate an increasing array of new materials with precise control at the atomic scale. along with meeting technical requirements, wafer processing equipment must deliver high productivity and be cost-effective.
demand from the cloud, iot, and other markets is driving the need for increasingly powerful and cost-efficient semiconductors. at the same time, there are growing technical challenges with traditional scaling. these trends are driving significant inflections in semiconductor manufacturing, such as the increasing importance of vertical 3d scaling strategies as well as multiple patterning to enable shrinks.
we believe we are in a strong position with our leadership and competency in deposition, etch, and clean to facilitate some of the most significant innovations in semiconductor device manufacturing. several factors create opportunity for sustainable differentiation for us: (i) our focus on research and development, with several on-going programs relating to sustaining engineering, product and process development, and concept and feasibility; (ii) our ability to effectively leverage cycles of learning from our broad installed base; (iii) our collaborative focus with ecosystem partners; and (iv) our focus on delivering our multi-product solutions with a goal to enhance the value of lam's solutions to our customers.
despite recent semiconductor capital investment volatility, over the longer term, we believe that technology inflections in our industry, including 3d device scaling, multiple patterning, process flow, and advanced packaging chip integration, will lead to an increase in our served addressable market for our products and services in deposition, etch, and clean. while there could be continued variability in the near-term, we believe that demand for our products and services will increase faster than overall spending on wafer fabrication equipment, as the proportion of customers' capital expenditures rises in these technology inflection areas, and as we gain market share.
fiscal year 2018 revenue increased 38% compared to fiscal year 2017, reflecting an increase in technology and capacity investments by our customers. gross margin as a percentage of revenue improved primarily due to favorable margin mix and higher revenue. operating expenses in fiscal year 2018 increased as compared to fiscal year 2017 primarily as a result of higher employee headcount and increased investment in research and development.
our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and restricted cash and investments balances totaled approximately $5.7 billion as of june 30, 2019, compared to $5.2 billion as of june 24, 2018. cash flow provided from operating activities was $3.2 billion for fiscal year 2019 compared to $2.7 billion for fiscal year 2018. cash flow provided from operating activities in fiscal year 2019 was primarily used for $3.8 billion in treasury stock purchases, $678 million in dividends paid to our stockholders, and $303 million of capital expenditures. these cash outflows were partially offset by $2.0 billion of net proceeds from issuance of debt and $85 million of treasury stock reissuance and common stock issuance resulting from our employee equity-based compensation programs.
united states                   8   %                    %                    %
revenue decreased in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018, but increased compared to fiscal year 2017, primarily as a result of the volatility of semiconductor capital investments by our customers. the overall asia region continued to account for a majority of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity investments for semiconductor manufacturing continued to occur in this region.
our deferred revenue balance was $449 million as of june 30, 2019, compared to $994 million as of june 24, 2018. the deferred revenue at the end of june 2019 is recognized under accounting standard codification ("asc") 606, while the same values as of june 2018 are recognized under asc 605, which contributes to the change in value period over period. our deferred revenue balance does not include shipments to customers in japan, to whom title does not transfer until customer acceptance. shipments to customers in japan are classified as inventory at cost until the time of customer acceptance. the anticipated future revenue value from shipments to customers in japan was approximately $78 million as of june 30, 2019, compared to $607 million as of june 24, 2018.
we continued to make significant r&d investments focused on leading-edge deposition, etch, clean, and other semiconductor manufacturing processes. r&d expense during fiscal year 2019 increased slightly compared to fiscal year 2018.
the increase in r&d expense during fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to an $88 million increase in employee compensation and benefits related to increased headcount, a $24 million increase in supplies, and a $23 million increase in outside services and miscellaneous expenses.
the increase in sg&a expense during fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to a $44 million increase in employee compensation and benefits from increased headcount, a $28 million increase in outside services, and a $15 million increase in rent, utilities and repairs.
the loss on impairment of investments during fiscal year 2018 is the result of a decision to sell selected investments held in foreign jurisdictions in connection with our cash repatriation strategy following the december 2017 u.s. tax reform.
loss on extinguishment of debt during fiscal year 2017 related to the special mandatory redemption of certain senior notes issued, as well as the termination of the amended and restated term loan agreement following the termination of the agreement and plan of merger and reorganization with kla-tencor.
income tax expense as discussed in note 7, "income taxes," to our consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this 2019 form 10-k, the "tax cuts & jobs act" (hereafter referred to as "u.s. tax reform") was signed into law on december 22, 2017 and was effective starting in our quarter ended december 24, 2017. u.s. tax reform reduced the u.s. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%, assessed a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. the impact on income taxes due to a change in legislation is required under the authoritative guidance of accounting standards codification ("asc") 740, income taxes, to be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted. in conjunction, the sec issued staff accounting bulletin ("sab") 118, which allowed for the recording of provisional amounts related to u.s. tax reform and subsequent adjustments related to u.s. tax reform during an up to one-year measurement period that is similar to the measurement period used when accounting for business combinations. we recorded what we believed to be reasonable estimates during the sab 118 measurement period. during the december 2018 quarter, we finalized the accounting of the income tax effects of u.s. tax reform. although the sab 118 measurement period has ended, there may be some aspects of u.s. tax reform that remain subject to future regulations and/or notices which may further clarify certain provisions of u.s.
continues on next page lam research corporation 2019 10-k tax reform. we may need to adjust our previously recorded amounts to reflect the recognition and measurement of our tax accounting positions in accordance with asc 740; such adjustments could be material.
the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to the impact of u.s. tax reform and its mandated one-time transition tax on accumulated unrepatriated foreign earnings in fiscal year 2018.
the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to the impact of u.s. tax reform and its mandated one-time transition tax on accumulated unrepatriated foreign earnings.
in july 2015, the u.s. tax court issued an opinion favorable to altera corporation ("altera") with respect to altera's litigation with the internal revenue service ("irs"). the litigation related to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement with altera's foreign subsidiary. in its opinion, the u.s. tax court accepted altera's position of excluding stock-based compensation from its intercompany cost-sharing arrangement. in june 2019, the u.s. court of appeals for the ninth circuit ("ninth circuit"), through a three-judge panel, reversed the 2015 decision of the u.s. tax court. altera has petitioned the ninth circuit for an en banc rehearing of a larger panel of eleven ninth circuit judges. we will continue to monitor and evaluate the potential impact of this litigation on our fiscal year 2020 consolidated financial statements. the estimated potential impact is in the range of $75 million, which may result in a decrease in deferred tax assets and an increase in tax expense.
international revenues account for a significant portion of our total revenues, such that a material portion of our pre-tax income is earned and taxed outside the united states. due to the global intangible low-taxed income ("gilti") provision described in note 7 - income taxes, international pre-tax income is taxable in the united states at a lower effective tax rate than the federal statutory tax rate. please refer to note 7 of our consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this 2019 form 10-k.
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. our gross deferred tax assets were $471 million and $437 million at the end of fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. these gross deferred tax assets were offset by gross deferred tax liabilities of $160 million and $169 million at the end of fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively, and a valuation allowance of $227 million and $200 million at the end of fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. the increase in the gross deferred tax assets and valuation allowance between fiscal year 2019 and 2018 is primarily due to increases in tax carryforwards.
continues on next page lam research corporation 2019 10-k uncertain tax positions we re-evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. this evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity. any change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.
critical accounting policies and estimates a critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, complex and/or subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") requires management to make certain judgments, estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be applicable and evaluate them on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain reasonable under current conditions. actual results could differ significantly from those estimates, which could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. our critical accounting estimates include:
•   the recognition and valuation of revenue from arrangements with multiple performance obligations which impacts revenue;
•   the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes, including the measurement of uncertain tax positions, which impact our provision for income tax expenses; and
•   the valuation and recoverability of long-lived assets, which impacts gross margin and operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation or amortization.
we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements regarding the critical accounting estimates indicated above. see note 2, "summary of significant accounting policies," of our consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this 2019 form 10-k for additional information regarding our accounting policies.
revenue recognition: on june 25, 2018, we adopted fasb asu no. 2014-09 (asc 606) - revenue from contracts with customers which provides guidance for revenue recognition that superseded the revenue recognition requirements in asc 605, revenue recognition and most industry specific guidance.
we recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services by following a five-step process, (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price, and (5) recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation, as further described below.
identify the contract with a customer. we generally consider documentation of terms with an approved purchase order as a customer contract, provided that collection is considered probable, which is assessed based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks, payment histories, and/or other circumstances.
identify the performance obligations in the contract. performance obligations include sales of systems, spare parts, and services. in addition, our customer contracts contain provisions for installation and training services which have been deemed immaterial in the context of the contract.
determine the transaction price. the transaction price for our contracts with customers consists of both fixed and variable consideration provided it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur when the uncertainty related to variable consideration is resolved. fixed consideration includes amounts to be contractually billed to the customer while variable consideration includes estimates for discounts and credits for future usage which are based on contractual terms outlined in volume purchase agreements and other factors known at the time. we generally invoice customers at shipment and for professional services either as provided or upon meeting certain milestones. customer invoices are generally due within 30 to 90 days after issuance.
continues on next page lam research corporation 2019 10-k our contracts with customers typically do not include significant financing components as the period between the transfer of performance obligations and timing of payment are generally within one year.
allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. for contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. standalone selling prices are based on multiple factors including, but not limited to historical discounting trends for products and services and pricing practices in different geographies.
inventory valuation: our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories including manufacturing raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods, and spare parts in each reporting period. obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management's estimated usage requirement is written down to its estimated net realizable value if less than cost. estimates of market value include but are not limited to management's forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules, customer demand, technological and/or market obsolescence, general semiconductor market conditions, and possible alternative uses. if future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period in which we make the revision.
warranty: we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system when we recognize revenue. we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified. we do not maintain general or unspecified reserves; all warranty reserves are related to specific systems.
income taxes: deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. in the event that we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment will be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance will be reversed.
we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.
long-lived assets: we review goodwill at least annually for impairment. if certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests, we will perform an impairment test at that date. in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, we: (1) allocate goodwill to the reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates; (2) estimate the fair value of our reporting units; and (3) determine the carrying value (book value) of those reporting units. prior to this allocation of the assets to the reporting units, we assess long-lived assets for impairment. furthermore, if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we must estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of that reporting unit, in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business. this can require independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets such as in-process r&d and developed technology. only after this process is completed can the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, be determined. in our goodwill impairment process we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative analysis. we do not calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount.
continues on next page lam research corporation 2019 10-k the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis. we determine the fair value of our reporting units by using an income approach. under the income approach, we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn.
in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit, we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of our reporting units, including estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment. although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit. in addition, we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units. changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge.
as a result, several factors could result in an impairment of a material amount of our goodwill balance in future periods, including but not limited to: (1) weakening of the global economy, weakness in the semiconductor equipment industry, or our failure to reach internal forecasts, which could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted levels of cash flows and reduce the estimated discounted cash flow value of our reporting units; and (2) a decline in our common stock price and resulting market capitalization, to the extent we determine that the decline is sustained and indicates a reduction in the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. further, the value assigned to intangible assets, other than goodwill, is based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations such as the success and lifecycle of products and technology acquired. if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates, we may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value.
recent accounting pronouncements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements, see note 3, "recent accounting pronouncements," of our consolidated financial statements, included in part ii, item 8 of this 2019 form 10-k.
liquidity and capital resources total gross cash, cash equivalents, investments, and restricted cash and investments balances were $5.7 billion at the end of fiscal year 2019 compared to $5.2 billion at the end of fiscal year 2018. this increase was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities and the issuance of $2.5 billion of senior notes, partially offset by common stock repurchases in connection with our stock repurchase program and dividends paid.
continues on next page lam research corporation 2019 10-k cash flow from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities of $3.2 billion during fiscal year 2019 consisted of (in millions):
equity-based compensation expense                         187
changes in operating asset and liability accounts         492
significant changes in operating asset and liability accounts, net of foreign exchange impact, included the following sources of cash: decreases in accounts receivable of $732 million and inventories of $281 million; partially offset by uses of cash: decreases in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $195 million, deferred profit of $178 million, accounts payable of $131 million, and prepaid assets of $18 million.
cash flow from investing activities net cash used by investing activities during fiscal year 2019 was $1.6 billion, primarily consisting of net purchases of available-for-sale securities of $1.3 billion, along with capital expenditures of $303 million.
cash flow from financing activities net cash used by financing activities during fiscal year 2019 was $2.4 billion, primarily consisting of $3.8 billion in common stock repurchases, $678 million of dividends paid, $2.0 billion of net proceeds from issuance of debt, and $85 million of stock issuance and treasury stock reissuances associated with our employee stock-based compensation plans.
liquidity given that the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and has historically experienced rapid changes in demand, we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in r&d and capital infrastructure. anticipated cash flows from operations based on our current business outlook, combined with our current levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of june 30, 2019, are expected to be sufficient to support our anticipated levels of operations, investments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures, capital redistributions, and dividends through at least the next twelve months. however, uncertainty in the global economy and the semiconductor industry, as well as disruptions in credit markets, have in the past, and could in the future, impact customer demand for our products, as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers, and creditors.
in the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products and services. while we have substantial cash balances, we may require additional funding and need or choose to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. we believe that, if necessary, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives. however, given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences, there can be no assurance that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us.
continues on next page lam research corporation 2019 10-k off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we have certain obligations to make future payments under various contracts, some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some of which are not. obligations that are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with gaap include our long-term debt which is outlined in the following table. our off-balance sheet arrangements are presented as operating leases and purchase obligations in the table. our contractual obligations and commitments as of june 30, 2019, relating to these agreements and our guarantees are included in the following table based on their contractual maturity date.
the amounts in the table below exclude $373 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax benefits as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or time of settlement. see note 7 of our consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8 of this 2019 form 10-k for further discussion. the amounts in the table below also exclude $10 million associated with funding commitments related to non-marketable equity investments as we are unable to make a reasonable estimate regarding the timing of capital calls.
capital leases (1)                                                                 50,049                  7,729                     17,422                 10,097                   14,801

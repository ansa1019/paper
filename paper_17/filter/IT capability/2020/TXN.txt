item 1a. risk factors you should read the following risk factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the securities and exchange commission (sec) and in materials incorporated by reference into these filings. these risk factors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to ti, a company with broad international operations. like many companies, we are susceptible to a potential downturn associated with macroeconomic weakness, which may affect our performance and the performance of our customers. similarly, the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions, actual financial results that do not meet our and/or the investment community's expectations, changes in our and/or the investment community's expectations for our future results, dividends or share repurchases, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.
risks related to our business and industry the extent to which the covid-19 pandemic will adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition is uncertain.
the global spread of the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), and the coronavirus disease, covid-19, has created significant uncertainty and economic disruption, both near-term and potentially long-term. we have modified, and might further modify, our business practices in response to the covid-19 pandemic, related third-party responses, including from government authorities and our suppliers, customers and distributors, and the economic and social ramifications of the disease and societal responses across the markets in which ti operates. the extent to which the covid-19 pandemic will continue to affect our business, results of operation and financial condition is difficult to predict and depends on numerous evolving factors including: the duration and scope of the pandemic; government, social, business and other actions that have been and will be taken in response to the pandemic; and the effect of the pandemic on short- and long-term general economic conditions. we might experience short- or long-term constrained supply or volatility in customer demand, which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results in future periods.
our global operations subject us to risks associated with domestic or international political, social, economic or other conditions.
we have facilities in more than 30 countries. about 90% of our revenue comes from shipments to locations outside the united states; shipments of products to china-based customers represent about 20% of our revenue. certain countries where we operate have experienced, and other countries may experience, trade tension that affects global trade and macroeconomic conditions through the enactment of tariffs, import or export restrictions, trade embargoes and sanctions, restrictions on cross-border investment and other trade barriers. trade tensions impact our ability to deliver products and product support into china, cause chinese customers to seek alternate suppliers and could otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results.
we are exposed to political, social and economic conditions, security risks, terrorism or other hostile acts, health conditions and epidemics, labor conditions, and possible disruptions in transportation, communications and information technology networks of the various countries in which we operate. in addition, our global operations expose us to periods when the u.s. dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the non-u.s. currencies in which we transact business. the remeasurement of non-u.s. dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
we face substantial competition that requires us to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures.
we face intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate. we expect this competition will continue to increase from large competitors and from small competitors serving niche markets, and also from emerging companies, particularly in asia, that sell products into the same markets in which we operate. for example, we may face increased competition as a result of china actively promoting and reshaping its domestic semiconductor industry through policy changes and investment. these actions, in conjunction with trade tensions, may restrict us from participating in the china market or may prevent us from competing effectively. certain competitors possess sufficient financial, technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against our products, and consolidation among our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively. the price and product development pressures that result from competition may lead to reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match the price declines or cost efficiencies, or meet the technological, product, support, software or manufacturing advancements of our competitors.
changes in expected demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
our customers include companies in a wide range of end markets and sectors within those markets. if demand in one or more sectors within our end markets declines or the rate of growth slows, our results of operations may be adversely affected. the cyclical nature of the semiconductor market occasionally leads to significant and rapid increases and decreases in product demand. additionally, the loss or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our large customers, including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers, the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments, changes in demand for customer products, or trade restrictions, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
our results of operations also might suffer because of a general decline in customer demand resulting from, for example: uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets; natural events, epidemics or domestic or international political, social, economic or other conditions; breaches of customer information technology systems that disrupt customer operations; or a customer's inability to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity.
our ability to match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill orders may affect our ability to meet a quarter's revenue forecast. we manufacture products based on forecasts of customers' demands. these forecasts are based on multiple assumptions, and if inaccurate, could cause us to hold inadequate, excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
our operating results and our reputation could be adversely affected by breaches, disruptions or other incidents relating to our information technology systems.
breaches, disruptions or other incidents relating to our information technology systems or the systems of our customers, vendors and other third parties could be caused by factors such as computer viruses, system failures, restricted network access, unauthorized access, terrorism, employee malfeasance, or human error. these events could, among other things, compromise our information technology networks; result in corrupt or lost data or the unauthorized release of our, our customers' or our suppliers' confidential or proprietary information; cause a disruption to our manufacturing and other operations; result in the release of personal data; or cause us to incur costs associated with increased protection, remediation, regulatory inquiries or penalties, or claims for damages, any of which could adversely affect our operating results and our reputation. cybersecurity or other threats to our information technology systems or the systems of our customers, vendors and other third parties are frequent and constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of defending against them.
our ability to successfully implement strategic, business and organizational changes could affect our business plans and results of operations.
from time to time, we undertake strategic, business and organizational changes, including acquisitions, divestitures and restructuring actions, to support or carry out our objectives. if we do not successfully implement these changes, our business plans and operating results could be adversely affected. we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth, cost savings or other benefits of strategic, business and organizational changes, and charges associated with these actions could differ materially in amount and timing from our expectations.
we have manufacturing, data and design facilities and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather, geological events or epidemics that could disrupt operations. a natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption, particularly where we have principal manufacturing and design operations, as listed in the properties section in item 2, may adversely affect our results and financial condition.
rapid technological change in markets we serve requires us to develop new technologies and products.
rapid technological change in markets we serve could contribute to shortened product life cycles and a decline in average selling prices of our products. our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop, manufacture and market innovative products in a timely and cost-effective manner. we make significant investments in research and development to improve existing technology and products, develop new products to meet changing customer demands, and improve our production processes. in some cases, we might not realize a return or the expected return on our investments because they are generally made before commercial viability can be assured. further, projects that are commercially viable may not contribute to our operating results until at least a few years after they are completed.
we face supply chain and manufacturing risks.
we rely on third parties to supply us with goods and services in a cost-effective and timely manner. our access to needed goods and services may be adversely affected by potential disputes with suppliers or disruptions in our suppliers' operations as a result of, for example: quality excursions; uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets; domestic or international political, social, economic and other conditions; natural events or epidemics in the locations in which our suppliers operate; or limited or delayed access to key raw materials, natural resources and utilities. additionally, a breach or other incident relating to our suppliers' information technology systems could result in a release of confidential or proprietary information. if our suppliers are unable to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity, we may be unable to obtain needed supplies, collect accounts receivable or access needed technology.
in particular, our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment require that certain key raw materials, natural resources and utilities be available. limited or delayed access to and high costs of these items could adversely affect our results of operations. our products contain materials that are subject to conflict minerals reporting requirements. our relationships with customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if we are unable to describe our products as conflict-free. additionally, our costs may increase if one or more of our customers demand that we change the sourcing of materials we cannot identify as conflict-free.
our inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations. we subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our products, and we depend on third parties to provide advanced logic manufacturing process technology development. we do not have long-term contracts with all of these suppliers, and the number of alternate suppliers is limited. reliance on these suppliers involves risks, including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand, suppliers' inability to develop and deliver advanced logic manufacturing process technology in a timely, cost-effective, and appropriate manner, the possibility of suppliers' imposition of increased costs on us and the unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property.
our results of operations and our reputation could be affected by warranty claims, product liability claims, product recalls or legal proceedings.
claims based on warranty, product liability, epidemic or delivery failures, or other grounds relating to our products, manufacturing, services, designs, communications or cybersecurity could lead to significant expenses as we defend the claims or pay damage awards or settlements. in the event of a claim, we would also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer. any such claims may also cause us to write off the value of related inventory. we maintain product liability insurance, but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims. in addition, it is possible for a customer to recall a product containing a ti part, for example, with respect to products used in automotive applications or handheld electronics, which may cause us to incur costs and expenses relating to the recall. any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and reputation.
our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if a customer or a distributor suffers a loss with respect to our inventory.
we have consignment inventory programs in place for some of our largest customers and distributors. if a customer or distributor were to experience a loss with respect to ti-consigned inventory, our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected if we do not recover the full value of the lost inventory from the customer, distributor or insurer, or if our recovery is delayed.
our results of operations could be adversely affected by distributors' promotion of competing product lines or our distributors' financial performance.
in 2020, about half of our revenue was generated from sales of our products through distributors. our distributors carry competing product lines, and our sales could be affected if semiconductor distributors promote competing products over our products. moreover, our results of operations could be affected if our distributors suffer financial difficulties that result in their inability to pay amounts owed to us. disputes with current or former distributors could be disruptive or harmful to our business.
our profit margins vary due to a number of factors, which may include customer demand and shipment volume; our manufacturing processes; product mix; inventory levels; tariffs; freight costs; and new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting practices or standards. in addition, we operate in a highly competitive market environment that might adversely affect pricing for our products. because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed. in general, these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or factory loadings, and can adversely affect profit margins as a result.
our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environment.
our continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel, as well as the effective management of succession for key employees. skilled and experienced personnel in our industry, including engineering, management, marketing, technical and staff personnel, are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense. there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key engineering, management and technical personnel that we require to execute our business strategy. our ability to recruit internationally or deploy employees to various locations may be limited by immigration laws.
legal and regulatory risks our operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject.
we are subject to complex laws, rules and regulations affecting our domestic and international operations relating to, for example, the environment and climate change, safety and health; trade; bribery and corruption; financial reporting; tax; data privacy and protection; labor and employment; competition; market access; epidemics; intellectual property ownership and infringement; and the movement of currency. compliance with these laws, rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive and could restrict our ability to manufacture or ship our products and operate our business. if we do not comply or if we become subject to enforcement activity, we could be subject to fines, penalties or other legal liability. furthermore, should these laws, rules and regulations be amended or expanded, or new ones enacted, we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business.
some of these complex laws, rules and regulations - for example, those related to environmental, safety and health requirements - may particularly affect us in the jurisdictions in which we manufacture products, especially if such laws and regulations: require the use of abatement equipment beyond what we currently employ; require the addition or elimination of a raw material or process to or from our current manufacturing processes; or impose costs, fees or reporting requirements on the direct or indirect use of energy, natural resources, or materials or gases used or emitted into the environment in connection with the manufacture of our products. a substitute for a prohibited raw material or process might not be available, or might not be available at reasonable cost.
our results of operations could be affected by changes in tax-related matters.
we have facilities in more than 30 countries and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities. tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate. if our tax rate increases, our results of operations could be adversely affected. a number of factors could cause our tax rate to increase, including a change in the jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed; a change in the mix of profits from those jurisdictions; changes in available tax credits or deductions, including for amounts relating to stock compensation; changes in applicable tax rates; changes in tariff regulations or surcharges; changes in accounting principles; or adverse resolution of audits by taxing authorities. we have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. changes in applicable tax laws and regulations or in our business performance could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets, which could also affect our results of operations.
in addition, we are subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction. these laws and regulations can be complex and subject to interpretation. changes in these laws and regulations, including those that align with the organisation for economic cooperation and development's base erosion and profit shifting recommendations, could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income, which could in turn affect our results of operations. each quarter we forecast our tax expense based on our forecast of our performance for the year. if that performance forecast changes, our forecasted tax expense will change.
our performance depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and to maintain freedom of operation.
access to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio in all jurisdictions where we conduct business. there can be no assurance that, as our business evolves, we will obtain the necessary intellectual property rights, or that we will be able to independently develop the technology, software or know-how necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others. to the extent that we have to rely on technology from others for which a license is required, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such a license at all or on terms we consider reasonable. we, directly and indirectly, face infringement claims from third parties, including non-practicing entities that have acquired patents to pursue enforcement actions against other companies. we also face infringement claims where we or our customers make, use or sell products and where the intellectual property laws may be less established or less predictable. these assertions, whether or not of any merit, expose us to claims for damages and/or injunctions from third parties, as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have a contractual or other legal obligation to indemnify them against damages resulting from infringement claims.
we actively enforce and protect our own intellectual property rights. however, our efforts cannot prevent all misappropriation or improper use of our protected technology and information, including, for example, third parties' use of our patented or copyrighted technology, or our trade secrets in their products without the right to do so, or third parties' sale of counterfeit products bearing our trademark. the risk of unfair copying or cloning may impede our ability to sell our products. the laws of countries where we operate may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as u.s. laws.
increases in health care and pension benefit costs could affect our results of operations and financial condition.
federal and state health care reform programs could increase our costs with regard to medical coverage of our employees, which could reduce profitability and affect our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, obligations related to our pension and other postretirement plans reflect assumptions that affect the planned funding and costs of these plans, including the actual return on plan assets, discount rates, plan participant population demographics and changes in pension regulations. changes in these assumptions may affect plan funding, cash flow and results of operations, and our costs and funding obligations could increase significantly if our plans' actual experience differs from these assumptions.
risks related to our financing activities and other risks our debt could affect our operations and financial condition.
from time to time, we issue debt securities with various interest rates and maturities. while we believe we will have the ability to service this debt, our ability to make principal and interest payments when due depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles, and business and other factors affecting our operations, including our other risk factors, many of which are beyond our control. in addition, our obligation to make principal and interest payments could divert funds that otherwise might be invested in our operations or returned to shareholders, or could cause us to raise funds by, for example, issuing new debt or equity or selling assets.
our results of operations and liquidity could be affected by changes in the financial markets.
we maintain bank accounts, one or more multiyear revolving credit agreements, and a portfolio of investments to support the financing needs of the company. our ability to fund our operations, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, service our debt obligations and meet our cash return objectives depends upon continuous access to our bank and investment accounts, and may depend on access to our bank credit lines that support commercial paper borrowings and provide additional liquidity through short-term bank loans. if we are unable to access these accounts and credit lines (for example, due to instability in the financial markets), our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected and our ability to access the capital markets or redeem our investments could be restricted.
material impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our results of operations.
we have a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet. charges associated with impairments of goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. technology is the foundation of our company, but ultimately, our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate long-term value for owners is the growth of free cash flow per share.
our strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth has three elements:
1.a great business model that is focused on analog and embedded processing products and built around four sustainable competitive advantages. the four sustainable competitive advantages are powerful in combination and provide tangible benefits:
i.a strong foundation of manufacturing and technology that provides lower costs and greater control of our supply chain.
ii.a broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products that offers more opportunity per customer and more value for our investments.
iii.the reach of our market channels that gives access to more customers and more of their design projects, leading to the opportunity to sell more of our products into each design and gives us better insight and knowledge of customer needs.
iv.diversity and longevity of our products, markets and customer positions that provide less single point dependency and longer returns on our investments.
together, these competitive advantages help position ti in a unique class of companies capable of generating and returning significant amounts of cash for our owners. we make our investments with an eye towards long-term strengthening and leveraging of these advantages.
2.discipline in allocating capital to the best opportunities. this spans how we select r&d projects, develop new capabilities like ti.com, invest in new manufacturing capacity or how we think about acquisitions and returning cash to our owners.
3.efficiency, which means constantly striving for more output for every dollar spent.
we believe that our business model with the combined effect of our four competitive advantages sets ti apart from our peers and will for a long time to come. we will invest to strengthen our competitive advantages, be disciplined in capital allocation and stay diligent in our pursuit of efficiencies. finally, we will remain focused on the belief that long-term growth of free cash flow per share is the ultimate measure to generate value.
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. in the following discussion of our results of operations:
•our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels, and how management allocates resources and measures results. during 2020, we reorganized the product lines within our analog segment to simplify our business structure into our power and signal chain product lines. these changes had no impact on our previously reported consolidated financial statements or on our reportable segment results. see note 1 to the financial statements for more information regarding our segments.
◦unless otherwise noted, changes in our revenue are attributable to changes in customer demand, which are evidenced by fluctuations in shipment volumes.
◦from time to time, our revenue and gross profit are affected by changes in demand for higher-priced or lower-priced products, which we refer to as changes in the "mix" of products shipped.
◦because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed. when factory loadings decrease, our fixed costs are spread over reduced output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins decrease. conversely, as factory loadings increase, our fixed costs are spread over increased output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins increase. increases and decreases in factory loadings tend to correspond to increases and decreases in demand.
•for an explanation of free cash flow and the term "annual operating tax rate," see the non-gaap financial information section.
our results of operations provides details of our financial results for 2020 and 2019 and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. discussion of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this form 10-k can be found in "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in part ii, item 7 of the company's annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2019.
the coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic and its follow-on effects are impacting and will likely continue to impact business activity across industries worldwide, including ti. therefore, we remain cautious about how the economy might behave for the next few years.
the impact to our lead times and ability to fulfill orders was minimal in 2020. however, depending on pandemic-related factors like the potential of local manufacturing restrictions on our factories, we could experience constraints in fulfilling customer orders in future periods. the coronavirus pandemic remains dynamic with uncertainty around its duration and broader impact. we continue to monitor and assess the situation and address implications to our business, supply chain and customer demand.
we have long had a business continuity plan in place for unforeseeable situations, like we have seen with covid-19. additionally, over the past several years, we have invested in building inventory and expanding our global internally owned manufacturing footprint. investing in these capabilities has given us flexibility, such as the ability to build products across multiple manufacturing sites. these investments have helped to minimize disruptions, but may not be sufficient to eliminate them.
results of operations our strategic focus is on analog and embedded processing products sold into six end markets: industrial, automotive, personal electronics, communications equipment, enterprise systems and other. while all end markets represent good opportunities, we place additional strategic emphasis on designing and selling those products into the industrial and automotive markets, which we believe represent the best growth opportunities. gross margin of 64.1% reflected the quality of our product portfolio, as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, including the benefit of 300-millimeter analog production.
our focus on analog and embedded processing allows us to generate strong cash flow from operations. our cash flow from operations of $6.14 billion underscored the strength of our business model. free cash flow was $5.49 billion and represented 38.0% of revenue. during 2020, consistent with our commitment to return free cash flow to owners, we returned $5.98 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. our dividend represented 62% of free cash flow, underscoring its sustainability.
details of financial results - 2020 compared with 2019
revenue of $14.46 billion increased $78 million, or 1%, primarily due to higher revenue from analog, partially offset by lower revenue from embedded processing.
gross profit of $9.27 billion was up $105 million, or 1%, due to higher revenue and increased factory loadings. as a percentage of revenue, gross profit increased to 64.1% from 63.7%.
operating expenses (r&d and sg&a) were $3.15 billion compared with $3.19 billion.
acquisition charges were $198 million compared with $288 million and were non-cash. see note 7 to the financial statements.
restructuring charges/other was a charge of $24 million due to an embedded processing action, compared with a credit of $36 million due to the sale of our manufacturing facility in greenock, scotland in 2019.
operating profit was $5.89 billion, or 40.8% of revenue, compared with $5.72 billion, or 39.8% of revenue.
other income and expense (oi&e) was $313 million of income compared with $175 million of income, which increased primarily due to higher royalty income. see note 12 to the financial statements.
interest and debt expense of $190 million increased $20 million due to the issuance of additional long-term debt.
our provision for income taxes was $422 million compared with $711 million. the decrease was due to higher discrete tax benefits, which included a $249 million benefit from the settlement of a depreciation-related uncertain tax position and, to a lesser extent, higher u.s. tax benefits, partially offset by higher income before income taxes.
our annual operating tax rate, which does not include discrete tax items, was 14% compared with 16% in 2019. we use "annual operating tax rate" to describe the estimated annual effective tax rate. our effective tax rate, which includes discrete tax items, was 7% in 2020 compared with 12% in 2019. see note 4 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the u.s. statutory corporate tax rate to our effective tax rate.
net income was $5.60 billion compared with $5.02 billion. eps was $5.97 compared with $5.24.

financial condition at the end of 2020, total cash (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments) was $6.57 billion, an increase of $1.18 billion from the end of 2019.
accounts receivable were $1.41 billion, an increase of $340 million compared with the end of 2019. days sales outstanding at the end of 2020 were 31 compared with 29 at the end of 2019.
inventory was $1.96 billion, a decrease of $46 million from the end of 2019. days of inventory at the end of 2020 were 123 compared with 144 at the end of 2019.
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations. additional sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and a variable rate, revolving credit facility. cash flows from operating activities for 2020 were $6.14 billion, a decrease of $510 million primarily due to an increase in cash used for working capital, partially offset by higher net income.
our revolving credit facility is with a consortium of investment-grade banks and allows us to borrow up to $2 billion until march 2024. this credit facility also serves as support for the issuance of commercial paper. as of december 31, 2020, our credit facility was undrawn, and we had no commercial paper outstanding.
investing activities for 2020 used $922 million compared with $1.92 billion in 2019. capital expenditures were $649 million compared with $847 million in 2019 and were primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment and facilities in both periods. short-term investments used cash of $241 million in 2020 compared with $1.14 billion in 2019.
financing activities for 2020 used $4.55 billion compared with $4.73 billion in 2019. in 2020, we received net proceeds of $1.50 billion from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt and retired maturing debt of $500 million. in 2019, we received net proceeds of $1.49 billion from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt and retired maturing debt of $750 million. dividends paid in 2020 were $3.43 billion compared with $3.01 billion in 2019, reflecting an increase in the dividend rate, partially offset by fewer shares outstanding. we used $2.55 billion to repurchase 23.4 million shares of our common stock compared with $2.96 billion used in 2019 to repurchase 27.4 million shares. employee exercises of stock options provided cash proceeds of $470 million compared with $539 million in 2019.
we had $3.11 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $3.46 billion of short-term investments as of december 31, 2020. we believe we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend and debt-related payments and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months.
non-gaap financial information this md&a includes references to free cash flow and ratios based on that measure. these are financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states (gaap). free cash flow was calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from the most directly comparable gaap measure, cash flows from operating activities (also referred to as cash flow from operations).
we believe that free cash flow and the associated ratios provide insight into our liquidity, our cash-generating capability and the amount of cash potentially available to return to shareholders, as well as insight into our financial performance. these non-gaap measures are supplemental to the comparable gaap measures.
for years ended december 31, capital expenditures                                                  (649)                               (847)
this md&a also includes references to an annual operating tax rate, a non-gaap term we use to describe the estimated annual effective tax rate, a gaap measure that by definition does not include discrete tax items. we believe the term annual operating tax rate helps differentiate from the effective tax rate, which includes discrete tax items.

transition tax on indefinitely reinvested earnings (c)                         44                     155                        302                          -                        501
(a)principal and related interest payments for our long-term debt obligations, including amounts classified as the current portion of long-term debt.
(b)includes payments for software licenses and contractual arrangements with suppliers when there is a fixed, non-cancellable payment schedule or when minimum payments are due with a reduced delivery schedule. excludes cancellable arrangements. see note 11 to the financial statements.
(c)includes payments for the one-time transition tax on our indefinitely reinvested earnings related to the 2017 enactment of the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act.
(d)includes minimum payments for leased facilities and equipment and purchases of industrial gases under contracts accounted for as operating leases. see note 10 to the financial statements.
(e)estimated payments for certain liabilities that existed as of december 31, 2020.
(f)excludes $89 million of uncertain tax liabilities under asc 740, as well as any planned future funding contributions to retirement benefit plans. amounts associated with uncertain tax liabilities have been excluded because of the difficulty in making reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities. regarding future funding of retirement benefit plans, we plan to contribute about $10 million in 2021, but funding projections beyond 2021 are not practical to estimate due to the rules affecting tax-deductible contributions and the impact from the plans' asset performance, interest rates and potential u.s. and non-u.s. legislation.
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. as disclosed in note 2, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. however, based on facts and circumstances inherent in developing estimates and assumptions, management believes it is unlikely that applying other estimates and assumptions would have a material impact on the financial statements. we consider the following accounting policies to be those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and that require a higher degree of judgment.
income taxes in determining net income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax provisions and the resultant tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense.
in the ordinary course of global business, there may be many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the interpretation and application of complex tax laws, and significant judgment is necessary to (i) determine whether, based on the technical merits, a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and (ii) measure the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. although we believe the estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals.
as part of our financial process, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered. if recovery is not likely, the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to be ultimately recoverable. our judgment regarding future recoverability of our deferred tax assets may change due to various factors, including changes in u.s. or international tax laws and changes in market conditions and their impact on our assessment of taxable income in future periods. these changes, if any, may require adjustments to the deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in net income in the period when such determinations are made.
inventory valuation allowances inventory is valued net of allowances for unsalable or obsolete raw materials, work in process and finished goods. statistical allowances are determined quarterly for raw materials and work in process based on historical disposals of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons. for finished goods, quarterly statistical allowances are determined by comparing inventory levels of individual parts to historical shipments, current backlog and estimated future sales in order to identify inventory considered unlikely to be sold. a specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is a significant event not captured by the statistical allowance, such as an end-of-life part or demand with imminent risk of cancellation. allowances are also calculated quarterly for instances where inventoried costs for individual products are in excess of the net realizable value for those products. actual future write-offs of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons may differ from estimates and calculations used to determine valuation allowances due to changes in customer demand, customer negotiations, technology shifts and other factors.
changes in accounting standards see note 2 to the financial statements for information regarding the status of new accounting and reporting standards.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2020, we had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of sec regulation s-k.

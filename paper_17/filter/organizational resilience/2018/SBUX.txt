item 1a. risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below. if any of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. moreover, we operate in an increasingly competitive and rapidly changing environment. new factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict the impact of all these factors on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
•   economic conditions in the u.s. and international markets could adversely affect our business and financial results.
as a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending, our results of operations are sensitive to changes in or uncertainty about macro-economic conditions. our customers may have less money for discretionary purchases and may stop or reduce their purchases of our products or trade down to starbucks or competitors' lower priced products as a result of job losses, foreclosures, bankruptcies, increased fuel and energy costs, higher interest rates, inflation, higher taxes, reduced access to credit, economic uncertainty and potential negative impacts relating to federal economic policy changes and recent international trade disputes. these factors may also result in a general downturn in the restaurant industry. decreases in customer traffic and/or average value per transaction will negatively impact our financial performance as reduced revenues without a corresponding decrease in expenses result in sales de-leveraging, which creates downward pressure on margins and also negatively impacts comparable store sales, net revenues, operating income and earnings per share. there is also a risk that if negative economic conditions or uncertainty persist for a long period of time or worsen, consumers may make long-lasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior, including less frequent discretionary purchases on a more permanent basis.
•   our success depends substantially on the value of our brands and failure to preserve their value, either through our actions or those of our business partners, could have a negative impact on our financial results.
we believe we have built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of our products, for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience and for our global social impact programs. the starbucks brand is recognized throughout the world and we have received high ratings in global brand value studies. to be successful in the future, particularly outside of the u.s., where the starbucks brand and our other brands are less well-known, we believe we must preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brands across all sales channels. brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities.
additionally, our business strategy, including our plans for new stores, branded products and other initiatives, relies significantly on a variety of business partners, including licensee and joint venture relationships, particularly in our international markets, and third-party manufacturers, distributors and retailers, particularly for our entire global channel development business. licensees, retailers and foodservice operators are often authorized to use our logos and provide branded food, beverage and other products directly to customers. we provide training and support to, and monitor the operations of, certain of these business partners, but the product quality and service they deliver may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control, including financial pressures they may face. we believe customers expect the same quality of products and service from our licensed-store operators as they do from us and we strive to ensure customers receive the same quality of products and service experience whether they visit a company-operated store or a licensed store. we also source our food, beverage and other products from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply chain operations, and in certain cases such products are produced or sourced by our licensees directly. and although foodservice operators are authorized to use our logos and provide branded products as part of their foodservice business, we do not monitor the quality of non-starbucks products served in those locations. additionally, inconsistent uses of our brand and other of our intellectual property assets, as well as failure to protect our intellectual property, including from unauthorized uses of our brand or other of our intellectual property assets, can erode consumer trust and our brand value and have a material negative impact on our financial results.
business incidents, whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us or our business partners, that erode consumer trust, such as actual or perceived breaches of privacy or violations of domestic or international privacy laws, contaminated food, product recalls, store employees or other food handlers infected with communicable diseases or other potential incidents discussed in this risk factors section, particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity, including rapidly through social or digital media (including for malicious reasons), or result in litigation, and failure to respond appropriately to these incidents (or being perceived to not have reacted appropriately), can significantly reduce brand value, trigger boycotts of our stores or products or demonstrations at our stores, result in civil and criminal liability and have a negative impact on our financial results. consumer demand for our products and our brand equity could diminish significantly if we, our employees or our licensees or other business partners fail to preserve the quality of our products, act or are perceived to act in an unethical, illegal, racially-biased or unequal treatment basis or socially irresponsible manner, including with respect to the sourcing, content or sale of our products, service and treatment at starbucks stores or the use of customer data for general or direct marketing or other purposes, fail to comply with laws and regulations, publicly take controversial positions or actions or fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience in each of our markets, including by failing to invest in the right balance of wages and benefits to attract and retain employees that represent the brand well.
•   incidents involving food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, adulteration, contamination or mislabeling, whether or not accurate, as well as adverse public or medical opinions about the health effects of consuming our products, could harm our business.
instances or reports, whether true or not, of unclean water supply or food-safety issues, such as food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, adulteration, contamination or mislabeling, either during growing, manufacturing, packaging, storing or preparation, have in the past severely injured the reputations of companies in the food and beverage processing, grocery and quick-service restaurant sectors and could affect us as well. any report linking us to the use of unclean water, food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, adulteration, contamination, mislabeling or other food or beverage-safety issues could damage our brand value and severely hurt sales of our food and beverage products and possibly lead to product liability claims, litigation (including class actions) or damages. clean water is critical to the preparation of coffee, tea and other beverages, as well as ice for our cold beverages, and our ability to ensure a clean water and ice supply to our stores can be limited, particularly in some international locations. we are also continuing to incorporate more products in our food and beverage lineup that require freezing or refrigeration, including produce (such as fruits and vegetables in our salads and juices), dairy products (such as milk and cheeses), non-dairy alternative products (such as soymilk and almondmilk), ice for our cold drinks and meats. we also face risk by relying on third-party food suppliers to provide and transport ingredients and finished products to our stores. we monitor the operations of certain of these business partners, but the product quality and service they deliver may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control, which make it more difficult to detect contamination or other defect in these products. additionally, we are evolving our product lineup to include more local or smaller suppliers for some of our products who may not have as rigorous quality and safety systems and protocols as larger or more national suppliers. if customers become ill from food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, adulteration, contamination, mislabeling or other food or beverage-safety issues, we could be forced to temporarily close some stores and/or supply chain facilities, as well as recall products. in addition, instances of food or beverage-safety issues, even those involving solely the restaurants or stores of competitors or of suppliers or distributors (regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors), could, by resulting in negative publicity about us or the foodservice industry in general, adversely affect our sales on a regional or global basis. a decrease in customer traffic as a result of food-safety concerns or negative publicity, or as a result of a temporary closure of any of our stores, product recalls or food or beverage-safety claims or litigation, could materially harm our business and results of operations.
some of our products contain caffeine, dairy products, sugar and other compounds and allergens, the health effects of which are the subject of public and regulatory scrutiny, including the suggestion that excessive consumption of caffeine, dairy products, sugar and other compounds can lead to a variety of adverse health effects. particularly in the u.s., there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks, including obesity, due in part to increased publicity and attention from health organizations, as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food and beverage products. while we have a variety of beverage and food items, including items that are coffee-free and have reduced calories, an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products, whether accurate or not, imposition of additional taxes on certain types of beverages, or negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our beverages and food products and could materially harm our business and results of operations.
•   the unauthorized access, use, theft or destruction of customer or employee personal, financial or other data or of starbucks proprietary or confidential information that is stored in our information systems or by third parties on our behalf could impact our reputation and brand and expose us to potential liability and loss of revenues.
many of our information technology systems, such as those we use for our point-of-sale, web and mobile platforms, including online and mobile payment systems, delivery services and rewards programs, and for administrative functions, including human resources, payroll, accounting and internal and external communications, as well as the information technology systems of our licensees, franchisees and other third-party business partners and service providers, whether cloud-based or hosted in proprietary servers, contain personal, financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and employees. many of our information technology systems also contain starbucks proprietary and other confidential information related to our business, such as business plans, product development initiatives and designs. similar to many other retail companies and because of the prominence of our brand, we are consistently subject to attempts to compromise our information technology systems. to the extent we or a third party were to experience a material breach of our or such third party's information technology systems that result in the unauthorized access, theft, use, destruction or other compromises of customers' or employees' data or confidential information of the company stored in such systems, including through cyber-attacks or other external or internal methods, it could result in a material loss of revenues from the potential adverse impact to our reputation and brand, our ability to retain or attract new customers and the potential disruption to our business and plans. such security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable u.s. and international privacy and other laws, and subject us to private consumer, business partner, or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability. for example, the european union adopted a new regulation that became effective in may 2018, called the general data protection regulation ("gdpr"), which requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data, including its use, protection and transfer and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves. failure to meet the gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of annual worldwide revenue. the gdpr also confers a private right of action on certain individuals and associations. our reputation and brand and our ability to attract new customers could also be adversely impacted if we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to properly respond to these incidents. such failure to properly respond could also result in similar exposure to liability.
compliance with the gdpr and other applicable international and u.s. privacy, cybersecurity and related laws can be costly and time-consuming. significant capital investments and other expenditures could also be required to remedy cybersecurity problems and prevent future breaches, including costs associated with additional security technologies, personnel, experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached. these costs, which could be material, could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred and may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems.
media or other reports of existing or perceived security vulnerabilities in our systems or those of our third-party business partners or service providers can also adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially impact our business, even if no breach has been attempted or has occurred. additionally, the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyber-attacks and breaches of information technology systems, as well as the sources and targets of these attacks, change frequently and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time. we continue to make significant investments in technology, third-party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and to prevent or minimize breaches of our information technology systems or data loss, but these security measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss.
•   we rely heavily on information technology in our operations and growth initiatives, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate and grow our business and could adversely affect our financial results.
we rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations, including for administrative functions, point-of-sale processing and payment in our stores and online, management of our supply chain, starbucks cards, online business, delivery services, mobile technology, including mobile payments and ordering apps, reloads and loyalty functionality and various other processes and transactions, and many of these systems are interdependent on one another for their functionality. additionally, the success of several of our initiatives to drive growth, including our priority to increase digital relationships with our customers to drive incremental traffic and spend, is highly dependent on our technology systems. our ability to effectively manage our business, launch digital and other initiatives, and coordinate the production, distribution, administration and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability, integrity and capacity of these systems. we also rely on third-party providers and platforms for some of these information technology systems and support. additionally, our systems hardware, software and services provided by third-party service providers are not fully redundant within a market or across our markets. although we have operational safeguards in place, they may not be effective in preventing the failure of these systems or platforms to operate effectively and be available. such failures may be caused by various factors, including power outages, catastrophic events, physical theft, computer and network failures, inadequate or ineffective redundancy, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or platforms, flaws in third-party software or services, errors or improper use by our employees or third party service providers, or a breach in the security of these systems or platforms, including through cyber-attacks such as those that result in the blockage of our or our third-party business partners' or service providers' systems and platforms and those discussed in more detail in this risk factors section. if our incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective manner they could result in an interruption in our operations and could cause material negative impacts to our product availability and sales, the efficiency of our operations and our financial results. in addition, remediation of any problems with our systems could result in significant, unplanned expenses.
•   we may not be successful in implementing important strategic initiatives or effectively managing growth, which may have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.
there is no assurance that we will be able to implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations or that they will generate expected returns, which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results. these strategic initiatives are designed to create growth, improve our results of operations and drive long-term shareholder value, and include:
•   being an employer of choice and investing in employees to deliver a superior customer experience;
•   building our leadership position around coffee;
•   driving convenience, brand engagement and digital relationships through our mobile, loyalty, delivery and digital capabilities both domestically and internationally;
•   simplifying store administrative tasks to allow store partners to better engage with customers;
•   increasing the scale of the starbucks store footprint with disciplined global expansion and introducing flexible and unique store formats;
•   moving to a more licensed store model in some markets and a more company-owned model in other markets;
•   creating new occasions in stores across all dayparts with new product offerings, including our growing lunch food and beverage product lineup;
•   continuing the global growth of our channel development business through our supply, distribution and licensing agreements with nestlé and other channel development business partners;
•   delivering continued growth in our cold beverage business, including our tea business through the teavana brand in our starbucks® retail stores and other channels and internationally; and in addition to other factors listed in this risk factors section, factors that may adversely affect the successful implementation of these initiatives, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results, include the following:
•   increases in labor costs, including wages and benefits, which, in a retail business such as ours, are two of our most significant costs, both domestically and internationally; these increases include significant and sudden increases in labor costs triggered by regulatory actions regarding wages and scheduling and benefits requirements; they also include increased health care and workers' compensation insurance costs, as well as increased wages and costs of other benefits necessary to attract and retain high quality employees with the right skill sets, whether due to changing industry practices, competition or our expansion into new channels or technology dependent operations;
•   not successfully developing and implementing new technologies necessary to effectuate our growth strategies, including increasing our digital relationships with customers to drive growth, due to inability to attract and retain qualified high-tech personnel or other factors;
•   increasing competition in channels in which we operate or seek to operate from new and existing large competitors or well-funded smaller ones that sell high-quality specialty coffee beverages;
•   consumers shifting categories of where they spend their discretionary income away from outside-the-home food and beverage;
•   imposition of additional taxes by jurisdictions, such as on certain types of beverages or based on number of employees;
•   construction cost increases associated with new store openings and remodeling of existing stores; delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control or a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates, either of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets in the u.s. and internationally;
•   not successfully scaling our supply chain infrastructure as our product offerings increase and as we continue to expand, including our emphasis on a broad range of high-quality food offerings;
•   the ability of our licensee partners to implement our growth platforms and product innovation;
•   lack of customer acceptance of new products (including due to price increases necessary to cover the costs of new products or higher input costs), brands (such as the global expansion of the teavana brand in our starbucks® retail stores and other channels) and platforms (such as features of our mobile technology, changes in our loyalty rewards programs and our delivery services initiatives), or customers reducing their demand for our current offerings as new products are introduced;
•   the degree to which we enter into, maintain, develop and are able to negotiate appropriate terms and conditions of, and enforce, commercial and other agreements and the performance of our business partners under such agreements;
•   not successfully consummating and implementing favorable strategic transactions or integrating acquired businesses, including our east china business;
•   the effects of the tax cuts and jobs act and related guidance and regulations that may be promulgated; and
•   the deterioration in our credit ratings, which could limit the availability of additional financing and increase the cost of obtaining financing to fund our initiatives.
our channel development business is heavily reliant on nestlé, which acquired the right to sell and distribute our packaged goods and foodservice products to retailers and operators, with few exceptions. if nestlé fails to perform its distribution and marketing commitments under our agreements and/or fails to support, protect and grow our brand in channel development, our channel development business could be adversely impacted for a period of time, present long-term challenges to our brand, limit our ability to grow our channel development business and have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results. additionally, our channel development business is also in part dependent on the level of support our retail business partners provide our products, and in some markets there are only a few retailers. if our retail business partners do not provide sufficient levels of support for our products, which is at their discretion, it could limit our ability to grow our channel development business.
also, a relatively small number of licensee partners own a large number of licensed stores. if such licensee partners are not able to access sufficient funds or financing, or are otherwise unable to successfully operate and grow their businesses, including their licensed stores, it could have a material adverse effect on our results in the markets in which they operate their licensed stores.
effectively managing growth can be challenging, particularly as we continue to expand into new channels outside the retail store model, implement our arrangement with nestlé for most of our global channel development business and grow our teavana brand in our starbucks® retail stores and other channels, as well as expand into new markets internationally where we must balance the need for flexibility and a degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with our goals, philosophy and standards. growth can make it increasingly difficult to ensure a consistent supply of high-quality raw materials, to locate and hire sufficient numbers of key employees, to maintain an effective system of internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise and to train employees worldwide to deliver a consistently high-quality product and customer experience. furthermore, if we are not successful in implementing these strategic initiatives, such as large acquisitions and integrations, we may be required to evaluate whether certain assets, including goodwill and other intangibles, have become impaired. in the event we record an impairment charge, it could have a material impact on our financial results.
•   we face intense competition in each of our channels and markets, which could lead to reduced profitability.
the specialty coffee market is intensely competitive, including with respect to product quality, innovation, service, convenience, such as delivery service and mobile ordering, and price, and we face significant and increasing competition in all these areas in each of our channels and markets. accordingly, we do not have leadership positions in all channels and markets. in the u.s., the ongoing focus by large competitors in the quick-service restaurant sector on selling high-quality specialty coffee beverages could lead to decreases in customer traffic to starbucks® stores and/or average value per transaction adversely affecting our sales and results of operations. similarly, continued competition from well-established competitors, or competition from large new entrants or well-funded smaller companies in our domestic and international markets could hinder growth and adversely affect our sales and results of operations in those markets. many small competitors also continue to open coffee specialty stores in many of our markets across the world, which in the aggregate may also lead to significant decreases of customer traffic to our stores in those markets. increased competition globally in packaged coffee and tea and single-serve and ready-to-drink coffee beverage markets, including from new and large entrants to this market could adversely affect the profitability of the channel development segment. furthermore, declines in general consumer demand for specialty coffee products for any reason, including due to consumer preference for other products or flattening demand for our products, could have a negative effect on our business.
•   we are highly dependent on the financial performance of our americas operating segment.
our financial performance is highly dependent on our americas operating segment, as it comprised approximately 68% of consolidated total net revenues in fiscal 2018. if the americas operating segment revenue trends slow or decline, especially in our u.s. and canada markets, our other segments may be unable to make up any significant shortfall and our business and financial results could be adversely affected. and because the americas segment is relatively mature and produces the large majority of our operating cash flows, such a slowdown or decline could result in reduced cash flows for funding the expansion of our international business and other initiatives and for returning cash to shareholders.
•   we are increasingly dependent on the success of certain international markets in order to achieve our growth targets.
our future growth increasingly depends on the growth and sustained profitability of certain international markets. some or all of our international market business units ("mbus"), which we generally define by the countries in which they operate, may not be successful in their operations or in achieving expected growth, which ultimately requires achieving consistent, stable net revenues and earnings. the performance of these international operations may be adversely affected by economic downturns in one or more of the countries in which our large mbus operate. a decline in performance of one or more of our significant international mbus could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results.
the cap segment is now one of our two significant profit centers driving our global returns, along with our americas segment. in particular, our china mbu contributes meaningfully to both consolidated and cap net revenues and earnings. china is currently our fastest growing market and second largest market overall. with our recent acquisition of the east china business, the china market is now 100% company owned and, along with the u.s. market. due to the significance of our china market for our profit and growth, we are exposed to risks in china, including the risks mentioned elsewhere below and the following:
•   the effects of current u.s.-china relations, including rounds of tariff increases and retaliations and increasing restrictive regulations, potential boycotts and increasing anti-americanism;
•   entry of new competitors to the specialty coffee market in china;
•   changes in economic conditions in china and potential negative effects to the growth of its middle class, wages, labor, inflation discretionary spending and real estate and supply chain costs;
•   ongoing government regulatory reform, including relating to food safety, tariffs and tax, bringing uncertainty and inconsistent interpretations, which may be contrary to ours, as well as potential significant increases in compliance costs;
•   the ability to successfully integrate the east china business.
additionally, some factors that will be critical to the success of our international operations overall are different than those affecting our u.s. stores and licensees. tastes naturally vary by region, and consumers in some mbus may not embrace our products to the same extent as consumers in the u.s. or other international markets. occupancy costs and store operating expenses can be higher internationally than in the u.s. due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance with country-specific regulatory requirements. because many of our international operations are in an early phase of development, operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to more developed operations, such as in the u.s. additionally, our international joint venture partners or licensees may face capital constraints or other factors that may limit the speed at which they are able to expand and develop in a certain market.
our international operations are also subject to additional inherent risks of conducting business abroad, such as:
•   foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, or requirements to transact in specific currencies;
•   changes or uncertainties in economic, legal, regulatory, social and political conditions in our markets, as well as negative effects on u.s. businesses due to increasing anti-american sentiment in certain markets;
•   interpretation and application of laws and regulations, including tax, tariffs, labor, merchandise, anti-bribery and privacy laws and regulations;
•   uncertainties and effects of the implementation of the united kingdom's referendum to withdraw membership from the european union (refer to as "brexit"), including financial, legal, tax and trade implications;
•   restrictive actions of foreign or u.s. governmental authorities affecting trade and foreign investment, especially during periods of heightened tension between the u.s. and such foreign governmental authorities, including protective measures such as export and customs duties and tariffs, government intervention favoring local competitors, and restrictions on the level of foreign ownership;
•   import or other business licensing requirements;
•   the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights;
•   limitations on the repatriation of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions due to current or new u.s. and international regulations;
•   in developing economies, the growth rate in the portion of the population achieving sufficient levels of disposable income may not be as fast as we forecast;
•   difficulty in staffing, developing and managing foreign operations and supply chain logistics, including ensuring the consistency of product quality and service, due to governmental actions affecting supply chain logistics, distance, language and cultural differences, as well as challenges in recruiting and retaining high quality employees in local markets;
•   local laws that make it more expensive and complex to negotiate with, retain or terminate employees;
•   delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control, competition with locally relevant competitors or a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates, any of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets and, in turn, negatively impact net revenues, operating income and earnings per share; and
•   disruption in energy supplies affecting our markets.
moreover, many of the foregoing risks are particularly acute in developing countries, which are important to our long-term growth prospects.
•   increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities or decreases in the availability of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.
we purchase, roast and sell high-quality whole bean arabica coffee beans and related coffee products. the price of coffee is subject to significant volatility and has and may again increase significantly due to one or more of the factors described below. the high-quality arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the "c" price. this premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly. increases in the "c" coffee commodity price do increase the price of high-quality arabica coffee and also impact our ability to enter into fixed-price purchase commitments. we frequently enter into supply contracts whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period, and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore price, at which the base "c" coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established. these are known as price-to-be-fixed contracts. the supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, such as weather (including the potential effects of climate change), natural disasters, crop disease, general increase in farm inputs and costs of production, inventory levels and political and economic conditions, as well as the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies. speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices. because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations, combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities, increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. in addition, if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or to a worldwide or regional shortage, we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee, which could have a material adverse impact on our profitability.
we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products, particularly fluid milk, to support the needs of our company-operated retail stores. additionally, and although less significant to our operations than coffee or dairy, other commodities, including but not limited to tea and those related to food and beverage inputs, such as cocoa, produce, baking ingredients, meats, eggs and energy, as well as the processing of these inputs, are important to our operations. increases in the cost of dairy products and other commodities, or lack of availability, whether due to supply shortages, delays or interruptions in processing, or otherwise, especially in international markets, could have a material adverse impact on our profitability.
•   our financial condition and results of operations are sensitive to, and may be adversely affected by, a number of factors, many of which are largely outside our control.
our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to a number of factors, many of which are largely outside our control. any one or more of the factors listed below or described elsewhere in this risk factors section could have a material adverse impact our business, financial condition and/or results of operations:
•   increases in real estate costs in certain domestic and international markets;
•   adverse outcomes of litigation;
•   severe weather or other natural or man-made disasters affecting a large market or several closely located markets that may temporarily but significantly affect our retail business in such markets; and
•   especially in our larger or fast growing markets, labor discord or disruption, geopolitical events, war, terrorism (including incidents targeting us), political instability, boycotts, increasing anti-american sentiment in certain markets, social unrest, and natural disasters, including health pandemics that lead to avoidance of public places or restrictions on public gatherings such as in our stores.
•   interruption of our supply chain could affect our ability to produce or deliver our products and could negatively impact our business and profitability.
any material interruption in our supply chain, such as material interruption of roasted coffee supply due to the casualty loss of any of our roasting plants, interruptions in service by our third party logistic service providers or common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels, trade restrictions, such as increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes or customs restrictions, natural disasters or political disputes and military conflicts that cause a material disruption in our supply chain could have a negative material impact on our business and our profitability.
additionally, our food, beverage and other products are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply chain operations, and in certain cases are produced or sourced by our licensees directly. we rely on these suppliers to provide high quality products and to comply with applicable laws. our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the u.s., especially countries or regions with diminished infrastructure, developing or failing economies or experiencing political instability or social unrest, and as we increase our fresh and prepared food offerings. for certain products, we may rely on one or very few suppliers. a supplier's failure to meet our standards, provide products in a timely and efficient manner, or comply with applicable laws is beyond our control. these issues, especially for those products for which we rely on one or few suppliers, could have a material negative impact on our business and profitability.
•   failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance and fluctuations in the stock market as a whole will likely adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.
failure to meet market expectations going forward, particularly with respect to operating margins, earnings per share, comparable store sales, operating cash flows, shareholder returns and net revenues, will likely result in a decline and/or increased volatility in the market price of our stock. in addition, price and volume fluctuations in the stock market as a whole may affect the market price of our stock in ways that may be unrelated to our financial performance.
•   the loss of key personnel or difficulties recruiting and retaining qualified personnel could adversely impact our business and financial results.
much of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of senior management personnel. the loss of any of our executive officers or other key senior management personnel could harm our business. we must continue to recruit, retain and motivate management and other employees sufficiently, both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives, some of which involve ongoing expansion in business channels outside of our traditional company-operated store model. our success also depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our retail store employees whom we rely on to give customers a superior in-store experience and elevate our brand. accordingly, our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain high quality employees to work in and manage our stores, both domestically and internationally. our ability to attract and retain both corporate and retail personnel is also acutely impacted in certain international and domestic markets where the competition for a relatively small number of qualified employees is intense or in markets where large high-tech companies are able to offer more competitive salaries and benefits, as well as where there is a strong economy with many available jobs and intense competition for the available workforce. additionally, there is intense competition for qualified technology systems developers necessary to develop and implement new technologies for our growth initiatives, including increasing our digital relationships with customers. if we are unable to recruit, retain and motivate employees sufficiently to maintain our current business and support our projected growth, our business and financial performance may be adversely affected.

item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general our fiscal year ends on the sunday closest to september 30. the fiscal years ended on september 30, 2018 and october 1, 2017 included 52 weeks. the fiscal year ended on october 2, 2016 included 53 weeks, with the extra week falling in our fourth fiscal quarter. comparable store sales percentages for fiscal 2016 are calculated excluding the 53rd week. all references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of related store closures, unless otherwise noted.
financial highlights
•   consolidated operating income decreased to $3.9 billion in fiscal 2018 compared to operating income of $4.1 billion in fiscal 2017. fiscal 2018 operating margin was 15.7% compared to 18.5% in fiscal 2017. operating margin compression in fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by food and beverage-related mix shifts, largely in the americas segment, the impact of our ownership change in east china at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2018, higher restructuring and impairment costs and higher salaries and benefits related to digital platforms, technology infrastructure and innovations.
•   restructuring and impairment charges increased to $224 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $154 million in fiscal 2017. increased costs were primarily related to higher asset impairments associated with the decision to close certain starbucks® company-operated stores in the u.s. and canada, higher goodwill impairment charges related to our switzerland retail reporting unit and emea restructuring costs.
•   earnings per share ("eps") for fiscal 2018 increased to $3.24, compared to eps of $1.97 in fiscal 2017. the increase was primarily driven by the gains from the acquisition of our east china joint venture and the sale of our tazo brand. additionally, the net favorable impact from the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act") also contributed to the increase.
•   cash flows from operations were $11.9 billion in fiscal 2018 compared to $4.3 billion in fiscal 2017. the change was primarily due to receipt of the upfront payment from nestlé related to the global coffee alliance.
•   capital expenditures were $2.0 billion in fiscal 2018 compared to $1.5 billion in fiscal 2017.
overview starbucks results for fiscal 2018 reflect the impact of certain restructuring and streamlining efforts, beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, to focus on accelerating growth in high-returning businesses and removing non-core, slow growth activities. these efforts primarily include the acquisition of our east china joint venture, the conversion of our singapore, taiwan and brazil operations to licensed models, the closure of teavanatm/mc retail stores, the sale of the tazo brand, the licensing of our cpg and foodservice businesses to nestlé, and the closure of certain company-operated stores in the u.s. and canada, among other actions. these streamlining efforts span across all segments and our corporate functions.
on august 26, 2018, our channel development segment finalized licensing and distribution agreements with nestlé to sell and market our cpg and foodservice products. the scope of the arrangement converts the majority of our previously defined channel development segment operations, as well as certain smaller businesses previously reported in the americas, emea and corporate and other (previously all other segment), from company-owned to licensed operations with nestlé. as a result, we realigned our organizational and operating segment structures in support of the newly established global coffee alliance. our reportable segments have been restated as if those smaller businesses were previously within our channel development segment.
concurrent with the change in reportable operating segments, we revised our prior period financial information to reflect comparable financial information for the new segment structure. further, in an effort to report operating expenses in line with the corresponding revenue generating activities, we have changed the classification of certain costs, primarily within our cap segment and mainly from other operating expenses to general and administrative expenses. this reclassification has been retrospectively applied and was determined to be immaterial.
starbucks largest acquisition to date affects our cap segment. as a result of acquiring the remaining interest in our east china joint venture at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we began recording 100% of its revenues and expenses on our consolidated statements of earnings at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2018. this is in contrast with our previous joint venture model, where we recorded only revenues and expenses from products sales to and royalties received from east china, as well as our proportionate share of the joint venture's net profit. the change from equity method to consolidation method lowered the operating margin of our consolidated and cap segment, primarily due to incremental depreciation and amortization expenses and lower income from equity investees.
starbucks results for fiscal 2018 continued to demonstrate the strength of our global business model and our ability to successfully make disciplined investments in our business and our partners. consolidated total net revenues increased 10% to $24.7 billion, primarily driven by incremental revenues from 1,997 net new store openings over the past 12 months, incremental revenues from the impact of our ownership change in east china, 2% growth in global comparable store sales and favorable foreign currency translation. these increases were partially offset by the absence of revenue related to the closure of our teavanatm/mc retail stores, initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and substantially ceased during fiscal 2018 and the sale of our singapore retail operations to a licensed partner in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. consolidated operating income declined $251 million, or 6%, to $3.9 billion. operating margin declined 280 basis points to 15.7%, primarily due to food and beverage-related mix shifts, largely in the americas segment, the impact of our ownership change in east china, higher restructuring and impairment costs and higher salaries and benefits related to digital platforms, technology infrastructure and innovations. earnings per share of $3.24 increased 64% over the prior year earnings per share of $1.97.
americas revenue grew by 7% to $16.7 billion, primarily driven by incremental revenues from 895 net new store openings over the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 2%, partially offset by the absence of revenue related to the conversion of our brazil retail business to fully licensed operations in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. operating income declined $39 million to $3.6 billion and operating margin of 21.6% declined 180 basis points from a year ago, primarily due to food and beverage-related mix shifts, increased investments in our store partners and the impact of the may 29th anti-bias training. these increases were partially offset by sales leverage.
in our cap segment, revenue grew by 38% to $4.5 billion, primarily driven by the impact of our ownership change in east china at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2018, incremental revenues from 756 net new stores over the past 12 months. these increases were partially offset by the absence of revenue related to the sale of our singapore retail operations to fully licensed operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. operating income grew 13% to $867 million, while operating margin declined 420 basis points to 19.4%, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in east china. we now operate 8,530 stores in 15 markets in our cap segment making this our second largest reportable segment.
in our emea segment, revenue grew by 9% to $1.0 billion, primarily driven by increased revenues from the opening of 356 net new licensed stores over the past 12 months and favorable foreign currency translation. operating margin declined 400 basis points to 5.9% primarily due to higher impairment of goodwill related to our switzerland retail business and restructuring costs, including severance, asset impairments and business process optimization expenses. these decreases were partially offset by lapping of a prior year tax settlement.
channel development segment revenues grew by 2% to $2.3 billion, primarily driven by increased sales of packaged coffee and premium single-serve products, lapping a prior year revenue deduction adjustment and favorable foreign currency translation. these increases were partially offset by the net impact from the sale of our tazo brand in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and licensing our cpg and foodservice businesses to nestlé beginning on august 26, 2018. operating income declined $40 million, or 4%, to $927 million. operating margin declined 250 basis points to 40.4%, primarily driven by business taxes associated with the upfront payment received from nestlé, global coffee alliance headcount related costs, including employee bonus and retention costs, and the impact of our ownership changes, including licensing our cpg and foodservice businesses to nestlé and the sale of our tazo brand.
fiscal 2019 - the view ahead turning to fiscal 2019, we expect continued growth through thoughtful long-term investments that create value and reward shareholders. these results are expected to be driven by our three strategic priorities, which include:
•   accelerate growth in our targeted, long-term growth markets of the u.s. and china
•   expand the global reach of the starbucks brand leveraging the global coffee alliance
•   sharpen our focus on increasing shareholder returns to successfully achieve these priorities, we will undertake a number of initiatives, including growing our core business in the u.s. through enhancement of the in-store experience, delivery of customer-relevant beverage innovation and digital relationships, and growing our business in china through new store expansion, comparable store sales and business partnerships. further, we will continue expanding the reach of the starbucks brand through retail market realignment, including our plans to license the france, netherlands, belgium and luxembourg markets, business simplification and the global coffee alliance. these additional streamlining initiatives will enable us to amplify our focus and resources on core value drivers with the greatest prospect for returns.
we expect moderate revenue growth in fiscal 2019, reflecting implementation of our streamlining activities and driven by comparable store sales growth and the opening of approximately 2,100 net new stores globally.
consolidated operating margin is expected to decrease slightly in fiscal 2019 when compared to fiscal 2018, and our effective tax rate is expected to increase slightly from fiscal 2018. while gaap full-year diluted earnings per share is expected to decrease in fiscal 2019, full-year non-gaap diluted earnings per share is expected to grow when excluding gains from acquisitions and divestitures in fiscal 2018, integration costs related to east china and japan and restructuring and impairment expenses.
capital expenditures in fiscal 2019 are expected to be approximately $2.0 billion, primarily related to our retail portfolio including investments in our new and existing stores and strategic store-related initiatives.
acquisitions and divestitures see note 2, acquisitions, divestitures and strategic alliance, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k for information regarding acquisitions and divestitures.
results of operations - fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017
consolidated results of operations (in millions):
revenues fiscal year ended                  sep 30,             oct 1,           %change total net revenues increased $2.3 billion, or 10%, over fiscal 2017, primarily driven by increased revenues from company-operated stores ($2.0 billion). the growth in company-operated store revenues was driven by incremental revenues from 816 net new starbucks® company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($904 million), incremental revenues from the impact of our ownership change in east china ($903 million) and a 2% increase in comparable store sales ($345 million), attributable to a 3% increase in average ticket.
licensed store revenue growth also contributed to the increase in total net revenues ($297 million), primarily due to increased product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($298 million), largely due to the opening of 1,181 net new starbucks® licensed stores over the past 12 months, the conversions of both the singapore and taiwan markets to fully licensed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and the first quarter of fiscal 2018, respectively ($44 million). these increases were partially offset by the impact of our ownership change in east china at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2018 ($53 million).
other revenues decreased $4 million, primarily driven by the absence of revenue from the sale of our tazo brand in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 ($56 million), the closure of our e-commerce business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 ($51 million) and licensing our cpg and foodservice businesses to nestlé late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 ($50 million). partially offsetting these decreases were increased sales of packaged coffee and premium single-serve products ($115 million).

depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 50 basis points, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in east china (approximately 60 basis points).
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 60 basis points, primarily due to higher salaries and benefits related to digital platforms, technology infrastructure and innovations (approximately 20 basis points) and the 2018 u.s. stock award (approximately 20 basis points).
restructuring and impairment expenses increased $71 million, primarily due to higher asset impairments associated with the decision to close certain company-operated stores in the u.s. and canada ($23 million), higher goodwill impairment charges associated with our switzerland company-operated retail reporting unit ($20 million) and emea restructuring costs, including severance and asset impairments ($18 million).
income from equity investees decreased $90 million, primarily due to the impact of ownership changes in our east china and taiwan joint ventures, partially offset by higher south korea joint venture income.
the combination of these changes resulted in an overall decrease in operating margin of 280 basis points in fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017.

gain resulting from acquisition of joint venture was due to remeasuring our preexisting 50% ownership interest in our east china joint venture to fair value upon acquisition.
net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations primarily consists of sales of our tazo brand and taiwan joint venture, partially offset by the net loss from the sale of our brazil retail operations in fiscal 2018. the gain in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to the sale of our singapore retail operations.
interest income and other, net increased $10 million, primarily due to recognizing higher income on unredeemed stored value card balances, partially offset by lapping the gain on the sale of our investment in square, inc. warrants in the prior year period.
the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was 21.8% compared to 33.2% for fiscal 2017. the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the gain on the purchase of our east china joint venture that is not subject to income tax (approximately 580 basis points) and the tax act (approximately 480 basis points). the impact from the tax act primarily included favorability from the lower corporate income tax rate applied to our fiscal 2018 results (approximately 760 basis points) and the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities (approximately 130 basis points). this favorability was partially offset by the estimated transition tax on our accumulated undistributed foreign earnings (approximately 400 basis points). see note 13, income taxes, for further discussion.

discussion of our china/asia pacific segment results below reflects the impact of fully consolidating our east china business due to the ownership change from an equity method joint venture to a company-operated market since the acquisition date of december 31, 2017. under the joint venture model, we recognized royalties and product sales within revenue and related product cost of sales as well as our proportionate share of east china's net earnings, which we recognized within income from equity investees. this resulted in a higher operating margin. under the company-operated ownership model, east china's operating results are reflected in most income statement lines of this segment.
revenues china/asia pacific total net revenues for fiscal 2018 increased $1.2 billion, or 38%, over fiscal 2017, primarily driven by higher company-operated store revenues ($1.2 billion) due to the impact of our ownership change in east china ($903 million) and incremental revenues from 443 net new company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($300 million). also contributing were favorable foreign currency translation ($82 million) and a 1% increase in comparable store sales ($26 million). partially offsetting these increases was the conversion of our singapore retail business to fully licensed operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 ($121 million).
licensed store revenues increased $38 million, primarily driven by increased product sales to and royalty revenues from licensees ($44 million), primarily resulting from the opening of 313 net new licensed stores over the past 12 months, the conversion of our taiwan joint venture to fully licensed operations at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2018 ($25 million) and the conversion of our singapore retail operations to fully licensed operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 ($20 million). these increases were partially offset by the absence of revenue from our ownership change in east china ($53 million).
operating expenses cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 70 basis points, primarily due to the ownership change in east china (approximately 60 basis points).
store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 40 basis points. as a percentage of company-operated store revenues, store operating expenses decreased 110 basis points, primarily due to the ownership change in east china (approximately 90 basis points).
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased 100 basis points, primarily due to sales leverage on salaries and benefits (approximately 50 basis points) and the impact of ownership change in east china (approximately 30 basis points).
income from equity investees decreased $80 million, primarily due to the impact of our ownership changes in east china and taiwan joint ventures, partially offset by higher south korea joint venture income.
the combination of these changes resulted in an overall decrease in operating margin of 420 basis points in fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017.

discussion of our channel development segment results reflect the impact of the licensing of our cpg and foodservice businesses to nestlé, the sale of tazo and an immaterial, unfavorable revenue deduction adjustment recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we licensed our cpg (starbucks-, starbucks reserve-, teavana-, seattle's best coffee-, starbucks via- and torrefazione italia-branded packaged coffee and tea) and foodservice businesses to nestlé and formed a global coffee alliance. eleven months of fiscal 2018 results reflect our cpg and foodservice businesses as company-owned and one month as licensed operations. our collaborative business relationships for our global ready-to-drink products and the associated revenues remain unchanged due to the global coffee alliance.
revenues channel development net revenues for fiscal 2018 increased $41 million, or 2%, over fiscal 2017. revenue growth was driven by an increase in sales of our packaged coffee and premium single-serve products ($115 million), lapping a prior year revenue deduction adjustment ($13 million) and favorable foreign currency translation ($10 million). these increases were partially offset by the absence of revenue from the sale of our tazo brand in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 ($56 million) and licensing our cpg and foodservice businesses to nestlé late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 ($50 million).
operating expenses cost of sales as a percentage of total net revenues increased 90 basis points, primarily driven by the impact of licensing our cpg and foodservice businesses to nestlé and the sale of our tazo brand (approximately 120 basis points), partially offset by lapping a revenue deduction adjustment recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 (approximately 30 basis points).
other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 100 basis points, primarily driven by business taxes associated with the upfront payment received from nestlé (approximately 120 basis points) and global coffee alliance headcount-related costs, including employee bonus and retention costs (approximately 80 basis points). these increases were partially offset by the cost savings related to our ownership changes, including licensing our cpg and foodservice businesses to nestlé and the sale of our tazo brand (approximately 40 basis points), and lower marketing expenses (approximately 40 basis points).
income from equity investees decreased $11 million for fiscal 2018, due to lower income from our north american coffee partnership joint venture, driven by decreased sales of frappuccino®, starbucks doubleshot® and iced coffee beverages.
the combination of these changes contributed to an overall decrease in operating margin of 250 basis points in fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017.

consolidated results of operations (in millions):
2017                    2016          change total net revenues increased $1.1 billion, or 5%, over fiscal 2016, primarily driven by increased revenues from company operated stores ($807 million). the growth in company-operated store revenues was primarily driven by incremental revenues from 768 net new starbucks® company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($869 million) and a 3% increase in comparable store sales ($496 million), attributable to a 3% increase in average ticket. partially offsetting these incremental revenues was the absence of the 53rd week ($324 million), the absence of sales from the conversion of certain company operated stores to licensed stores ($121 million) and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation ($70 million).
licensed store revenue growth also contributed to the increase in total net revenue ($201 million), primarily due to increased product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($260 million), largely due to the opening of 1,552 net new starbucks® licensed stores and improved comparable store sales, partially offset by the absence of the 53rd week ($41 million) and unfavorable foreign currency translation ($27 million).
other revenues increased $64 million, primarily driven by increased sales of packaged coffee, tea and premium single-serve products ($73 million), our ready-to-drink beverages ($21 million) and higher foodservice sales ($26 million). increased sales were partially offset by the absence of the 53rd week ($47 million) and an unfavorable revenue deduction adjustment pertaining to periods prior to 2017 ($13 million).

restructuring and impairments charges in fiscal 2017 were primarily the result of our strategic changes in teavana. we recorded $130 million of restructuring-related costs, including a partial goodwill impairment charge of $69 million, store asset impairments, and costs related to early store closure obligations and severance. additionally, we recorded $18 million of partial goodwill impairment relating to our switzerland retail business.
income from equity investees increased $73 million, due to higher income from our cap joint venture operations, primarily china and south korea, as well as our north american coffee partnership.

net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations increased $88 million, primarily due to the gain from the sale of our singapore retail operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 ($84 million).
interest expense increased $11 million primarily related to additional interest incurred on long-term debt issued in february 2016, may 2016 and march 2017, partially offset by lower interest expense from the repayment of our december 2016 notes.
the effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 33.2% compared to 32.9% for fiscal 2016. the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to unfavorability from non-deductible goodwill impairment charges recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 (approximately 70 basis points) and the lapping of the release of certain tax reserves in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, primarily related to statute closures (approximately 30 basis points). the increase was partially offset by the largely non-taxable gain on the sale of our singapore retail operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 (approximately 70 basis points).

revenues china/asia pacific total net revenues for fiscal 2017 increased $301 million, or 10%, over fiscal 2016, primarily from higher company-operated store revenues ($266 million), driven by incremental revenues from 392 net new company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($293 million). also contributing was a 3% increase in comparable store sales ($67 million), partially offset by the absence of the 53rd week ($52 million) and unfavorable foreign currency translation ($40 million).
licensed store revenues increased $35 million, primarily driven by increased product sales to and royalty revenues from licensees ($39 million), primarily resulting from the opening of 644 net new licensed stores over the past 12 months, partially offset the absence of the 53rd week ($4 million).
operating expenses cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 110 basis points, primarily driven by favorability from the transition to china's new value added tax structure (approximately 120 basis points).
store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 40 basis points. as a percentage of company-operated store revenues, store operating expenses decreased 40 basis points, primarily due to sales leverage on salaries and benefits (approximately 30 basis points) and lower performance-based compensation in japan (approximately 10 basis points).
other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 10 basis points. excluding the impact of company operated store revenues, other operating expenses decreased 180 basis points, primarily due to lower performance-based compensation (approximately 100 basis points) and timing of certain reimbursable expenses (approximately 90 basis points).
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased 50 basis points, primarily due to continued focus and investment in product quality and innovation (approximately 20 basis points) and higher salaries and benefits (approximately 20 basis points).
income from equity investees increased $47 million, driven by higher income from our joint venture operations, primarily in east china and south korea. favorability in both regions was attributable to comparable store sales growth and the addition of net new licensed stores over the past 12 months. east china also benefited from the new value added tax structure.
the combination of these changes resulted in an overall increase in operating margin of 210 basis points in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016.

revenues emea total net revenues for fiscal 2017 decreased $113 million, or 11%, over fiscal 2016. the decrease was primarily due to a decline in company-operated store revenues ($181 million), driven by the shift to more licensed stores in the region ($121 million), which includes the absence of revenues related to the sale of our germany retail operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. also contributing to the decline was unfavorable foreign currency translation ($43 million) and the absence of the 53rd week ($11 million).
licensed store revenues increased $68 million, driven by higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($95 million), resulting from the opening of 339 net new licensed stores and the transfer of 14 company-operated stores to licensed stores over the past 12 months. these increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation ($24 million) and the absence of the 53rd week ($6 million).
operating expenses cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues increased 260 basis points, primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency transactions (approximately 150 basis points) and the shift in the composition of our store portfolio to more licensed stores, which have a lower gross margin (approximately 100 basis points).
store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 200 basis points. as a percentage of company-operated store revenues, store operating expenses increased 330 basis points, primarily due to sales deleverage in certain company-operated stores (approximately 320 basis points) and the impact of a tax settlement (approximately 100 basis points), partially offset by the shift in the portfolio towards more licensed stores (approximately 140 basis points).
other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 80 basis points. excluding the impact of company operated store revenues, other operating expenses decreased 200 basis points, primarily due to sales leverage driven by the shift to more licensed stores (approximately 160 basis points).
depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 50 basis points, primarily due to the shift in portfolio towards more licensed stores (approximately 50 basis points).
restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal 2017 relate to a partial goodwill impairment expense recorded in our switzerland company-operated retail reporting unit, which we fully acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. the overall economic backdrop in europe, coupled with the strengthening of the swiss franc when compared to the relatively inexpensive euro in surrounding countries, caused ongoing unfavorable changes in consumer behavior and depressed tourism. our latest mitigation efforts for our switzerland retail business are not expected to fully recover the reporting unit's carrying value given the sustained nature of these and other external factors. as a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $18 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.
the combination of these changes resulted in an overall decrease in operating margin of 230 basis points in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016.

discussion of our channel development segment results reflects the impact of an unfavorable revenue deduction adjustment recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. while this adjustment was immaterial, the discussion below quantifies the impact to provide a better understanding of our results for fiscal 2017.
revenues channel development total net revenues for fiscal 2017 increased $62 million, or 3%, over fiscal 2016. revenue growth was driven by increased sales of packaged coffee, tea and premium single-serve products ($73 million), our ready-to-drink beverages ($21 million) and higher foodservice sales ($26 million). higher foodservice sales were primarily the result of a change to a direct distribution model and recognizing the benefit of full revenue from premium single-serve product sales. increased sales were partially offset by the absence of the 53rd week ($45 million) and an unfavorable revenue deduction adjustment pertaining to prior periods ($13 million).
operating expenses cost of sales as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 70 basis points, primarily driven by lower coffee costs (approximately 80 basis points) and leverage on cost of sales (approximately 60 basis points), partially offset by a shift toward lower margin products (approximately 80 basis points) and the revenue deduction adjustment pertaining to prior periods (approximately 30 basis points).
other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 80 basis points, primarily driven by lower performance-based compensation (approximately 40 basis points).
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 30 basis points, primarily driven by lower performance-based compensation (approximately 20 basis points) and salaries and benefits (approximately 10 basis points).
income from equity investees increased $28 million for fiscal 2017, due to higher income from our north american coffee partnership joint venture, driven by increased sales of frappuccino® and starbucks doubleshot® beverages as well as new product launches over the past 12 months.
the combination of these changes contributed to an overall increase in operating margin of 290 basis points in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016.

corporate and other includes the results of our teavana, siren retail, evolution fresh and our unallocated corporate expenses. unallocated corporate expenses include corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments.
the increase in the operating loss in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to restructuring and impairment charges related to our strategy to close teavanatm/mc retail stores and focus on teavanatm/mc tea within starbucks® stores. we recorded $69 million for the partial impairment of goodwill and $60 million in restructuring-related costs, including asset impairments, costs associated with the early closure of stores and their related obligations, and severance.
financial condition, liquidity and capital resources cash and investment overview our cash and investments were $9.2 billion and $3.2 billion as of september 30, 2018 and october 1, 2017, respectively with the increase driven primarily by the upfront payment associated with the global coffee alliance. we actively manage our cash and investments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, make acquisitions, and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases. our investment portfolio primarily includes highly liquid available-for-sale securities, including corporate debt securities, government treasury securities (domestic and foreign), mortgage and asset-backed securities, commercial paper, and agency obligations. as of september 30, 2018, approximately $1.3 billion of cash was held in foreign subsidiaries.
borrowing capacity our $2.0 billion unsecured 5-year revolving credit facility (the "2018 credit facility") and our $1.0 billion unsecured 364-day credit facility (the "364-day credit facility") are available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases.
the 2018 credit facility, of which $150 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is currently set to mature on october 25, 2022. we have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $500 million. borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on libor, and, for u.s. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a base rate (as defined in the credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. the applicable margin is based on the better of (i) the company's long-term credit ratings assigned by moody's and standard & poor's rating agencies and (ii) the company's fixed charge coverage ratio, pursuant to a pricing grid set forth in the five-year credit agreement. the current applicable margin is 0.680% for eurocurrency rate loans and 0.00% (nil) for base rate loans.
the 364-day credit facility, of which no amount may be used for issuances of letters of credit, was originally set to mature on october 25, 2018. in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the maturity has been extended to october 23, 2019. we have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $500 million. borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on libor, and, for u.s. dollar-
denominated loans under certain circumstances, a base rate (as defined in the credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. the applicable margin was increased from 0.585% to 0.92% for eurocurrency rate loans and 0.00% (nil) for base rate loans as a result of the extension.
both credit facilities contain provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which measures our ability to cover financing expenses. as of september 30, 2018, we were in compliance with all applicable credit facility covenants. no amounts were outstanding under our credit facility as of september 30, 2018.
under our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3 billion, with individual maturities that may vary but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are required to be backstopped by available commitments under our credit facilities discussed above. the proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program may be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, business expansion, payment of cash dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. as of september 30, 2018, we had no borrowings under our commercial paper program.
in august 2018, we issued long-term debt in an underwritten registered public offering, which consisted of $1.25 billion of 7-year 3.800% senior notes (the "2025 notes") due august 2025, $750 million of 10-year 4.000% senior notes (the "2028 notes") due november 2028 and $1 billion of 30-year 4.500% senior notes (the "2048 notes") due november 2048. interest on the 2025 notes is payable semi-annually on february 15 and august 15, commencing on february 15, 2019. interest on the 2028 and 2048 notes is payable semi-annually on may 15 and november 15, commencing on november 15, 2018.
in february 2018, we issued long-term debt in an underwritten registered public offering, which consisted of $1 billion of 5-year 3.100% senior notes (the "2023 notes") due march 2023 and $600 million of 10-year 3.500% senior notes (the "2028 notes") due march 2028. interest on the 2023 and 2028 notes is payable semi-annually on march 1 and september 1, commencing on september 1, 2018.
in november 2017, we issued long-term debt in an underwritten registered public offering, which consisted of $500 million of 3-year 2.200% senior notes (the "2020 notes") due november 2020 and $500 million of 30-year 3.750% senior notes (the "2047 notes") due december 2047. interest on the 2020 notes is payable semi-annually on may 22 and november 22, commencing on may 22, 2018 and interest on the 2047 notes is payable semi-annually on june 1 and december 1, commencing on june 1, 2018.
the net proceeds from these offerings are used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our common stock under our ongoing share repurchase program and payment of dividends.
see note 9, debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k for details of the components of our long-term debt.
the indentures under which all of our senior notes were issued require us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including limits on future liens and sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties. as of september 30, 2018, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants.
use of cash we expect to use our available cash and investments, including, but not limited to, additional potential future borrowings under the credit facilities, commercial paper program and the issuance of debt, to invest in our core businesses, including capital expenditures, new product innovations, related marketing support and partner and digital investments, return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases, as well as other new business opportunities related to our core and other developing businesses. further, we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our investees. we may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business in support of our growth agenda. acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our investees. any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy.
we believe that future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and investments both domestically and internationally combined with our ability to leverage our balance sheet through the issuance of debt will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses as well as any shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future. significant new joint ventures, acquisitions and/or other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding. we have borrowed funds and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates; however, additional borrowings would result in increased interest expense in the future. in this regard, we may incur additional debt, within targeted levels, as part of our plans to fund our capital programs, including cash returns to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
we have historically considered the majority of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and equity investees to be indefinitely reinvested, and, accordingly, no foreign withholding taxes have been provided on such earnings. we continue to evaluate our plans for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings and thus have not adjusted our previous indefinite reinvestment assertions for the effects of the tax act. we have not, nor do we anticipate the need for, repatriated funds to the u.s. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs. however, the tax act requires a one-time transition tax for deemed repatriation of accumulated undistributed earnings of certain foreign investments. this one-time transition tax is payable over eight years, with most of the cash outlay expected to be made in the later years. in connection with our initial analysis, we have estimated a provisional amount of $262 million, of which $237 million of income taxes payable was included in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet, as of september 30, 2018. see note 13, income taxes, for further discussion.
we regularly review our cash positions and our determination of permanent reinvestment of foreign earnings. in the event we determine that all or a portion of such foreign earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and u.s. state income taxes, beyond the tax act's one-time transition tax, which could be material.
during each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2017, we declared a cash dividend to shareholders of $0.25 per share. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and each of the first two quarters of fiscal 2018, we declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per share, and we declared $0.36 per share in the last two quarters of fiscal 2018. dividends are paid in the quarter following the declaration date. cash returned to shareholders through dividends in fiscal 2018 and 2017 totaled $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we declared a cash dividend of $0.36 per share to be paid on november 30, 2018 with an expected payout of approximately $445 million.
during fiscal years 2018 and 2017, we repurchased 131.5 million and 37.5 million shares of common stock, respectively, or $7.2 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, under our ongoing share repurchase program. in early fiscal 2019, we commenced the repurchase of $5.0 billion of our common stock under accelerated share repurchase agreements.
other than normal operating expenses, cash requirements for fiscal 2019 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for investments in our new and existing stores, our developing siren retail business and our supply chain and corporate facilities. total capital expenditures for fiscal 2019 are expected to be approximately $2 billion.
cash flows cash provided by operating activities was $11.9 billion for fiscal 2018, compared to $4.3 billion for fiscal 2017. the change was primarily due to receipt of the upfront payment from nestlé in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.
cash used by investing activities totaled $2.4 billion for fiscal 2018, compared to $0.9 billion for fiscal 2017. the change was primarily due to cash used to acquire the 50% ownership interest in our east china joint venture in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and additions to property, plant and equipment driven by new store openings and increased store renovations, partially offset by the net proceeds from the divestiture of certain operations.
cash used by financing activities for fiscal 2018 totaled $3.2 billion, compared to $3.1 billion for fiscal 2017. the change was primarily due to an increase in cash returned to shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments, partially offset by higher proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt.
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and borrowings as of september 30, 2018, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods (in millions):

(4)   other obligations include other long-term liabilities primarily consisting of the tax act transition tax, asset retirement obligations and hedging instruments.
starbucks currently expects to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business.
off-balance sheet arrangements off-balance sheet arrangements relate to operating lease and purchase commitments detailed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k.
commodity prices, availability and general risk conditions commodity price risk represents starbucks primary market risk, generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products, among other items. we purchase, roast and sell high-quality arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. in addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company-operated stores. the price and availability of these commodities directly impacts our results of operations, and we expect commodity prices, particularly coffee, to impact future results of operations. for additional details see product supply in item 1, as well as risk factors in item 1a of this 10-k.
financial risk management market risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices and interest rates. we manage our exposure to various market-based risks according to a market price risk management policy. under this policy, market-based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. the market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate risk. risk limits are set annually and prohibit speculative trading activity. we also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk, which we consider to be low. excluding interest rate swaps, hedging instruments generally do not have maturities in excess of three years. refer to note 1, summary of significant accounting policies, and note 3, derivative financial instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k for further discussion of our hedging instruments.
the sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited, point-in-time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed. the actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses.
commodity price risk we purchase commodity inputs, primarily coffee, dairy products, diesel, cocoa, sugar and other commodities, that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results. we use a combination of pricing features embedded within supply contracts, such as fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts for coffee purchases, and financial derivatives to manage our commodity price risk exposure.
the following table summarizes the potential impact as of september 30, 2018 to starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income ("oci") from changes in commodity prices. the information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items (in millions):

foreign currency exchange risk the majority of our revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in u.s. dollars. however, because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the u.s., we have transactions in other currencies, primarily the chinese renminbi, japanese yen, canadian dollar, british pound, south korean won and euro. to reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations, we enter into derivative instruments to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated intercompany royalty payments, inventory purchases, intercompany borrowing and lending activities and certain other transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity that enters into the arrangements, as well as the translation risk of certain balance sheet items. see note 3, derivative financial instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k for further discussion.
the following table summarizes the potential impact as of september 30, 2018 to starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due to a change in the value of the u.s. dollar as compared to foreign exchange rates. the information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items (in millions):

equity security price risk we have minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds and equity exchange-traded funds within our trading securities portfolio. trading securities are recorded at fair value and approximates a portion of our liability under our management deferred compensation plan ("mdcp"). gains and losses from the portfolio and the change in our mdcp liability are recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings.
we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of september 30, 2018 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.
interest rate risk long-term debt we utilize short-term and long-term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage our overall interest expense related to our existing fixed-rate debt, as well as to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances. see note 3, derivative financial instruments and note 9, debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k for further discussion of our interest rate hedge agreements and details of the components of our long-term debt, respectively, as of september 30, 2018.

available-for-sale securities our available-for-sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of investment-grade debt securities. the primary objective of these investments is to preserve capital and liquidity. available-for-sale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. we do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our available-for-sale securities. we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our available-for-sale securities as of september 30, 2018 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.
application of critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1, summary of significant accounting policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k. we believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity.
we consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. during the past five fiscal years, we have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies used to assess the areas discussed below, unless noted otherwise.
property, plant and equipment and other finite-lived assets we evaluate property, plant and equipment and other finite-lived assets for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. when evaluating for impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated future undiscounted cash flows. if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset's carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis and is depreciated over the asset's remaining useful life.
long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. for company-operated store assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level. the fair value of a store's assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. for other long-lived assets, fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances, which may include discounted cash flows, comparable transactions, or comparable company analyses.
our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values. key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values include projected revenue growth and operating expenses, as well as forecasting asset useful lives and selecting an appropriate discount rate. for company-operated stores, estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider the store's historical performance, the local market economics and the business environment impacting the store's performance. the discount rate is selected based on what we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store. these estimates are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets, changes in economic conditions, and changes in operating performance.
during fiscal 2018, there were no significant changes in any of our estimates or assumptions, aside from those related to the decision to close certain company-operated stores in the u.s. and canada, which had a material impact on the outcome of our impairment calculations. however, as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values, changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets we evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that impairment may exist. when evaluating these assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. if we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using discounted cash flows or a combination of discounted cash flow and market approaches.
when assessing goodwill for impairment, our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit in a given year is influenced by a number of factors, inclusive of the size of the reporting unit's goodwill, the significance of the excess of the reporting unit's estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date, the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments and the date of acquisition. if we perform a quantitative assessment of an individual reporting unit's goodwill, our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment when estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, including projected revenue growth and operating expenses related to existing businesses, product innovation and new store concepts, as well as utilizing valuation multiples of similar publicly traded companies and selecting an appropriate discount rate. estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering the reporting unit's past performance and forecasted growth, strategic initiatives, local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit's performance. the discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital for a market participant to operate the reporting unit in the region. these estimates, as well as the selection of comparable companies and valuation multiples used in the market approaches are highly subjective, and our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion.
when assessing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, where we perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate if changes in events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that impairment may exist. if we do not perform a qualitative impairment assessment or if changes in events and circumstances indicate that a quantitative assessment should be performed, management is required to calculate the fair value of the intangible asset group. the fair value calculation includes estimates of revenue growth, which are based on past performance and internal projections for the intangible asset group's forecasted growth, and royalty rates, which are adjusted for our particular facts and circumstances. the discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business. these estimates are highly subjective, and our ability to achieve the forecasted cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion.
the goodwill impairment charges related to the switzerland reporting unit are discussed in note 8, other intangible assets and goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k.
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. we routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized.
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of operations. in projecting future taxable income, we consider historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. our assumptions regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our underlying businesses. in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income/(loss).
in addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. these audits include review of our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions. we evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of our position. for uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. we adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available. as discussed in note 13, income taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k, there is a reasonable possibility that our unrecognized tax benefit liability will be adjusted within 12 months due to the expiration of a statute of limitations and/or resolution of examinations with taxing authorities.
we have generated income in certain foreign jurisdictions that may be subject to additional income or withholding taxes. we have historically asserted our intent to reinvest these earnings for the foreseeable future. the company continues to evaluate its plans for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings and thus has not adjusted its previous indefinite reinvestment assertions for the effects of the tax act. while we do not expect to repatriate cash to the u.s. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs, if these amounts were distributed to the u.s., in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to additional income or withholding taxes, which could be material.
our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances. although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected.

item 1a.   risk factors our business, financial condition and results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. in connection with any investment decision, you should carefully consider the following significant factors, which could materially affect us, including impacting our business, financial condition, results of operations, stock price or credit rating, as well as our reputation. you should read these risk factors in conjunction with "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" in item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item 8. these risks are not the only ones we face. we could also be affected by other events, factors or uncertainties that are unknown to us, or that we do not currently consider to be significant risks.
changes in general economic conditions, in the u.s. and internationally, may adversely affect us.
we conduct operations in over 220 countries and territories. our operations are subject to cyclicality affecting national and international economies in general, as well as the local economic environments in which we operate. the factors that result in general economic changes are beyond our control, and it may be difficult for us to adjust our business model to mitigate the impact of these factors. in particular, our business is affected by levels of industrial production, consumer spending and retail activity and we could be materially affected by adverse developments in these aspects of the economy. in addition, there remains substantial economic uncertainty arising from the united kingdom's decision to leave the european union. the u.k. and the e.u. continue to negotiate the future relationship between themselves, which could take several years to finalize. the outcome of these negotiations could result in, among other things, transportation delays, fewer goods being transported globally, additional volatility in currency exchange rates and further regulations relating to, among other things, trade, aviation and the transport of goods. any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect us.
our industry is rapidly evolving, including demand for faster deliveries and increased visibility into shipments. we expect continued significant competition on a local, regional, national and international basis. our competitors include the postal services of the u.s. and other nations, various motor carriers, express companies, freight forwarders, air couriers, large transportation and e-commerce companies that are making significant investments in their capabilities, and start ups and other companies that combine technologies with crowdsourcing to focus on local market needs, some of whom may currently be our customers. competition may also come from other sources in the future, including as new technologies are developed. competitors have cost and organizational structures that differ from ours and from time to time may offer services or pricing terms that we may not be willing or able to offer. additionally, to remain competitive, from time to time we may have to raise prices and our customers may not be willing to accept these higher prices. if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to competitive pressures, we could be adversely affected.
continued transportation industry consolidation may further increase competition. as a result of consolidation, competitors may increase their market share, improve their financial capacity and strengthen their competitive positions. business combinations could also result in competitors providing a wider variety of services and products at competitive prices, which could adversely affect us.
changes in our relationships with any of our significant customers, including the loss or reduction in business from one or more of them, could have a material adverse effect on us.
for the year ended december 31, 2019, one customer, amazon.com and its affiliates, accounted for 11.6% of our consolidated revenues. some of our other significant customers can account for a relatively significant portion of our revenues in a particular quarter or year. these customers can impact our revenues based on factors such as: customer product launches; e-commerce or other industry trends, such as the seasonality associated with the fourth quarter holiday season; business combinations and the overall growth of a customer's underlying business; as well as any disruptions to their businesses. these customers could choose to divert all or a portion of their business with us to one of our competitors, demand pricing concessions for our services, require us to provide enhanced services that increase our costs, or develop their own shipping and distribution capabilities. in addition, certain of our significant customer contracts include termination rights of either party upon the occurrence of certain events or without cause upon advance notice to the other party. if all or a portion of our business relationships with one or more significant customers were to terminate or be canceled it could materially adversely affect us.
our business is subject to complex and stringent laws, regulations and policies which could increase our operating costs.
we are subject to complex and stringent aviation, transportation, environmental, security, labor, employment, safety, privacy and data protection and other governmental laws, regulations and policies, both in the u.s. and in other countries in which we operate. in addition, we are impacted by laws, regulations and policies that affect global trade, including tariff and trade policies, export requirements, taxes, monetary policies and other restrictions and charges. recently, trade discussions between the u.s. and various of its trading partners have been fluid, and existing and future trade agreements are and are expected to continue to be subject to a number of uncertainties, including the imposition of new tariffs or adjustments and changes to the products covered by existing tariffs. the impact of new laws, regulations and policies or decisions or interpretations by authorities applying those laws and regulations, cannot be predicted. compliance with any new laws or regulations may increase our operating costs or require significant capital expenditures. any failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or policies in the u.s. or in any of the other countries in which we operate could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations, which could adversely affect us.
increased security requirements impose substantial costs on us and we could be the target of an attack or have a security breach, which could materially adversely affect us.
as a result of concerns about global terrorism and homeland security, governments around the world have adopted or may adopt stricter security requirements that will result in increased operating costs for businesses in the transportation industry. these requirements may change periodically as a result of regulatory and legislative requirements and in response to evolving threats. we cannot determine the effect that any new requirements will have on our cost structure or our operating results, and new rules or other future security requirements may increase our costs of operations and reduce operating efficiencies. regardless of our compliance with security requirements or the steps we take to secure our facilities or fleet, we could also be the target of an attack or security breaches could occur, which could materially adversely affect us.
increasingly stringent regulations related to climate change could materially increase our operating costs.
regulation of greenhouse gas ("ghg") emissions exposes our transportation and logistics businesses to potentially significant new taxes, fees and other costs. compliance with such regulation, and any increased or additional regulation, or the associated costs is further complicated by the fact that various countries and regions are following different approaches to the regulation of climate change.
for example, in 2009 the european commission approved the extension to the airline industry of the european union emissions trading scheme ("ets") for ghg emissions. under this decision, all of our flights operating within the european union are covered by the ets requirements, and we are required annually to purchase emission allowances in an amount exceeding the number of free allowances allocated to us under the ets. similarly, in 2016, the international civil aviation organization ("icao") passed a resolution adopting the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation ("corsia"), which is a global, market-based emissions offset program to encourage carbon-neutral growth beyond 2020. a pilot phase is scheduled to begin in 2021 in which countries may voluntarily participate, and full mandatory participation is scheduled to begin in 2027. icao continues to develop details regarding implementation, but compliance with corsia will increase our operating costs.
in the u.s., congress in the past several years has considered various bills that would regulate ghg emissions, but these bills so far have not received sufficient congressional support for enactment. nevertheless, some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future. even in the absence of such legislation, the environmental protection agency ("epa"), spurred by judicial interpretation of the clean air act, could determine to regulate ghg emissions, especially aircraft or diesel engine emissions, and this could impose substantial costs on us.
in november 2019, the u.s. began the process to withdraw from the paris climate accord, an agreement among 196 countries to reduce ghg emissions. the effect of that withdrawal on future u.s. policy regarding ghg emissions, on corsia and on other ghg regulation is uncertain. nevertheless, the extent to which other countries implement that agreement could have an adverse direct or indirect effect on us.
we may face additional regulations regarding ghg emissions internationally and in the united states. potential costs to us of increased regulation regarding ghg emissions, especially aircraft or diesel engine emissions, include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other energy we purchase and capital costs associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicles prematurely. we cannot predict the impact any future regulation would have on our cost structure or our operating results. it is possible that such regulation could significantly increase our operating costs and that we may not be willing or able to pass such costs along to our customers. moreover, even without such regulation, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the ghgs emitted by companies in the airline and transportation industries could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services, especially our air services.
many of our u.s. employees are employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the teamsters. our airline pilots, airline mechanics, ground mechanics and certain other employees are employed under other collective bargaining agreements. in addition, some of our international employees are employed under collective bargaining or similar agreements. strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns by our employees could adversely affect our ability to meet our customers' needs. as a result, customers may reduce their business or stop doing business with us if they believe that such actions or threatened actions may adversely affect our ability to provide services. we may face a permanent loss of customers if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service, and this could materially adversely affect us. the terms of future collective bargaining agreements also may affect our competitive position and results of operations.
we are exposed to the effects of changing fuel and energy prices, including gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, and interruptions in supplies of these commodities.
changing fuel and energy costs have a significant impact on our operations. we require significant quantities of fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicles and are exposed to the risks associated with variations in the market price for petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. we mitigate our exposure to changing fuel prices through our indexed fuel surcharges and through hedging transactions from time to time. if we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharges, higher fuel costs could adversely impact our operating results. even if we are able to offset changes in fuel costs with surcharges, high fuel surcharges may result in a mix shift from our higher-yielding air products to lower-yielding ground products or an overall reduction in volume. there can also be no assurance that hedging transactions will be effective to protect us from changes in fuel prices. moreover, we could experience a disruption in energy supplies as a result of war, actions by producers or other factors beyond our control, which could have a material adverse effect on us.
changes in exchange rates or interest rates may have a material adverse effect on us.
we conduct business across the globe with a significant portion of our revenue derived from operations outside the united states. our operations in international markets are affected by changes in the exchange rates for local currencies, and in particular the euro, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, chinese renminbi and hong kong dollar.
we are exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily on our short-term debt and that portion of our long-term debt that carries floating interest rates. the impact of a 100-basis-point change in interest rates affecting our debt is discussed in the "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" section of this report. additionally, changes in interest rates impact the valuation of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and the related benefit cost recognized in the income statement. the impact of changes in interest rates on our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and costs is discussed further in the "critical accounting policies and estimates" section of this report.
we monitor and manage our exposures to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates, and use derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of changes in these rates on our financial position and results of operations; however, changes in exchange rates and interest rates cannot always be predicted or hedged and may have a material adverse effect on us.
the proposed phase out of the london interbank offer rate ("libor") could have an adverse effect on us.
certain of our debt and other financial instruments have interest rates tied to libor. the head of the united kingdom financial conduct authority has announced the desire to phase out the use of libor by the end of 2021. there is currently no definitive information regarding the future utilization of libor or any particular replacement rate. as such, the potential effect of any such event on our cost of capital cannot be determined. in addition, any further changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of libor may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported libor, which could have an adverse impact on extensions of credit held by us and could have a material adverse effect on us.
failure to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation could adversely impact us.
our success depends in part on our ability to maintain the image of the ups brand and our reputation for providing excellent service to our customers. service quality issues, actual or perceived, even when false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of our brand and may cause customers to use other companies. also, adverse publicity surrounding labor relations, environmental concerns, security matters, political activities and similar matters, or attempts to connect our company to such issues, either in the united states or other countries in which we operate, could negatively affect our overall reputation and use of our services by customers. social media accelerates and amplifies the scope of negative publicity, and makes responding to negative claims more difficult. damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and thus have a material adverse effect on us, and could require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand.
a significant data breach or it system disruption could materially adversely affect us, including requiring us to increase spending on data and system security.
we rely heavily on information technology networks and systems, including the internet and a number of internally-developed systems and applications, to manage or support a wide variety of important business processes and activities throughout our operations. for example, we rely on information technology to receive package level information in advance of physical receipt of packages, to track items that move through our delivery systems, to efficiently plan deliveries, to execute billing processes, and to track and report financial and operational data. our franchised center locations and businesses we have acquired also are reliant on the use of information technology systems to manage their business processes and activities.
in addition, the provision of service to our customers and the operation of our networks and systems involve the collection, storage and transmission of significant amounts of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of customers, employees and others. to conduct our operations, we regularly move data across national borders, and consequently we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the united states and abroad regarding privacy, data protection and data security. the scope of the laws that may be applicable to us is often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly with respect to foreign laws. for example, the european union's general data protection regulation ("gdpr"), which greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of european union law and adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data, including the public disclosure of significant data breaches, became effective in may 2018. other countries have enacted or are enacting data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders. all of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time.
our information technology systems (as well as those of our franchisees and acquired businesses) are susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to programming errors, defects or other vulnerabilities, power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, ransomware attacks, malware attacks, theft, misconduct by employees or other insiders, telecommunications failures, misuse, human errors or other catastrophic events. hackers, foreign governments, cyber-terrorists and cyber-criminals, acting individually or in coordinated groups, may launch distributed denial of service attacks or other coordinated attacks that may cause service outages, gain inappropriate or block legitimate access to systems or information, or result in other interruptions in our business. in addition, the foregoing breaches in security could expose us, our customers and franchisees, or the individuals affected, to a risk of loss, disclosure or misuse of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of customers, employees and others. the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently, may be difficult to detect and often are not recognized until launched against a target. as a result, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate measures to prevent any of the events described above.
we also depend on and interact with the information technology networks and systems of third-parties for many aspects of our business operations, including our customers, and franchisees and service providers such as cloud service providers and third-party delivery services. these third parties may have access to information we maintain about our company, operations, customers, employees and vendors, or operating systems that are critical to or can significantly impact our business operations. like us, these third parties are subject to risks imposed by data breaches and it systems disruptions like those described above, and other events or actions that could damage, disrupt or close down their networks or systems. security processes, protocols and standards that we have implemented and contractual provisions requiring security measures that we may have sought to impose on such third-parties may not be sufficient or effective at preventing such events. these events could result in unauthorized access to, or disruptions or denials of access to, misuse or disclosure of, information or systems that are important to our business, including proprietary information, sensitive or confidential data, and other information about our operations, customers, employees and suppliers, including personal information.
any of these events that impact our information technology networks or systems, or those of acquired businesses, franchisees, customers, service providers or other third-parties, could result in disruptions in our operations, the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to our brand and reputation, regulatory scrutiny, and litigation and potential liability for us. among other consequences, our customers' confidence in our ability to protect data and systems and to provide services consistent with their expectations could be impacted, further disrupting our operations. similarly, an actual or alleged failure to comply with applicable u.s. or foreign data protection regulations or other data protection standards may expose us to litigation, fines, sanctions or other penalties.
we have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiatives, information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans. the cost and operational consequences of implementing, maintaining and enhancing further data or system protection measures could increase significantly to overcome increasingly intense, complex and sophisticated global cyber threats. despite our best efforts, we are not fully insulated from data breaches and system disruptions. although to date we are unaware of a data breach or system disruption, including a cyber-attack, that has been material to us, we cannot provide any assurances that such events and impacts will not be material in the future, and our efforts to deter, identify, mitigate and/or eliminate future breaches may require significant additional effort and expense and may not be successful.
severe weather conditions and other natural or manmade disasters, including storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, epidemics, pandemics, conflicts, unrest, or terrorist attacks, may disrupt our business and result in decreased revenues. customers may reduce shipments, or our costs to operate our business may increase, either of which could have a material adverse effect on us. any such event affecting one of our major facilities could result in a significant interruption in or disruption of our business.
we make significant capital investments in our business of which a significant portion is tied to projected volume levels.
we require significant capital investments in our business consisting of aircraft, vehicles, technology, facilities and sorting and other types of equipment. these investments support both our existing business and anticipated growth. forecasting projected volume involves many factors which are subject to uncertainty, such as general economic trends, changes in governmental regulation and competition. if we do not accurately forecast our future capital investment needs, we could have excess capacity or insufficient capacity, either of which would negatively affect our revenues and profitability. in addition to forecasting our capital investment requirements, we adjust other elements of our operations and cost structure in response to adverse economic conditions; however, these adjustments may not be sufficient to allow us to maintain our operating margins.
economic, political, social developments and other risks associated with international operations could adversely affect us.
we have significant international operations. as a result, we are continually exposed to changing economic, political and social developments that are beyond our control. emerging markets are typically more volatile than those in the developed world, and any broad-based downturn in these markets could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. we are subject to many laws governing our international operations, including those that prohibit improper payments to government officials and commercial customers, and restrict where we can do business, our shipments to certain countries and the information that we can provide to non-u.s. governments. our failure to manage and anticipate these and other risks associated with our international operations could materially adversely affect us.
we are subject to changes in markets and our business plans that have resulted, and may in the future result, in substantial write-downs of the carrying value of our assets, thereby reducing our net income.
our regular review of the carrying value of our assets has resulted, from time to time, in significant impairments, and we may in the future be required to recognize additional impairment charges. changes in business strategy, government regulations, or economic or market conditions have resulted and may result in further substantial impairments of our intangible, fixed or other assets at any time in the future. in addition, we have been and may be required in the future to recognize increased depreciation and amortization charges if we determine that the useful lives of our fixed assets or intangible assets are shorter than we originally estimated. such changes have in the past, and may in the future, reduce our net income.
employee health and retiree health and pension benefit costs represent a significant expense to us; further cost increases could materially and adversely affect us.
our expenses relating to employee health and retiree health and pension benefits are significant. in recent years, we have experienced significant increases in some of these costs, largely as a result of economic factors beyond our control, including, in particular, ongoing increases in healthcare costs well in excess of the rate of inflation and historically low discount rates that we use to value our benefit plan obligations. continually increasing healthcare costs, volatility in investment returns and discount rates, as well as changes in laws, regulations and assumptions used to calculate retiree health and pension benefit expenses, may adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or require significant contributions to our benefit plans. our national master agreement with the teamsters includes provisions that are designed to mitigate certain of these healthcare expenses, but there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful or that the failure or success of these efforts will not materially adversely affect us.
we participate in a number of trustee-managed multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements. as part of the overall collective bargaining process for wage and benefit levels, we have agreed to contribute certain amounts to the multiemployer benefit plans during the contract period. the multiemployer benefit plans set benefit levels and are responsible for benefit delivery to participants. future contribution amounts to multiemployer benefit plans will be determined only through collective bargaining, and we have no additional legal or constructive obligation to increase contributions beyond the agreed-upon amounts. however, in future collective bargaining negotiations, we could agree to make significantly higher future contributions to improve the funded status of one or more of these plans. the funded status of these multiemployer plans is impacted by various factors, including investment performance, healthcare inflation, changes in demographics and changes in participant benefit levels. at this time, we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions, if any, or whether any material adverse effect on us could result from our participation in these plans.
in addition to our on-going multiemployer pension plan obligations, we may have significant additional exposure with respect to benefits earned in the central states pension fund (the "cspf"). for additional information on our potential additional liabilities related to the cspf, see note 5 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.
we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and many foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. in the course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. for example, compliance with the 2017 united states tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act") may require the collection of information not regularly produced within our company and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. many aspects of the tax act remain unclear and may not be clarified for some time. in addition, many state jurisdictions continue to issue guidance on the state treatment of certain aspects of the tax act. as regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the tax act, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our tax rates and our financial position.
we are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes more difficult. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation in the jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. in addition, changes in u.s. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, and changes in taxing jurisdictions' administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions may materially adversely impact our tax expense and cash flows.
the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, property damage, business practices, environmental liability and other matters. any material litigation or a catastrophic accident or series of accidents could result in significant expenditures and have a material adverse effect on us.
our inability to effectively integrate acquired operations and realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic alliances could adversely affect us.
as part of our business strategy, we may acquire businesses and form joint ventures or strategic alliances. whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends, in part, upon the successful integration between the businesses involved, the performance of the underlying operations, capabilities or technologies and the management of the acquired operations. accordingly, our financial results could be materially adversely affected by our failure to effectively integrate the acquired operations, unanticipated performance issues or transaction-related charges.
we have a combination of both self-insurance and high-deductible insurance programs for the risks arising out of the services we provide and the nature of our global operations, including claims exposure resulting from cargo loss, personal injury, property damage, aircraft and related liabilities, business interruption and workers' compensation. workers' compensation, automobile and general liabilities are determined using actuarial estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred and an estimate of incurred but not reported claims, on an undiscounted basis. our accruals for insurance reserves reflect certain actuarial assumptions and management judgments, which are subject to a high degree of variability. if the number or severity of claims for which we are retaining risk increases, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. if we lose our ability to self-insure these risks, our insurance costs could materially increase and we may find it difficult to obtain adequate levels of insurance coverage.

•   average daily package volume increased 5.8% primarily driven by our u.s. domestic package segment, which experienced growth from smbs as well as several large customers, led by our largest customer, amazon.
•   average revenue per piece is dependent upon base rates, customer and product mix, average billable weight per piece, fuel surcharge rates and currency. average revenue per piece decreased as a result of changes in customer and product mix, and lower average billable weight per piece in our u.s. domestic package segment. currency movements negatively impacted revenue per piece in our international package segment.
•   operating profit and operating margin increased with growth and margin expansion in all segments.
•   we reported net income of $4.440 billion and diluted earnings per share of $5.11. adjusted diluted earnings per share was $7.53 after adjusting for the after-tax impacts of the following:
◦transformation strategy costs of $196 million;
◦legal contingencies and expenses of $91 million; and
◦pension mark-to-market losses recognized outside of a 10% corridor of $1.816 billion.
see item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the company's annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2018 filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 21, 2019.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations supplemental information - items affecting comparability we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states ("gaap") with certain non-gaap financial measures including, as applicable, "adjusted" compensation and benefits, operating expenses, operating profit, operating margin, other income and (expense), income before income taxes, income tax expense, effective tax rate, net income and earnings per share. adjusted financial measures may exclude the impact of period over period exchange rate changes and hedging activities, amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses, recognition of contingencies and transformation strategy costs, as described below. we believe that these adjusted financial measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and analysts in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. we believe these adjusted financial measures are important indicators of our recurring results of operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, our underlying operating results, and provide a useful baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. additionally, these adjusted financial measures are used internally by management for the determination of incentive compensation awards, business unit operating performance analysis and business unit resource allocation.
non-gaap financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as an alternative for, our reported results prepared in accordance with gaap. our non-gaap financial information does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. therefore, our non-gaap financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
the year over year comparisons of our financial results are affected by the following items (in millions):
year ended december 31, non-gaap adjustments                                                  2019   2018

these items have been excluded from comparisons of "adjusted" compensation and benefits, operating expenses, operating profit, operating margin, other income and (expense), income tax expense and effective tax rate in the discussion that follows. the income tax benefit from transformation strategy costs, legal contingencies and expenses and the mark-to-market charges are calculated by multiplying the statutory tax rates applicable in each tax jurisdiction, including the u.s. federal jurisdiction and various u.s. state and non-u.s. jurisdictions, by the tax deductible adjustments. the blended average of the effective tax rates in 2019 and 2018 were 23.2% and 24.0%, respectively.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and hedging activities we supplement the reporting of our revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit with non-gaap measures that exclude the period over period impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and hedging activities.
currency-neutral revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit are calculated by dividing current period reported u.s. dollar revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit by the current period average exchange rates to derive current period local currency revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit. the derived amounts are then multiplied by the average foreign exchange rates used to translate the comparable results for each month in the prior year period (including the period over period impact of foreign currency hedging activities). the difference between the current period reported u.s. dollar revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit and the derived current period u.s. dollar revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit is the period over period impact of currency fluctuations.

costs related to legal contingencies and expenses we supplement the presentation of our operating profit, operating margin, income before income taxes, net income and earnings per share with similar non-gaap measures that exclude the impact of costs related to certain of our legal contingencies and expenses. for information regarding legal contingencies and expenses, see note 9 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.
defined benefit plans mark-to-market charges we recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses in excess of a 10% corridor for our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans immediately as part of net periodic benefit cost other than service cost. we supplement the presentation of our income before income taxes, net income and earnings per share with "adjusted" measures that exclude the impact of the portion of net periodic benefit cost other than service cost represented by the gains and losses recognized in excess of the 10% corridor and the related income tax effects. we believe excluding these mark-to-market impacts from our adjusted results provides important supplemental information to remove the volatility caused by short-term changes in market interest rates, equity prices and similar factors.
this adjusted net periodic benefit cost ($754 million in 2019 and $615 million in 2018) utilizes the expected return on plan assets (7.68% in 2019 and 2018) and the discount rate used to determine net periodic benefit cost (4.45% in 2019 and 3.81% in 2018). the unadjusted net periodic benefit cost reflects the actual return on plan assets (17.57% in 2019 and -2.38% in 2018) and the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation at the december 31 measurement date (3.55% in 2019 and 4.45% in 2018).
we recognized pre-tax mark-to-market losses outside of a 10% corridor related to the remeasurement of our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans' assets and liabilities in "other income and (expense)" of $2.387 and $1.627 billion for 2019 and 2018, respectively. in october 2019, we refined the bond matching approach used to determine the discount rate for our u.s. pension and postretirement plans by implementing advances in technology and modeling techniques. this refinement decreased the projected benefit obligation on our consolidated balance sheet by approximately $900 million as of december 31, 2019, decreased the pre-tax mark-to-market charge by approximately $810 million and increased net income by $616 million, or $0.71 per share on a basic and diluted basis. this change did not have an impact on adjusted net income or adjusted earnings per share.

the pre-tax mark-to-market losses for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were comprised of the following components:
2019 - $2.387 billion pre-tax mark-to-market loss:
•   return on assets ($3.850 billion pre-tax gain): in 2019, the actual rate of return on plan assets was higher than our expected rate of return, primarily due to strong global equity and u.s. bond markets.
•   coordinating benefits attributable to the central states pension fund ($543 million pre-tax loss): this represents our current best estimate of the additional potential coordinating benefits that may be required to be paid related to the central states pension fund.
•   demographic and other assumption changes ($24 million pre-tax loss): this represents the difference between actual and estimated participant data and demographic factors, including items such as healthcare cost trends, compensation rate increases and rates of termination, retirement and mortality.
2018 - $1.627 billion pre-tax mark-to-market loss:
•   return on assets ($1.057 billion pre-tax loss): in 2018, the actual rate of return on plan assets was lower than our expected rate of return, primarily due to weak global equity markets.
•   coordinating benefits attributable to the central states pension fund ($1.393 billion pre-tax loss): this represented our then-current best estimate of potential coordinating benefits that may be required to be paid related to the central states pension fund.
•   demographic and other assumption changes ($22 million pre-tax loss): this represents the difference between actual and estimated participant data and demographic factors, including items such as healthcare cost trends, compensation rate increases and rates of termination, retirement and mortality.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations expense allocations certain operating expenses are allocated between our reporting segments using activity-based costing methods. these activity-based costing methods require us to make estimates that impact the amount of each expense category that is attributed to each segment. changes in these estimates will directly impact the amount of expense allocated to each segment, and therefore the operating profit of each reporting segment. our allocation methodologies are refined periodically, as necessary, to reflect changes in our businesses. there were no significant changes in our expense allocation methodologies during 2019, 2018 or 2017.

revenue the change in overall revenue was due to the following factors for the year ended december 31, 2019 versus 2018:
volume      rates /product mix          fuelsurcharge         total revenuechange revenue change drivers:
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations volume our overall volume increased across all products, led by strong growth in our next day air and deferred driven by the structural shift to faster delivery in retail and e-commerce, and from additional customer volume. we experienced growth from a number of large customers and smbs, with volume growth led by our largest customer, amazon. this growth was enabled by our on-going investment in automated facilities and other transformation initiatives.
business-to-consumer shipments, which represented approximately 54% of the total u.s. domestic package average daily volume, grew 11.3% for the year driven by the growth in e-commerce and retail. volume grew across all products, with particularly strong growth in our air products. business-to-business shipments increased 2.2% for the year with volume increases in both air and ground services.
within our air products, overall average daily volume increased in both next day air and deferred. strong air volume growth continued primarily in residential next day air and second day package products, as consumers and businesses continue to demand faster delivery options, which we expect will persist. this growth was slightly offset by declines in next day air letter and second day letter volume due to shifts in customer preferences.
we experienced year over year growth in both residential and commercial ground products. growth in residential ground volume was driven by changes in customer mix resulting from the continued growth in e-commerce, while growth in commercial ground products was primarily driven by an increase in retail return services.
overall revenue per piece decreased due to customer and product mix and fuel surcharge rates, partially offset by changes in base rates.
revenue per piece for ground and air products was positively impacted by a base rate increase on december 26, 2018. ups ground and ups air services rates increased an average net 4.9%.
revenue per piece for our next day air and deferred products decreased primarily due to a shift in customer and product mix and a decrease in average billable weight per piece, which was partially offset by the increase in base rates.
revenue per piece for our ground products increased primarily due to base rate increases and customer and product mix, partially offset by a decrease in average billable weight per piece.
fuel surcharges we apply a fuel surcharge on our domestic air and ground services. the air fuel surcharge is based on the u.s. department of energy's ("doe") gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene-type jet fuel, while the ground fuel surcharge is based on the doe's on-highway diesel fuel price. based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge rates for domestic air and ground products were as follows:
year ended december 31,          % point change while fluctuations in fuel surcharges can be significant from period to period, fuel surcharges represent one of the many individual components of our pricing structure that impact our overall revenue and yield. additional components include the mix of products sold, the base price and any additional charges or discounts on these services.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations revenue per piece for ground products was positively impacted by fuel surcharge rate increases during 2018, while fuel surcharge rates for air products decreased slightly for the year.
total domestic fuel surcharge revenue increased by $140 million for the year as a result of increases in package volume and shifts in product mix, partially offset by lower fuel surcharge rates on our air products.
operating expenses operating expenses, and operating expenses excluding the impact of transformation strategy costs and legal contingencies and expenses, increased largely due to pickup and delivery costs (up $1.385 billion), costs of operating our domestic integrated air and ground network (up $631 million), costs of package sorting (up $301 million) and other indirect operating costs (up $92 million).
in order to manage costs, we continually adjust our air and ground network to better match higher volume levels. in addition, we continue to deploy and utilize technology to increase package sorting and delivery productivity by reducing manual touchpoints. the growth in pickup and delivery and network operational costs was impacted by several factors:
•   higher employee compensation and benefit costs largely resulting from:
◦   volume growth, which resulted in an increase in average daily union labor hours of 4.7%;
◦   union pay rate and benefit increases; and
◦   growth in the overall size of the workforce due to facility expansions.
we incurred higher employee benefit expenses due to additional headcount, contractual contribution rate increases to union multiemployer plans and changes in benefit eligibility for certain union employees. these increases were slightly offset by lower pension expense for our company-sponsored plans due to higher discount rates used to measure the projected benefit obligations which reduced service costs, and lower premiums due to improved funded status.
•   we incurred slightly lower fuel expense for the year, driven by declines in fuel prices and higher alternative fuel tax credits in 2019 due to the passage of additional legislation. these reductions were partially offset by increased network volume, which resulted in higher fuel usage. aircraft block hours increased 10.3%, daily package delivery stops increased 10.9% and daily delivery miles increased 7.9%.
•   lower costs for outside contract carriers were the result of retaining additional volume within our network.
total cost per piece, which includes transformation strategy costs and legal contingencies and expenses, decreased 0.9% for the year. excluding the year over year impact of transformation strategy costs and legal contingencies and expenses, adjusted cost per piece decreased 0.8% for the year. year over year cost per piece decreased due to the incremental impact of our new automated facilities and other transformation initiatives.
operating profit and margin operating profit increased $521 million with operating margins increasing 60 basis points to 9.0%. excluding the year over year impact of transformation strategy costs and legal contingencies and expenses, adjusted operating profit increased $491 million with operating margins increasing 50 basis points to 9.4%. operating profit increased as a result of the items described above.

united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations volume our overall average daily volume decreased slightly due to weak demand from several sectors including high tech, manufacturing, professional services, automotive and government, partially offset by higher demand in healthcare, retail and other sectors.
export volume decreased slightly in 2019. european export volume declined across all trade lanes, while intra-european volume grew slightly. total u.s. export volume decreased, with declines in the europe and asia trade lanes partially offset by growth in the u.s. to americas and u.s. to ismea trade lanes. asia exports grew in all major trade lanes, with the exception of the united states. export volume for the year was strongest in our non-premium transborder standard product, offset by declines in our premium worldwide and transborder express services.
domestic volume also decreased slightly for the year as growth in several domestic markets was more than offset by challenging economic conditions, particularly in the united kingdom and other european countries. additionally, a postal strike in canada in 2018 drove additional domestic volume which did not repeat in 2019.
on december 26, 2018, we implemented an average 4.9% net increase in base and accessorial rates for international shipments originating in the united states. rate changes for shipments originating outside the u.s. are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market. on august 26, 2019, we implemented a 1.0% increase in international air-import fuel surcharge.
total average revenue per piece decreased in 2019 due entirely to a 170 basis point decrease from currency. excluding the impact of currency, revenue per piece increased 0.8% due to increases in base rates, partially offset by declines in fuel surcharge indices.
domestic revenue per piece decreased 120 basis points, driven entirely by a 390 basis point decrease from currency. excluding the impact of currency, revenue per piece increased 2.7% due to base rate increases.
export revenue per piece decreased 60 basis points, also driven entirely by a 110 basis point decrease from currency. excluding the impact of currency, revenue per piece increased 0.5% as the trend toward our lower priced non-premium services was more than offset by base rate increases.
fuel surcharges we apply fuel surcharges on our international air and ground services. the fuel surcharge for international air products originating inside or outside the united states is largely indexed to the doe's gulf coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene-type jet fuel. fuel surcharges for ground products originating outside the united states are indexed to fuel prices in the region or country where the shipments originate.
while fluctuations in fuel surcharges can be significant from period to period, fuel surcharges represent one of the many individual components of our pricing structure that impact our overall revenue and yield. additional components include the mix of products sold, the base price and any additional charges or discounts on these services.
operating expenses operating expenses, and operating expenses excluding the year over year impact of transformation strategy costs, decreased for 2019. these decreases are the results of effective management of network capacity and cost in response to lower volumes within our air, ground and local pickup and delivery networks, combined with lower fuel prices and currency exchange rate movements.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition to variability in usage and market prices, the manner in which we purchase fuel also influences the net impact of fuel on our results. the majority of our contracts for fuel purchases utilize index-based pricing formulas plus or minus a fixed locational/supplier differential. while many of the indices are aligned, each index may fluctuate at a different pace, driving variability in the prices paid for fuel. because of this, our operating results may be affected should the market price of fuel suddenly change by a significant amount or change by amounts that do not result in an adjustment in our fuel surcharges, which can affect our earnings either positively or negatively in the short-term.
the cost of operating our integrated international air and ground network decreased $130 million for 2019. the decrease in network costs was primarily driven by a 2.1% decrease in aircraft block hours, due in large part to our ability to adjust our global air network to match capacity with demand, and lower package volume for the year, together with lower fuel prices. pickup and delivery costs decreased $105 million in 2019. the remaining decrease in operating expenses was driven by a $40 million gain from the sale of surplus property in canada, as well as decreases in the costs of package sorting and other indirect operating costs.
operating profit and margin operating profit increased $128 million for the year, with operating margin increasing 120 basis points to 18.7%. excluding the year over year impact of transformation strategy costs, adjusted operating profit increased, with adjusted operating margin up 150 basis points to 19.5%. operating profit increased as a result of the items described above.

united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations revenue forwarding revenue decreased primarily due to an overall decline in market demand that was impacted by global trade uncertainties. this led to lower volume and declines in market rates in our international air and ocean freight forwarding businesses. in addition, excess capacity in the truckload brokerage market depressed rates, contributing to the year over year decrease in revenue. these decreases were partially offset by yield management initiatives in our air and ocean freight businesses.
logistics revenue increased as we experienced growth in the healthcare, mail services, retail and manufacturing sectors.
overall ups freight revenue increased, as declines in ltl tonnage and shipment volume which were largely attributable to market demand and the residual impacts of the fourth quarter 2018 network disruption were more than offset by yield management initiatives and volume growth in our ground freight pricing product.
operating expenses total operating expenses for the supply chain & freight segment, and operating expenses excluding the year over year impact of transformation strategy costs, decreased in 2019 compared with 2018.
forwarding operating expenses decreased $685 million largely due to reductions in purchased transportation. purchased transportation expense decreased $655 million primarily due to lower tonnage and declines in market rates in our international air and ocean freight forwarding businesses as well as a decrease in volume and market rates in truckload brokerage. cost management initiatives in our freight forwarding businesses also contributed to the reduction in operating expenses.
logistics operating expenses increased $172 million, primarily due to increases in purchased transportation driven by increased volume and rates, particularly in our mail services business. additionally, business investments in healthcare quality assurance and technology increased costs.
ups freight operating expenses decreased $54 million. decreases in costs associated with operating our linehaul network ($49 million) and decreases in pickup and delivery costs ($40 million) were driven by lower expenses from outside transportation carriers as a result of a decline in tonnage, lower fuel surcharges and the residual impacts of the fourth quarter 2018 network disruption. these decreases were offset by increases in transportation expense for our ground freight pricing product due to higher volume. cost management initiatives and production improvements largely contributed to the overall reduction in operating expenses.
operating profit and margin total operating profit for the supply chain & freight segment increased $125 million in 2019 compared with 2018. excluding the year over year impact of transformation strategy costs, adjusted operating profit increased $101 million. operating margin increased 110 basis points to 7.3%, while the adjusted operating margin increased 100 basis points to 7.5%. operating profit and margin were impacted by the items described above.

compensation and benefits total compensation and benefits, and total compensation and benefits excluding the year over year impact of transformation strategy costs, increased for 2019.
total compensation costs increased $1.028 billion or 4.6%. excluding the year over year impact of transformation strategy costs, adjusted compensation increased $1.007 billion largely due to higher u.s. domestic direct labor costs. these costs increased as a result of additional headcount, driven by u.s. domestic average daily volume growth that resulted in an increase in average daily union hours of 4.7%. contractual union wage increases also contributed to the increase in compensation for hourly employees.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations benefits costs increased $645 million. excluding the year over year impact of transformation strategy costs, adjusted benefits costs increased $762 million due to the following:
•   health and welfare costs increased $570 million, driven by higher contributions to multiemployer plans due to contractual rate increases, an overall increase in the size of the workforce and changes in eligibility for certain union employees.
•   pension and retirement benefits increased $18 million. the impacts of contractually-mandated contribution increases to multiemployer plans, as well as an increase in the size of the overall workforce, were substantially offset by lower service cost for company-sponsored plans as a result of higher discount rates.
•   vacation, excused absence, payroll taxes and other expenses increased $211 million, primarily driven by salary increases and growth in the overall size of the workforce.
•   workers' compensation expense decreased $37 million as we experienced more favorable actuarial adjustments. we evaluate the total range of actuarial outcomes when estimating losses that will ultimately occur. see note 1 to the audited, consolidated financial statements for a further description of this policy.
repairs and maintenance the increase in repairs and maintenance expense was driven by maintenance of our aircraft, routine repairs to buildings and facilities and maintenance of our other transportation equipment, due to additional investments we have made in recent periods.
we evaluate the useful lives of all our property, plant and equipment based on our usage, maintenance and replacement policies, and taking into account physical and economic factors that may affect the useful lives of the assets. see note 1 to the audited, consolidated financial statements for a further description of the policy.
for 2019, depreciation expense increased $365 million, and net income decreased by $287 million, or $0.33 per share on a basic and diluted basis, as a result of investments in property, plant and equipment, net of disposals and assets becoming fully depreciated. depreciation expense decreased $212 million, and net income increased $167 million, or $0.19 per share on a basic and diluted basis, as a result of lengthening our estimated useful lives for various asset categories in the latter half of 2018. the combined effect of the foregoing was a net increase in depreciation expense of $153 million and a decrease in net income of $120 million, or $0.14 per share on a basic and diluted basis, for the year.
the decrease in purchased transportation expense charged to us by third-party air, rail, ocean and truck carriers was primarily driven by the following factors:
•   expense in our freight forwarding and logistics business decreased $530 million due to decreases in both market rates and volume in our air and ocean freight forwarding businesses. our truckload brokerage business also experienced declines in rates, primarily driven by market overcapacity. these decreases were partially offset by increases due to volume growth and rate increases in our mail services business.
•   u.s. domestic package expense decreased $186 million primarily due to lower overall usage of third-party transportation carriers.
•   international package expense decreased $100 million primarily due to favorable currency exchange rate movements.
•   other purchased transportation expense decreased $3 million due to changes in the number of leased and chartered aircraft and lower fuel surcharges passed on to us by outside carriers.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations fuel the decrease in fuel expense was driven by lower jet fuel, diesel and gasoline prices as well as higher alternative fuel tax credits as a result of legislation passed in 2019. these decreases were partially offset by higher consumption due to additional aircraft block hours and vehicle miles driven by higher u.s. domestic package volume.
the increase in other occupancy expense and other occupancy expense excluding the year over year impact of transformation strategy costs was primarily driven by additional operating facilities coming into service.
other expenses, and other expenses excluding the year over year impact of transformation strategy costs and legal contingencies and expenses, increased for 2019. the increase was attributable to various items, including adjustments to reserves for self-insured automobile liability claims, bad debt expense, technology equipment and software licenses, professional service fees and advertising. these increases were partially offset by a $40 million gain on the sale of surplus property in canada and lower travel and entertainment expenses.

united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources as of december 31, 2019, we had $5.741 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. we believe that our current cash position, access to commercial paper programs and debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be adequate not only for operating requirements, but also to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs, transformation strategy and to fund dividend payments, share repurchases, pension contributions and long-term debt payments through the next several years. we regularly evaluate opportunities to optimize our capital structure, including through issuances of debt or equity to refinance existing debt and to fund ongoing cash needs.
cash flows from operating activities the following is a summary of the significant sources (uses) of cash from operating activities (in millions):

(1) represents depreciation and amortization, gains and losses on derivative transactions and foreign exchange, deferred income taxes, provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable, amortization on operating lease assets, pension and postretirement benefit expense, stock compensation expense and other non-cash items.
cash from operating activities remained strong throughout 2018 and 2019. most of the variability in operating cash flows during this period related to funding company-sponsored pension and postretirement benefit plans (and related cash tax deductions). except for discretionary or accelerated fundings of our plans, contributions to our company-sponsored pension plans have largely varied in accordance with minimum funding requirements. we made discretionary contributions to our three primary, company-sponsored u.s. pension plans totaling $2.0 billion in 2019. no discretionary contributions were made in 2018. the remaining contributions in 2018 and 2019 were to our international pension plans and u.s. postretirement medical benefit plans.
operating cash flows were impacted by changes in our working capital management whereby certain payments from the fourth quarter of 2018 shifted into the first quarter of 2019. in addition, accelerated growth in the business lifted overall working capital demand. the net hedge margin collateral received from our derivative counterparties was $171 and $482 million during 2019 and 2018, respectively, due to the change in net fair value of the derivative contracts used in our currency and interest rate hedging programs. cash payments for income taxes were $514 million and $2 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively, primarily due to timing of deductions related to pension contributions.
as of december 31, 2019, our total worldwide holdings of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $5.741 billion, of which approximately $2.564 billion was held by foreign subsidiaries. the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our u.s. and foreign subsidiaries fluctuates throughout the year due to a variety of factors, including the timing of cash receipts and disbursements in the normal course of business. cash provided by operating activities in the u.s. continues to be our primary source of funds to finance domestic operating needs, capital expenditures, share repurchases, pension contributions and dividend payments to shareowners. all cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries are generally available for distribution to the u.s. without any u.s. federal income taxes. any such distributions may be subject to foreign withholding and u.s. state taxes. when amounts earned by foreign subsidiaries are expected to be indefinitely reinvested, no accrual for taxes is provided.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cash flows from investing activities our primary sources (uses) of cash for investing activities were as follows (amounts in millions):

(1) in addition to capital expenditures of $6.380 and $6.283 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively, there were capital expenditures relating to the principal repayments of finance lease obligations of $140 and $340 million. these are included in cash flows from financing activities.
we have commitments for the purchase of aircraft, vehicles, equipment and real estate to provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth. we generally fund our capital expenditures with cash from operations. future capital spending for anticipated growth and replacement assets will depend on a variety of factors, including economic and industry conditions. in 2017 we began a multi-year investment program in our smart global logistics network which impacts all asset categories, with the largest investments in buildings, facilities and plant equipment. this investment program will continue in 2020, and we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately $6.5 to $7.0 billion.
capital expenditures on buildings, facilities and plant equipment decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 in our u.s. and international package businesses, as we completed several facility automation and capacity expansion projects in 2018. capital spending on aircraft increased in 2019 compared 2018 due to a net increase in contract deposits on open aircraft orders and final payments associated with the delivery of aircraft. capital spending on information technology increased in 2019 compared to 2018 due to continuing development of technology enabled solutions and capitalized software projects. capital spending on vehicles increased in 2019 relative to 2018, largely due to the timing of vehicle replacements and expansion of the overall fleet to support volume growth.
proceeds from the disposal of property, plant and equipment were largely attributable to the sale of an international property in 2019 and disposal of equipment in 2018. the net change in finance receivables was due to reductions in our finance portfolios in 2019 compared with 2018. purchases and sales of marketable securities are largely determined by liquidity needs and the periodic rebalancing of investment types, and will fluctuate from period to period.
cash paid for business acquisitions in 2019 and 2018 related to our acquisition of area franchise rights for the ups store, as well as other, small acquisitions in our international small package and logistics business units in 2019. other investing activities are impacted by changes in our non-current investments and various other items.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cash flows from financing activities our primary sources (uses) of cash for financing activities were as follows (amounts in millions, except per share data):

total capitalization                                  $28,521              $25,773
for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, we repurchased a total of 9.1 and 8.9 million shares of class a and class b common stock for $1.005 and $1.000 billion, respectively ($1.004 and $1.011 billion in repurchases for 2019 and 2018, respectively, are reported on the cash flow statement due to the timing of settlements). for additional information on our share repurchase activities, see note 11 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.
for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, dividends reported within shareowners' equity include $147 and $178 million, respectively, of non-cash dividends that were settled in shares of class a common stock.
the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the board of directors and depends on various factors, including our net income, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other relevant factors. we expect to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends. in february 2020, we increased our quarterly dividend payment from $0.96 to $1.01 per share, a 5.2% increase.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations issuances of debt in 2019 consisted of fixed-rate senior notes totaling $3.0 billion and commercial paper. in 2018, issuances of debt consisted primarily of commercial paper. the following is a summary of debt issuances in 2019 (in millions):
repayments of debt in 2019 and 2018 consisted primarily of our $1.0 billion 5.125% fixed-rate senior notes that matured in april 2019 and our $750 million 5.50% fixed-rate senior notes that matured in january 2018. the remaining repayments of debt during the period included paydowns of commercial paper and scheduled principal payments on our finance lease obligations. we consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and non-scheduled repayments of debt.
the amount of commercial paper outstanding fluctuates throughout the year based on daily liquidity needs. the following is a summary of our commercial paper program (in millions):
the variation in cash received from common stock issuances was primarily due to the amount of stock option exercises by employees in 2018 and 2019.
other financing activities includes cash used to repurchase shares from employees sold to satisfy tax withholding obligations on vested stock awards of $180 and $259 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. net cash inflows from premium payments and settlements of capped call options for the purchase of ups class b shares were $21 and $34 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.
sources of credit see note 8 to the audited, consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our available credit and debt covenants.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations guarantees and other off-balance sheet arrangements except as disclosed in note 8 to the audited, consolidated financial statements, we do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on financial condition or liquidity.
contractual commitments we have contractual obligations and commitments in the form of finance leases, operating leases, debt obligations, purchase commitments and certain other liabilities. we intend to satisfy these obligations primarily through the use of cash flow from operations. the following table summarizes the expected cash outflow to satisfy our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31, 2019 (in millions):
operating leases                       619                 536                 451                 360                 256               1,267                 3,489
(1) purchase commitments includes amounts due under aircraft leases that we entered into in 2019 and our january 29, 2020 announced commitment to purchase 10,000 electric vehicles.
our finance lease obligations relate primarily to leases on aircraft and real estate. finance leases and operating leases are discussed further in note 10 to the audited, consolidated financial statements. purchase commitments, as well as our debt principal obligations, are discussed further in note 8 to the audited, consolidated financial statements. the amount of interest on our debt was calculated as the contractual interest payments due on our fixed-rate debt and variable rate debt based on interest rates as of december 31, 2019. the calculations of debt interest take into account the effect of interest rate swap agreements. for debt denominated in a foreign currency, the u.s. dollar equivalent principal amount of the debt at the end of the year was used as the basis to calculate future interest payments.
purchase commitments represent contractual agreements to purchase assets, goods or services that are legally binding, including contracts for aircraft, construction of new or expanded facilities and orders for technology equipment and vehicles. as of december 31, 2019, we had firm commitments to lease three used and purchase eight new boeing 767-300 aircraft, to be delivered between 2020 and 2021 and to purchase 13 new boeing 747-8f aircraft to be delivered between 2020 and 2022. we also had a firm commitment to purchase five boeing md-11 aircraft to be delivered between 2020 and 2021. we paid the full purchase price for these md-11 aircraft in december 2019; therefore these amounts are not included in the table above.
on december 22, 2017, the united states enacted into law the tax act requiring a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. companies may elect to pay the tax over eight years based on an installment schedule outlined in the tax act but are required under current internal revenue service guidance to offset certain overpayments of tax against the liability. we made this election and have reflected our remaining transition tax due by year as a contractual obligation.
there are no anticipated required minimum cash contributions to our qualified u.s. pension plans (these plans are discussed further in note 5 to the audited, consolidated financial statements). the amount of any minimum funding requirement, as applicable, for these plans could change significantly in future periods depending on many factors, including future plan asset returns, discount rates, other actuarial assumptions and changes to pension plan funding regulations. a decline in discount rates or a sustained significant decline in equity or bond returns could result in our domestic pension plans being subject to significantly higher minimum funding requirements. actual contributions made in future years could materially differ and consequently required minimum contributions beyond 2020 cannot be reasonably estimated.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as discussed in note 6 to the audited, consolidated financial statements, we are not currently subject to any minimum contributions or surcharges with respect to the multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans in which we participate. contribution rates to these multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans are established through the collective bargaining process. as we are not subject to any minimum contribution levels, we have not included any amounts in the contractual commitments table with respect to these multiemployer plans.
the table above does not include approximately $228 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions because we are uncertain if or when such amounts will ultimately be settled in cash. uncertain tax positions are further discussed in note 14 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.
as of december 31, 2019, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $1.267 billion issued in connection with our self-insurance reserves and other routine business requirements. we also issue surety bonds as an alternative to letters of credit in certain instances, and as of december 31, 2019, we had $1.327 billion of surety bonds written. as of december 31, 2019, we had unfunded loan commitments totaling $131 million associated with ups capital.
we believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected long-term needs for the operation of our business, including anticipated capital expenditures, transformation strategy and pension contributions for the foreseeable future.

rate adjustments effective december 29, 2019, the rates and accessorial charges for ups ground, ups air and international services increased by an average net 4.9%. ups air freight rates within and between the u.s., canada and puerto rico increased an average net 4.2%. density-based ups freight non-contractual ltl rates using tariff 580 increased an average net 3.9%.
these rate changes are customary and occur on an annual basis. rate changes for shipments originating outside the u.s. are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with gaap. as indicated in note 1 to the audited, consolidated financial statements, the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with gaap. we base our estimates on prior experience and assumptions and third-party input that we consider reasonable to our circumstances. actual results could differ materially from our estimates, which would affect the related amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. while estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts, we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity.
contingencies as discussed in note 9 to the audited, consolidated financial statements, we are involved in various legal proceedings and subject to various contingencies. the events that may impact our contingent liabilities are often unique and generally are not predictable. at the time a contingency is identified, we consider all relevant facts as part of our evaluation. we record a liability for a loss when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable. events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss to us that differs from our previously estimated liability. this difference could be material. income taxes and self-insurance are discussed below. except as disclosed in note 9 to the audited, consolidated financial statements, other contingent losses that were probable and estimable were not material to our financial position or results of operations as of, or for the year ended, december 31, 2019. in addition, we have certain contingent liabilities that have not been recognized as of, or for the year ended, december 31, 2019, because a loss was not reasonably estimable.
goodwill and intangible impairment we test goodwill for impairment in each of our reporting units on an annual basis. our u.s. domestic package segment is a reporting unit. in our international package reporting segment, we have the following reporting units: europe, asia, americas and ismea. in our supply chain & freight segment we have the following reporting units: forwarding, logistics, ups mail innovations, ups freight, the ups store, ups capital, marken and coyote logistics. our annual goodwill impairment testing date is july 1st for each reporting unit owned at the testing date. in assessing goodwill for impairment, we initially evaluate qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive and it is necessary to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit, then we utilize a two-step process to test goodwill for impairment. first, a comparison of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with the aggregate carrying value, including goodwill, is performed. if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss. the second step includes comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill.
we primarily determine the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow ("dcf") model and supplement this with observable valuation multiples for comparable companies, as appropriate. the completion of the dcf model requires that we make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows. these assumptions include projections of future revenue, costs, capital expenditures and working capital changes, as well as assumptions about the estimated cost of capital and other relevant variables. the projections that we use in our dcf model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units. the determination of whether goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of judgment in these assumptions, and changes in our business strategy, government regulations, or economic or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments. we routinely monitor market conditions and other factors to determine if interim impairment tests are necessary. if impairment indicators are present in future periods, the resulting impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations.
none of the reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in 2019 or 2018. changes in our forecasts could cause carrying values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods, potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. during the year, management monitored the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumptions used during our annual goodwill impairment test. for the periods presented, no triggering events were identified that required an interim impairment test. based on most recent tests, the fair value of all our reporting units exceed their carrying value.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations a trade name with a carrying value of $200 million and licenses with a carrying value of $4 million as of december 31, 2019 are considered to be indefinite-lived intangibles, and therefore are not amortized. impairment tests for indefinite-lived intangibles are performed on an annual basis. we determined that the income approach, specifically the relief from royalty method, is the most appropriate valuation method for the trade name. the estimated fair value of the trade name is compared to the carrying value of the asset. if the carrying value of the trade name exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. this valuation approach requires that we make a number of assumptions to estimate fair value. these assumptions include projections of future revenues, market royalty rates, tax rates, discount rates and other relevant variables. the projections we use in the model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions.
all of our remaining recorded intangible assets are deemed to be finite-lived intangibles, and are amortized over their estimated useful lives. impairment tests for these intangible assets are only performed when a triggering event occurs that indicates that the carrying value of the intangible may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the intangible. if the carrying amount of the intangible is determined not to be recoverable, a write-down to fair value is recorded. fair values are determined based on a dcf model. if impairment indicators are present in future periods, the resulting impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations. impairments of finite-lived intangible assets were $2 and $12 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. there were no impairments of indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2019 or 2018.
self-insurance accruals we self-insure costs associated with workers' compensation claims, automobile liability, health and welfare and general business liabilities, up to certain limits. insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims, as well as loss estimates for claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. recorded balances are based on third-party actuarial estimates, which incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected cost per claim. trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of our reserves.
workers' compensation, automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to completely settle. consequently, actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve a claim. a number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of time the claim remains open, trends in healthcare costs, the results of any related litigation and with respect to workers' compensation claims and changes in legislation. furthermore, claims may emerge in a future year for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from actuarial projections. all of these factors can result in revisions to actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results. based on our historical experience, during 2019 we changed our self-insurance reserves from the central estimate to the low end of the actuarial range of losses. we believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate; actual experience in claim frequency and/or severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations. for additional information on our self-insurance reserves, refer to note 1 of the audited, consolidated financial statements.
we sponsor a number of health and welfare insurance plans for our employees. liabilities and expenses related to these plans are based on estimates of, among other things, the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans, anticipated medical usage by participants and overall trends in medical costs and inflation. we believe our estimates are reasonable/appropriate. actual experience may differ from these estimates and, therefore, produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results.
pension and postretirement medical benefits our pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies. these assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates, inflation, compensation increase rates, expected returns on plan assets, mortality rates and other factors. the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans represent our best estimates, and we believe that they are reasonable, based on information as to historical experience and performance as well as other factors that might cause future expectations to differ from past trends.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expenses. the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses each year are (1) changes in the discount rate used to value pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of the measurement date, (2) differences between the expected and the actual return on plan assets, (3) changes in demographic assumptions including mortality, (4) participant experience different from demographic assumptions and (5) changes in coordinating benefits with plans not sponsored by ups. in october 2019, we refined the bond matching approach used to determine the discount rate for our u.s. pension and postretirement plans by implementing advances in technology and modeling techniques. this refinement decreased the projected benefit obligation on our consolidated balance sheet by approximately $900 million as of december 31, 2019, decreased the pre-tax mark-to-market charge by approximately $810 million and increased net income by $616 million, or $0.71 per share on a basic and diluted basis.
we recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of a corridor (defined as 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans' projected benefit obligations) in pension expense annually at december 31st each year. the remaining components of pension expense (herein referred to as "ongoing net periodic benefit cost"), primarily service and interest costs and the expected return on plan assets, are reported on a quarterly basis.
the following sensitivity analysis shows the impact of a 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate and return on assets for our pension and postretirement benefit plans, and the resulting increase/(decrease) on our obligations and expense as of, and for the year ended, december 31, 2019 (in millions).

united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations depreciation, residual value and impairment of fixed assets as of december 31, 2019, we had $30.482 billion of net fixed assets, the most significant category of which is aircraft. in accounting for fixed assets, we make estimates of the expected useful lives, the expected residual values and the potential for impairment based on the fair values of the assets and the cash flows which they generate.
in estimating the lives and expected residual values of aircraft, we rely upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types. revisions to these estimates could be caused by changes to our maintenance programs, changes in the utilization of the aircraft, governmental regulations on aging aircraft and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types. we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions, and adjust them as necessary. adjustments are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense. in 2019, we revised our estimates of the useful lives and residual values for certain airframes, engines and related rotable parts. this change increased the useful lives of certain fleet types and reduced the useful lives and residual values of the majority of our used aircraft. the net impact to 2019 depreciation expense was not material. in estimating cash flows, we project future volume levels for our different air products in all geographic regions in which we do business. adverse changes in these volume forecasts, or a shortfall of our actual volume compared with our projections, could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand. this situation could lead to an excess of a particular aircraft, resulting in an aircraft impairment charge or a reduction of the expected life of an aircraft (thus resulting in increased depreciation expense).
we evaluate the useful lives of our property, plant and equipment based on our usage, maintenance and replacement policies, and taking into account physical and economic factors that may affect the useful lives of the assets. as part of our ongoing investment in transformation in 2018, we revised our estimates of useful lives for building improvements, vehicles and plant equipment based on our current assessment of these factors. in general, these changes in estimate had the effect of lengthening the useful lives of vehicles, building improvements and plant equipment, and were applied prospectively beginning in 2018 through depreciation expense. see "consolidated operating expenses" of this "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" for the discussion of the impacts to "depreciation and amortization." see note 1 to the audited, consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies and note 4 for a discussion of the change in estimated useful lives.
we review long-lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset. if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable, a write-down to fair value is recorded. fair values are determined based on quoted market values, discounted cash flows or external appraisals, as appropriate. we review long-lived assets for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flows can be identified. the circumstances that would indicate potential impairment may include, but are not limited to, a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset.
there were no impairment charges on our property, plant and equipment during 2019 or 2018.
fair value measurements in the normal course of business, we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk, including derivatives, marketable securities, finance receivables, pension assets, other investments and debt. certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value, principally derivatives, marketable securities, pension assets and certain other investments. fair values are based on listed market prices, when such prices are available. to the extent that listed market prices are not available, fair value is determined based on other relevant factors, including dealer price quotations. if listed market prices or other relevant factors are not available, inputs are developed from unobservable data reflecting our own assumptions and include situations where there is little or no market activity for the asset or liability. certain financial instruments, including over-the-counter derivative instruments, are valued using pricing models that consider, among other factors, contractual and market prices, correlations, time value, credit spreads and yield curve volatility factors. changes in the fixed income, foreign exchange and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future, potentially affecting our results of operations. a quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates is presented in the "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" section of this report.
united parcel service, inc. and subsidiaries management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain non-financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including property, plant, and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. these assets are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis; however, they are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence of an impairment.
for acquisitions, we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired customers, technology and trade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives and discount rates. management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. during the measurement period, which is one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.
income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income by legal entity and jurisdiction, tax credits, benefits and deductions, and in the calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as tax, interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period.
we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. if recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. we believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. however, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely.
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. once it is determined that the position meets the recognition threshold, the second step requires us to estimate and measure the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. the difference between the amount of recognizable tax benefit and the total amount of tax benefit from positions filed or to be filed with the tax authorities is recorded as a liability for uncertain tax benefits. it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. we reevaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. this evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.
see note 14 to the audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of impacts of the tax act.

the above list is not exhaustive, and the company faces additional challenges and risks. investors should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this form 10-k, including the following risk factors, before deciding to invest in any of the company's securities.
table of contents risk factors the risks below are not the only ones the company faces. additional risks not currently known to the company or that the company presently deems immaterial may also impair its business operations. the company's business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. this form 10-k also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. the company's results could materially differ from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks it faces described below and elsewhere. see "cautionary factors that may affect future results" below.
risks related to the company's business the company is dependent on its patent rights, and if its patent rights are invalidated or circumvented, its business could be materially adversely affected.
patent protection is considered, in the aggregate, to be of material importance to the company's marketing of human health and animal health products in the u.s. and in most major foreign markets. patents covering products that it has introduced normally provide market exclusivity, which is important for the successful marketing and sale of its products. the company seeks patents covering each of its products in each of the markets where it intends to sell the products and where meaningful patent protection is available.
even if the company succeeds in obtaining patents covering its products, third parties or government authorities may challenge or seek to invalidate or circumvent its patents and patent applications. it is important for the company's business to successfully assert and defend the patent rights that provide market exclusivity for its products. the company is often involved in patent disputes relating to challenges to its patents or claims by third parties of infringement against the company. the company asserts and defends its patents both within and outside the u.s., including by filing claims of infringement against other parties. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data," note 11. "contingencies and environmental liabilities" below. in particular, manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products from time to time file abbreviated ndas with the fda seeking to market generic forms of the company's products prior to the expiration of relevant patents owned or licensed by the company. the company normally responds by asserting its patent with a lawsuit alleging patent infringement. patent litigation and other challenges to the company's patents are costly and unpredictable and may deprive the company of market exclusivity for a patented product or, in some cases, third-party patents may prevent the company from marketing and selling a product in a particular geographic area.
additionally, certain foreign governments have indicated that compulsory licenses to patents may be granted in the case of national emergencies or in other circumstances, which could diminish or eliminate sales and profits from those regions and negatively affect the company's results of operations. further, court decisions relating to other companies' patents, potential legislation in both the u.s. and certain foreign markets relating to patents, as well as regulatory initiatives may result in a more general weakening of intellectual property protection.
if one or more important products lose patent protection in profitable markets, sales of those products are likely to decline significantly as a result of generic versions of those products becoming available. the company's results of operations may be adversely affected by the lost sales unless and until the company has launched commercially successful products that replace the lost sales. in addition, if products that were measured at fair value and capitalized in connection with acquisitions experience difficulties in the market that negatively affect product cash flows, the company may recognize material non-cash impairment charges with respect to the value of those products.
a chart listing the patent protection for certain of the company's marketed products, and u.s. patent protection for candidates in phase 3 clinical development is set forth above in item 1. "business - patents, trademarks and licenses."
as the company's products lose market exclusivity, the company generally experiences a significant and rapid loss of sales from those products.
the company depends upon patents to provide it with exclusive marketing rights for its products for some period of time. loss of patent protection for one of the company's products typically leads to a significant and table of contents rapid loss of sales for that product as lower priced generic versions of that drug become available. in the case of products that contribute significantly to the company's sales, the loss of market exclusivity can have a material adverse effect on the company's business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. januvia and janumet will lose market exclusivity in the u.s. in january 2023. januvia and janumet will lose market exclusivity in the eu in september 2022 and in china in july 2022. the company anticipates sales of januvia and janumet in these markets will decline substantially after the loss of exclusivity.
key products generate a significant amount of the company's profits and cash flows, and any events that adversely affect the markets for its leading products could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations and financial condition.
the company's ability to generate profits and operating cash flow depends largely upon the continued profitability of the company's key products, such as keytruda, gardasil/gardasil 9, lynparza, bravecto, and bridion. in particular, in 2021, the company's oncology portfolio, led by keytruda, represented a substantial portion of the company's revenue growth. as a result of the company's dependence on key products, any event that adversely affects any of these products or the markets for any of these products could have a significant adverse impact on results of operations and financial condition. these events could include loss of patent protection, increased costs associated with manufacturing, generic or over-the-counter availability of the company's product or a competitive product, the discovery of previously unknown side effects, results of post-approval trials, increased competition from the introduction of new, more effective treatments and discontinuation or removal from the market of the product for any reason. such events could have a material adverse effect on the sales of any such products.
the company's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and the company may not be able to acquire commercially successful products in other ways; in consequence, the company may not be able to replace sales of successful products that lose patent protection.
in order to remain competitive, the company, like other major pharmaceutical companies, must continue to launch new products. expected declines in sales of products after the loss of market exclusivity mean that the company's future success is dependent on its pipeline of new products, including new products that it may develop through collaborations and joint ventures and products that it is able to obtain through license or acquisition. to accomplish this, the company commits substantial effort, funds and other resources to research and development, both through its own dedicated resources and through various collaborations with third parties. there is a high rate of failure inherent in the research and development process for new drugs and vaccines. as a result, there is a high risk that funds invested by the company in research programs will not generate financial returns. this risk profile is compounded by the fact that this research has a long investment cycle. to bring a pharmaceutical compound from the discovery phase to market may take a decade or more and failure can occur at any point in the process, including later in the process after significant funds have been invested.
for a description of the research and development process, see item 1. "business - research and development" above. each phase of testing is highly regulated and during each phase there is a substantial risk that the company will encounter serious obstacles or will not achieve its goals. therefore, the company may abandon a product in which it has invested substantial amounts of time and resources. some of the risks encountered in the research and development process include the following: pre-clinical testing of a new compound may yield disappointing results; competing products from other manufacturers may reach the market first; clinical trials of a new drug may not be successful; a new drug may not be effective or may have harmful side effects; a new drug may not be approved by the regulators for its intended use; it may not be possible to obtain a patent for a new drug; payers may refuse to cover or reimburse the new product; or sales of a new product may be disappointing.
the company cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products now under development will be approved or launched; whether it will be able to develop, license or otherwise acquire compounds, product candidates or products; or whether any products, once launched, will be commercially successful. the company must maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and successful new indications for existing products sufficient both to cover its substantial research and development costs and to replace sales that are lost as profitable products lose market exclusivity or are displaced by competing products or therapies. failure to do so in the short table of contents term or long term would have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations, cash flow, financial condition and prospects.
the company's success is dependent on the successful development and marketing of new products, which are subject to substantial risks.
products that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or fail to succeed for numerous reasons, including the following:
•findings of ineffectiveness, superior safety or efficacy of competing products, or harmful side effects in clinical or pre-clinical testing;
•failure to receive the necessary regulatory approvals, including delays in the approval of new products and new indications, or the anticipated labeling, and uncertainties about the time required to obtain regulatory approvals and the benefit/risk standards applied by regulatory agencies in determining whether to grant approvals;
•failure in certain markets to obtain reimbursement commensurate with the level of innovation and clinical benefit presented by the product;
•lack of economic feasibility due to manufacturing costs or other factors; and
•preclusion from commercialization by the proprietary rights of others.
in the future, if certain pipeline programs are cancelled or if the company believes that their commercial prospects have been reduced, the company may recognize material non-cash impairment charges for those programs that were measured at fair value and capitalized in connection with acquisitions or certain collaborations.
failure to successfully develop and market new products in the short term or long term would have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations, cash flow, financial condition and prospects.
the company faces continued pricing pressure with respect to its products.
the company faces continued pricing pressure globally and, particularly in mature markets, from managed care organizations, government agencies and programs that could negatively affect the company's sales and profit margins. in the u.s., these include (i) practices of managed care groups and institutional and governmental purchasers, (ii) u.s. federal laws and regulations related to medicare and medicaid, including the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 and the aca, and (iii) state activities aimed at increasing price transparency, including new laws as noted above in item 1. "competition and the health care environment." changes to the health care system enacted as part of health care reform in the u.s., as well as increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of medicare, medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, could result in further pricing pressures. in addition, in the u.s., larger customers have received higher rebates on drugs in certain highly competitive categories. the company must also compete to be placed on formularies of managed care organizations. exclusion of a product from a formulary can lead to reduced usage in the managed care organization.
in order to provide information about the company's pricing practices, the company annually posts on its website its pricing transparency report for the u.s. the report provides the company's average annual list price and net price increases across the company's u.s. portfolio dating back to 2010. in 2021, the company's gross u.s. sales were reduced by 43.5% as a result of rebates, discounts and returns.
outside the u.s., numerous major markets, including the eu, japan and china have pervasive government involvement in funding health care and, in that regard, fix the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and vaccine products. consequently, in those markets, the company is subject to government decision making and budgetary actions with respect to its products. in japan, the pharmaceutical industry is subject to government-mandated annual price reductions of pharmaceutical products and certain vaccines. furthermore, the government can order re-pricing for specific products if it determines that use of such product will exceed certain thresholds defined under applicable re-pricing rules.
table of contents the company expects pricing pressures to continue in the future.
unfavorable or uncertain economic conditions, together with cost-reduction measures being taken by certain governments, could negatively affect the company's operating results.
the company's business may be adversely affected by local and global economic conditions, including with respect to inflation, interest rates, and costs of raw materials and packaging. uncertainty in global economic and geopolitical conditions may result in a slowdown to the global economy that could affect the company's business by reducing the prices that drug wholesalers and retailers, hospitals, government agencies and managed health care providers may be able or willing to pay for the company's products or by reducing the demand for the company's products, which could in turn negatively impact the company's sales and result in a material adverse effect on the company's business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
as discussed above in "competition and the health care environment," global efforts toward health care cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing and market access worldwide. changes to the u.s. health care system as part of health care reform, as well as increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of medicare, medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, have contributed to pricing pressure. in several international markets, government-mandated pricing actions have reduced prices of generic and patented drugs. in addition, the company's revenue performance in 2021 was negatively affected by other cost-reduction measures taken by governments and other third parties to lower health care costs. the company anticipates all of these actions, and additional actions in the future, will continue to negatively affect revenue performance.
if credit and economic conditions worsen, the resulting economic and currency impacts in the affected markets and globally could have a material adverse effect on the company's results.
in addition, the covid-19 pandemic has caused some disruption and volatility in the company's global supply chain network, and the company may experience disruptions in availability and delays in shipments of raw materials and packaging, as well as related cost inflation. any such disruptions, delays or costs may result in the company's inability to meet demand for the company's products.
in general, the company faces increasing competition from lower-cost generic products. the patent rights that protect its products are of varying strengths and durations. in addition, in some countries, patent protection is significantly weaker than in the u.s. or in the eu. in the u.s. and the eu, political pressure to reduce spending on prescription drugs has led to legislation and other measures that encourage the use of generic and biosimilar products. although it is the company's policy to actively protect its patent rights, generic challenges to the company's products can arise at any time, and the company's patents may not prevent the emergence of generic competition for its products.
loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by generic substitutes, reducing the company's sales of that product. availability of generic substitutes for the company's drugs may adversely affect its results of operations and cash flow. in addition, proposals emerge from time to time in the u.s. and other countries for legislation to further encourage the early and rapid approval of generic drugs. any such proposal that is enacted into law could worsen this substantial negative effect on the company's sales and, potentially, its business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
the company's products face intense competition from competitors' products. this competition may increase as new products enter the market. in such an event, the competitors' products may be safer or more effective, more convenient to use, have better insurance coverage or reimbursement levels or be more effectively marketed and sold than the company's products. alternatively, in the case of generic competition, including the generic availability of competitors' branded products, they may be equally safe and effective products that are sold at a substantially lower price than the company's products. as a result, if the company fails to maintain its competitive position, this could have a material adverse effect on its business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. in addition, if products that were measured at fair value and capitalized in table of contents connection with acquisitions experience difficulties in the market that negatively impact product cash flows, the company may recognize material non-cash impairment charges with respect to the value of those products.
in 2021 and 2020, covid-19-related disruptions had an adverse impact on the company's business, operations and financial performance. the company is unable to predict the full extent to which the covid-19 pandemic or any future pandemic, epidemic or similar public health threat will adversely impact its business, operations, financial performance, results of operations, and financial condition.
the company's business and financial results were negatively impacted by covid-19-related disruptions in 2021 and 2020. the continued duration and severity of the covid-19 pandemic is uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult to predict. the degree to which covid-19-related disruptions impact the company's results in 2022 will depend on future developments, beyond the company's knowledge or control, including, but not limited to, the duration of the pandemic, its severity, the success of actions taken to contain or prevent the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.
in 2021, the covid-19 pandemic impacted the company's business in numerous ways. as expected, within the company's human health business, which is comprised largely of physician-administered products, revenue was negatively impacted by social distancing measures and fewer well visits, which negatively affected vaccine and oncology sales in particular. the estimated negative impact of covid-19-related disruptions to merck's revenue for the full year 2021 was approximately $1.3 billion, attributable to the pharmaceutical segment.
merck believes that global health systems and patients have largely adapted to the impacts of covid-19, however, roughly 75% of merck's pharmaceutical segment revenue is comprised of physician-administered products which could be adversely affected by the pandemic if its effects worsen. despite the company's efforts to manage the impacts of the covid-19 pandemic, their ultimate effect will also depend on factors beyond the company's knowledge or control, including the duration of the covid-19 pandemic as well as governmental and third-party actions taken to contain or prevent the spread and treatment of the virus and mitigate its public health and economic effects. in addition, any future pandemic, epidemic or similar public health threat could present similar risks to the company's business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
the company has significant global operations, which expose it to additional risks, and any adverse event could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations and financial condition.
the extent of the company's operations outside the u.s. is significant. risks inherent in conducting a global business include:
•changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs and pricing restrictions in key markets;
•multiple regulatory requirements that could restrict the company's ability to manufacture and sell its products in key markets;
•trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements, including the imposition of trade sanctions or similar restrictions by the u.s. or other governments;
•foreign exchange fluctuations;
•diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries; and in addition, there may be changes to the company's business and political position if there is instability, disruption or destruction in a significant geographic region, regardless of cause, including war, terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest; and natural or man-made disasters, including famine, flood, fire, earthquake, storm or disease. in particular, in february 2022, armed conflict escalated between russia and ukraine. it is not possible to predict the broader consequences of this conflict, which could include sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, geopolitical shifts and adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, currency exchange rates and financial markets.
table of contents climate change or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect the company's business, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.
the company believes that climate change has the potential to negatively affect its business and results of operations, cash flows and prospects. the company is exposed to physical risks (such as extreme weather conditions or rising sea levels), risks in transitioning to a low-carbon economy (such as additional legal or regulatory requirements, changes in technology, market risk and reputational risk) and social and human effects (such as population dislocations and harm to health and well-being) associated with climate change. these risks can be either acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term).
the adverse impacts of climate change include increased frequency and severity of natural disasters and extreme weather events such as hurricanes, tornados, wildfires (exacerbated by drought), flooding, and extreme heat. extreme weather and sea-level rise pose physical risks to the company's facilities as well as those of its suppliers. such risks include losses incurred as a result of physical damage to facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory, and business interruption caused by such natural disasters and extreme weather events. other potential physical impacts due to climate change include reduced access to high-quality water in certain regions and the loss of biodiversity, which could impact future product development. these risks could disrupt the company's operations and its supply chain, which may result in increased costs.
new legal or regulatory requirements may be enacted to prevent, mitigate, or adapt to the implications of a changing climate and its effects on the environment. these regulations, which may differ across jurisdictions, could result in the company being subject to new or expanded carbon pricing or taxes, increased compliance costs, restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions, investment in new technologies, increased carbon disclosure and transparency, upgrade of facilities to meet new building codes, and the redesign of utility systems, which could increase the company's operating costs, including the cost of electricity and energy used by the company. the company's supply chain would likely be subject to these same transitional risks and would likely pass along any increased costs to the company.
environmental, social and governance (esg) matters may impact the company's business and reputation.
governmental authorities, non-governmental organizations, customers, investors, external stakeholders and employees are increasingly sensitive to esg concerns, such as diversity and inclusion, climate change, water use, recyclability or recoverability of packaging, and plastic waste. this focus on esg concerns may lead to new requirements that could result in increased costs associated with developing, manufacturing and distributing the company's products. the company's ability to compete could also be affected by changing customer preferences and requirements, such as growing demand for more environmentally friendly products, packaging or supplier practices, or by failure to meet such customer expectations or demand. while the company strives to improve its esg performance, the company risks negative stockholder reaction, including from proxy advisory services, as well as damage to its brand and reputation, if the company does not act responsibly, or if the company is perceived to not be acting responsibly in key esg areas, including equitable access to medicines and vaccines, product quality and safety, diversity and inclusion, environmental stewardship, support for local communities, corporate governance and transparency, and addressing human capital factors in the company's operations. if the company does not meet the esg expectations of its investors, customers and other stakeholders, the company could experience reduced demand for its products, loss of customers, and other negative impacts on the company's business and results of operations.
failure to attract and retain highly qualified personnel could affect the company's ability to successfully develop and commercialize products.
the company's success is largely dependent on its continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific, technical and management personnel, as well as personnel with expertise in clinical research and development, governmental regulation and commercialization. competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical industry, both in the u.s. and internationally, is intense. the company cannot be sure that it will be able to attract and retain quality personnel or that the costs of doing so will not materially increase.
table of contents the company may experience difficulties and delays in manufacturing certain of its products, including vaccines.
merck has, in the past, experienced difficulties in manufacturing certain of its products, including vaccines. for example, in 2020 the company issued a product recall for zerbaxa following the identification of product sterility issues. the company may, in the future, experience other difficulties and delays in manufacturing its products, such as (i) failure of the company or any of its vendors or suppliers to comply with current good manufacturing practices and other applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines that could lead to manufacturing shutdowns, product shortages and delays in product manufacturing; (ii) delays related to the construction of new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities, including those intended to support future demand for the company's products; and (iii) other manufacturing or distribution problems including supply chain delays, shortages in raw materials, changes in manufacturing production sites and limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements, changes in types of products produced, or physical limitations that could impact continuous supply. in addition, the company could experience difficulties or delays in manufacturing its products caused by natural disasters, such as hurricanes. manufacturing difficulties can result in product shortages, leading to lost sales and reputational harm to the company.
the company may not be able to realize the expected benefits of its investments in emerging markets.
the company has been taking steps to increase its sales in emerging markets. however, there is no guarantee that the company's efforts to expand sales in these markets will succeed. some countries within emerging markets may be especially vulnerable to periods of global financial instability or may have very limited resources to spend on health care. in order for the company to successfully implement its emerging markets strategy, it must attract and retain qualified personnel. the company may also be required to increase its reliance on third-party agents within less developed markets, which may affect its ability to realize continued growth and may also increase the company's risk exposure. in addition, many of these countries have currencies that fluctuate substantially and, if such currencies devalue and the company cannot offset the devaluations, the company's financial performance within such countries could be adversely affected.
the company's business in china has grown rapidly in the past few years, and the importance of china to the company's overall pharmaceutical and vaccines business outside the u.s. has increased accordingly. continued growth of the company's business in china is dependent upon ongoing development of a favorable environment for innovative pharmaceutical products and vaccines, sustained access for the company's currently marketed products, and the absence of trade impediments or adverse pricing controls. as noted above in "competition and the health care environment," pricing pressure in china has increased as the chinese government has been taking steps to reduce costs, including implementing health care reform that has led to the acceleration of generic substitution, where available. while the mechanism for drugs being added to the nrdl evolves, inclusion may require a price negotiation which could impact the outlook in the market for selected brands. in 2021, drugs were added to the nrdl with an average of more than 60% price reductions. while pricing pressure has always existed in china, health care reform has increased this pressure in part due to the acceleration of generic substitution through the government's vbp program. in 2019, the government implemented the vbp program through a tendering process for mature products which have generic substitutes with a generic quality consistency evaluation approval. mature products that have entered into the last five rounds of vbp had, on average, a price reduction of more than 50%. the company expects vbp to be a semi-annual process that will have a significant impact on mature products moving forward. in addition, the company anticipates that the reported inquiries made by various governmental authorities involving multinational pharmaceutical companies in china may continue.
for all these reasons, sales within emerging markets carry significant risks. however, at the same time macro-economic growth of selected emerging markets is expected to outpace europe and even the u.s., leading to significant increased health care spending in those countries and access to innovative medicines for patients. a failure to maintain the company's presence in emerging markets could therefore have a material adverse effect on the company's business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
table of contents the company is exposed to market risk from fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates.
the company operates in multiple jurisdictions and virtually all sales are denominated in currencies of the local jurisdiction. additionally, the company has entered and will enter into business development transactions, borrowings or other financial transactions that may give rise to currency and interest rate exposure.
since the company cannot, with certainty, foresee and mitigate against such adverse fluctuations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, interest rates and inflation could negatively affect the company's business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
in order to mitigate against the adverse impact of these market fluctuations, the company will from time to time enter into hedging agreements. while hedging agreements, such as currency options and forwards and interest rate swaps, may limit some of the exposure to exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, such attempts to mitigate these risks may be costly and not always successful.
certain of the company's interest rate derivatives and investments are based on the london interbank offered rate (libor), and a portion of merck's indebtedness bears interest at variable interest rates, primarily based on libor. libor is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform, which will cause libor to cease to exist entirely in the future. while the company has begun to implement alternative reference rates as alternatives to libor, the company cannot predict the consequences and timing of any additional or unexpected developments, which could include an increase in interest expense and will also require the amendment of contracts that reference libor.
pharmaceutical products can develop unexpected safety or efficacy concerns.
unexpected safety or efficacy concerns can arise with respect to marketed products, whether or not scientifically justified, leading to product recalls, withdrawals, or declining sales, as well as product liability, consumer fraud and/or other claims, including potential civil or criminal governmental actions.
reliance on third-party relationships and outsourcing arrangements could materially adversely affect the company's business.
the company depends on third parties, including suppliers, alliances with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and third-party service providers, for key aspects of its business including development, manufacture and commercialization of its products and support for its information technology (it) systems. failure of these third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory and other obligations to the company or the development of factors that materially disrupt the relationships between the company and these third parties could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.
negative events in the animal health industry could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations and financial condition.
future sales of key animal health products could be adversely affected by a number of risk factors including certain risks that are specific to the animal health business. for example, the outbreak of disease carried by animals, such as african swine fever, could lead to their widespread death and precautionary destruction as well as the reduced consumption and demand for animals, which could adversely affect the company's results of operations. also, the outbreak of any highly contagious diseases near the company's main production sites could require the company to immediately halt the manufacture of its animal health products at such sites or force the company to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere. other risks specific to animal health include epidemics and pandemics, government procurement and pricing practices, weather and global agribusiness economic events. in addition, sales of bravecto represent a significant portion of the company's animal health segment sales. any negative event with respect to bravecto could have a material adverse effect on the company's animal health sales. as the animal health segment of the company's business becomes more significant, the impact of any such events on future results of operations would also become more significant.
table of contents biologics and vaccines carry unique risks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's future results of operations and financial condition.
the successful development, testing, manufacturing and commercialization of biologics and vaccines, particularly human and animal health vaccines, is a long, complex, expensive and uncertain process. there are unique risks and uncertainties related to biologics and vaccines, including:
•there may be limited access to, and supply of, normal and diseased tissue samples, cell lines, pathogens, bacteria, viral strains and other biological materials. in addition, government regulations in multiple jurisdictions, such as the u.s. and the eu, could result in restricted access to, or transport or use of, such materials. if the company loses access to sufficient sources of such materials, or if tighter restrictions are imposed on the use of such materials, the company may not be able to conduct research activities as planned and may incur additional development costs.
•the development, manufacturing and marketing of biologics and vaccines are subject to regulation by the fda, the ema and other regulatory bodies. these regulations are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products. for example, in the u.s., a bla, including both pre-clinical and clinical trial data and extensive data regarding the manufacturing procedures, is required for human vaccine candidates, and fda approval is generally required for the release of each manufactured commercial human vaccine lot.
•manufacturing biologics and vaccines, especially in large quantities, is often complex and may require the use of innovative technologies to handle living micro-organisms. each lot of an approved biologic and vaccine must undergo thorough testing for identity, strength, quality, purity and potency. manufacturing biologics requires facilities specifically designed for and validated for this purpose, and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures are necessary. slight deviations anywhere in the manufacturing process, including filling, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping and quality control and testing, may result in lot failures, product recalls or spoilage. when changes are made to the manufacturing process, the company may be required to provide pre-clinical and clinical data showing the comparable identity, strength, quality, purity or potency of the products before and after such changes.
•biologics and vaccines are frequently costly to manufacture because production ingredients are derived from living animal or plant material, and most biologics and vaccines cannot be made synthetically. in particular, keeping up with the demand for vaccines may be difficult due to the complexity of producing vaccines.
•the use of biologically derived ingredients can lead to variability in the manufacturing process and could lead to allegations of harm, including infections or allergic reactions, which allegations would be reviewed through a standard investigation process that could lead to closure of product facilities due to possible contamination. any of these events could result in substantial costs.
risks relating to government regulation and legal proceedings the health care industry in the u.s. has been, and will continue to be, subject to increasing regulation and political action.
as discussed above in "competition and the health care environment," the company believes that the health care industry will continue to be subject to increasing regulation as well as political and legal action, as future proposals to reform the health care system are considered by the executive branch, congress and state legislatures.
in 2016, the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms) issued the medicaid rebate final rule that implemented provisions of the aca effective april 1, 2016. the rule provides comprehensive guidance on the calculation of average manufacturer price and best price; two metrics utilized to determine the rebates drug manufacturers are required to pay to state medicaid programs. on december 21, 2020, the cms issued a final rule making significant changes to these requirements. effective january 1, 2023, this final rule also changes the way that manufacturers must calculate best price, in relation to certain patient support programs, including coupons. phrma, a pharmaceutical industry trade group, of which the company is a member, filed a complaint challenging this rule as invalid asserting that it conflicts with the plain language of the medicaid drug rebate statute. should this legal table of contents challenge fail, the impact of this and other provisions in this final rule could adversely impact the company's business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
in 2021, congress passed the american rescue plan act of 2021, which included a provision that eliminates the statutory cap on rebates drug manufacturers pay to medicaid beginning in january 2024. these rebates act as a discount off the list price and eliminating the cap means that manufacturer discounts paid to medicaid can increase. prior to this change, manufacturers have not been required to pay more than 100% of the average manufacturer price (amp) in rebates to state medicaid programs for medicaid-covered drugs. as a result of this provision, beginning in 2024, it is possible that manufacturers may have to pay state medicaid programs more in rebates than they received on sales of particular products. this change could present a risk to merck in the future for drugs that have high medicaid utilization and rebate exposure that is more than 100% of the amp.
in the u.s., the biden administration and congress continue to discuss legislation designed to control health care costs, including the cost of drugs. the company cannot predict what additional future changes in the health care industry in general, or the pharmaceutical industry in particular, will occur; however, any changes could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.
the company's products, including products in development, cannot be marketed unless the company obtains and maintains regulatory approval.
the company's activities, including research, pre-clinical testing, clinical trials and the manufacturing and marketing of its products, are subject to extensive regulation by numerous federal, state and local governmental authorities in the u.s., including the fda, and by foreign regulatory authorities, including in the eu, japan and china. in the u.s., the fda administers requirements covering the testing, approval, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling and marketing of prescription pharmaceuticals. in some cases, the fda requirements have increased the amount of time and resources necessary to develop new products and bring them to market in the u.s. regulation outside the u.s. also is primarily focused on drug safety and effectiveness and, in many cases, reduction in the cost of drugs. the fda and foreign regulatory authorities, including in the eu, japan and china, have substantial discretion to require additional testing, to delay or withhold registration and marketing approval and to otherwise preclude distribution and sale of a product.
even if the company is successful in developing new products, it will not be able to market any of those products unless and until it has obtained all required regulatory approvals in each jurisdiction where it proposes to market the new products. once obtained, the company must maintain approval as long as it plans to market its new products in each jurisdiction where approval is required. the company's failure to obtain approval, significant delays in the approval process, or its failure to maintain approval in any jurisdiction will prevent it from selling the products in that jurisdiction. the company would not be able to realize revenues for those new products in any jurisdiction where it does not have approval.
developments following regulatory approval may adversely affect sales of the company's products.
even after a product reaches the market, certain developments following regulatory approval may decrease demand for the company's products, including the following:
•the re-review of products that are already marketed;
•the recall or loss of marketing approval of products that are already marketed;
•changing government standards or public expectations regarding safety, efficacy, quality or labeling changes;
•scrutiny of advertising and promotion; and
•the withdrawal of indications granted pursuant to accelerated approvals.
in the past, clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance of certain marketed drugs of the company and of competitors within the industry have raised concerns that have led to recalls, withdrawals or adverse labeling of table of contents marketed products. clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance of certain marketed drugs also have raised concerns among some prescribers and patients relating to the safety or efficacy of pharmaceutical products in general that have negatively affected the sales of such products. in addition, increased scrutiny of the outcomes of clinical trials has led to increased volatility in market reaction. further, these matters often attract litigation and, even where the basis for the litigation is groundless, considerable resources may be needed to respond.
in addition, following in the wake of product withdrawals and other significant safety issues, health authorities such as the fda, the ema, japan's pmda and china's nmpa have increased their focus on safety when assessing the benefit/risk balance of drugs. some health authorities appear to have become more cautious when making decisions about approvability of new products or indications.
if previously unknown side effects are discovered or if there is an increase in negative publicity regarding known side effects of any of the company's products, it could significantly reduce demand for the product or require the company to take actions that could negatively affect sales, including removing the product from the market, restricting its distribution or applying for labeling changes. further, in the current environment in which all pharmaceutical companies operate, the company is at risk for product liability and consumer protection claims and civil and criminal governmental actions related to its products, research and/or marketing activities. in addition, dissemination of promotional materials through evolving digital channels serves to increase visibility and scrutiny in the marketplace.
the company is subject to a variety of u.s. and international laws and regulations.
the company is currently subject to a number of government laws and regulations and, in the future, could become subject to new government laws and regulations. the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations, or the negative results of non-compliance, could adversely affect the business, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition and prospects of the company; these laws and regulations include (i) additional health care reform initiatives in the u.s. or in other countries, including additional mandatory discounts or fees; (ii) the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act or other anti-bribery and corruption laws; (iii) new laws, regulations and judicial or other governmental decisions affecting pricing, drug reimbursement, and access or marketing within or across jurisdictions; (iv) changes in intellectual property laws; (v) changes in accounting standards; (vi) new and increasing data privacy regulations and enforcement, particularly in the eu, the u.s., and china; (vii) legislative mandates or preferences for local manufacturing of pharmaceutical or vaccine products; (viii) emerging and new global regulatory requirements for reporting payments and other value transfers to health care professionals; (ix) environmental regulations; and (x) the potential impact of importation restrictions, embargoes, trade sanctions and legislative and/or other regulatory changes.
the company is subject to evolving and complex tax laws, which may result in additional liabilities that may affect results of operations and financial condition.
the company is subject to evolving and complex tax laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates. significant judgment is required for determining the company's tax liabilities, and the company's tax returns are routinely examined by various tax authorities. in connection with the 2015 organization for economic cooperation and development (oecd) base erosion and profit shifting project, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. the company believes that its accrual for tax contingencies is adequate for all open years based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of tax contingencies, the ultimate resolution of any tax matters may result in payments greater or less than amounts accrued. in addition, the company may be negatively affected by changes in tax laws, or new tax laws, affecting, for example, tax rates, and/or revised tax law interpretations in domestic or foreign jurisdictions, including, among others, any potential changes to the existing u.s. tax law by the current u.s. presidential administration and congress, as well as any changes in tax law resulting from the implementation of the oecd's two-pillar solution to reform the international tax landscape.
the company has taken the position, based on the opinions of tax counsel, that its distribution of organon common stock in connection with the 2021 spin-off of organon qualifies as a transaction that is tax-free for u.s. federal income tax purposes. if any facts, assumptions, representations, and undertakings from the company and organon regarding the past and future conduct of their respective businesses and other matters are table of contents incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, the spin-off may not qualify for tax-free treatment, which could result in significant u.s. federal income tax liabilities for the company and its shareholders.
adverse outcomes in current or future legal matters could negatively affect merck's business.
current or future litigation, claims, proceedings and government investigations could preclude or delay the commercialization of merck's products or could adversely affect merck's business, results of operations, cash flow, prospects and financial condition. such legal matters may include, but are not limited to: (i) intellectual property disputes; (ii) adverse decisions in litigation, including product safety and liability, consumer protection and commercial cases; (iii) anti-bribery regulations, such as the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, including compliance with ongoing reporting obligations to the government resulting from any settlements; (iv) recalls or withdrawals of pharmaceutical products or forced closings of manufacturing plants; (v) product pricing and promotional matters; (vi) lawsuits, claims and administrative proceedings asserting, or investigations into, violations of securities, antitrust, federal and state pricing, consumer protection, data privacy and other laws and regulations; (vii) environmental, health, safety and sustainability matters, including regulatory actions in response to climate change; and (viii) tax liabilities resulting from assessments from tax authorities. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data," note 11, "contingencies and environmental liabilities" for more information on the company's legal matters.
in 2021, merck informed the u.s. department of health and human services, health resources and services administration (hhs) that merck was implementing an update to its section 340b program integrity initiative, pursuant to which merck required all hospital covered entities to provide 340b claims data for all claims originating from contract pharmacies. for those entities that declined to submit such claims data, merck's new initiative provided that it would no longer voluntarily honor 340b discounts or chargebacks for contract pharmacy transactions, except for a single contract pharmacy of the hospital covered entity's choice.
also in 2021, hhs sent letters to numerous drug manufacturers stating that it had determined that those manufacturers' actions restricting contract pharmacy transactions were in violation of the 340b statute and further stating that if those manufacturers did not cease their restrictions, hhs might seek both repayment of overcharges as well as civil monetary penalties. those manufacturers are now in litigation with the u.s. government seeking to confirm the legality of the restrictions.
merck did not receive a similar letter from hhs. however, hhs could seek to implement administrative proceedings to recover overcharges and/or impose civil monetary penalties against merck. if such proceedings were implemented against merck a negative outcome could have a material adverse effect on merck's business, results of operations, cash flow, prospects and financial condition.
as a result of a number of factors, product liability insurance has become less available while the cost of such insurance has increased significantly. the company is subject to a substantial number of product liability claims. see item 8. "financial statements and supplementary data," note 11. "contingencies and environmental liabilities" below for more information on the company's current product liability litigation. with respect to product liability, the company self-insures substantially all of its risk, as the availability of commercial insurance has become more restrictive. the company has evaluated its risks and has determined that the cost of obtaining product liability insurance outweighs the likely benefits of the coverage that is available and, as such, has no insurance for most product liabilities. the company will continually assess the most efficient means to address its risk; however, there can be no guarantee that insurance coverage will be obtained or, if obtained, will be sufficient to fully cover product liabilities that may arise.
risks related to technology the company is increasingly dependent on sophisticated software applications and computing infrastructure. in 2017, the company experienced a network cyber-attack that led to a disruption of its worldwide operations, including manufacturing, research and sales operations. the company could be a target of future cyber-attacks.
the company is increasingly dependent on sophisticated software applications, complex information technology systems, computing infrastructure, and cloud service providers (collectively, it systems) to conduct table of contents critical operations. certain of these systems are managed, hosted, provided or used by third parties to assist in conducting the company's business. disruption, degradation, or manipulation of these it systems through intentional or accidental means by the company's employees, third parties with authorized access or unauthorized third parties could adversely affect key business processes. cyber-attacks against the company's it systems or third-party providers' it systems, such as cloud-based systems, could result in exposure of confidential information, the modification of critical data, and/or the failure of critical operations. misuse of any of these it systems could result in the disclosure of sensitive personal information or the theft of trade secrets, intellectual property, or other confidential business information. the company continues to leverage new and innovative technologies across the enterprise to improve the efficacy and efficiency of its business processes, including data acquisition; the use of which can create new risks.
in 2017, the company experienced a network cyber-attack that led to a disruption of its worldwide operations, including manufacturing, research and sales operations, and resulting losses.
the company has implemented a variety of measures to further enhance and modernize its systems to guard against similar attacks in the future, and also is pursuing an enterprise-wide effort to enhance the company's resiliency against future cyber-attacks, including incidents similar to the 2017 attack. the objective of these efforts is not only to protect against future cyber-attacks, but also to improve the speed of the company's recovery from such attacks and enable continued business operations to the greatest extent possible during any recovery period.
although the aggregate impact of cyber-attacks and network disruptions, including the 2017 cyber-attack, on the company's operations and financial condition has not been material to date, the company continues to be a target of events of this nature and expects them to continue. the company monitors its data, information technology and personnel usage of company it systems to reduce these risks and continues to do so on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats. there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to protect its data and it systems or the efforts of third-party providers to protect their it systems will be successful in preventing disruptions to the company's operations, including its manufacturing, research and sales operations. such disruptions have in the past and could in the future result in loss of revenue, or the loss of critical or sensitive information from the company's or the company's third-party providers' databases or it systems and have in the past and could in the future also result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm to the company and substantial remediation costs.
social media and mobile messaging platforms present risks and challenges.
the inappropriate and/or unauthorized use of certain social media and mobile messaging channels could cause brand damage or information leakage or could lead to legal implications, including from the improper collection and/or dissemination of personally identifiable information. in addition, negative or inaccurate posts or comments about the company or its products on any social networking platforms could damage the company's reputation, brand image and goodwill. further, the disclosure of non-public company-sensitive information by the company's workforce or others through external media channels could lead to information loss. although there are internal company social media and mobile messaging policies that guide employees on appropriate personal and professional use of these platforms for communication about the company, the processes in place may not completely secure and protect information. identifying new points of entry as new communication tools expand also presents new challenges.
cautionary factors that may affect future results
(cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995)
this report and other written reports and oral statements made from time to time by the company may contain so-called "forward-looking statements," all of which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause results to differ materially from those set forth in the statements. one can identify these forward-looking statements by their use of words such as "anticipates," "expects," "plans," "will," "estimates," "forecasts," "projects" and other words of similar meaning, or negative variations of any of the foregoing. one can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. these statements are likely to address the company's growth strategy, financial results, product approvals, product potential, development programs, environmental or other sustainability initiatives, and include table of contents statements related to the expected impact of the covid-19 pandemic. one must carefully consider any such statement and should understand that many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the company's forward-looking statements. these factors include inaccurate assumptions and a broad variety of other risks and uncertainties, including some that are known and some that are not. no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual future results may vary materially. the company does not assume the obligation to update any forward-looking statement. the company cautions you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. although it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors, they may include the following:
•increased "brand" competition in therapeutic areas important to the company's long-term business performance.
•the difficulties and uncertainties inherent in new product development. the outcome of the lengthy and complex process of new product development is inherently uncertain. a drug candidate can fail at any stage of the process and one or more late-stage product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval. new product candidates may appear promising in development but fail to reach the market because of efficacy or safety concerns, the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, the difficulty or excessive cost to manufacture and/or the infringement of patents or intellectual property rights of others. furthermore, the sales of new products may prove to be disappointing and fail to reach anticipated levels.
•pricing pressures, both in the u.s. and abroad, including rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to medicare, medicaid and health care reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement and pricing in general.
•the impact of the global covid-19 pandemic and any future pandemic, epidemic, or similar public health threat, on the company's business, operations and financial performance.
•changes in government laws and regulations, including laws governing intellectual property, and the enforcement thereof affecting the company's business.
•efficacy or safety concerns with respect to marketed products, whether or not scientifically justified, leading to product recalls, withdrawals or declining sales.
•significant changes in customer relationships or changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing health care insurance coverage.
•legal factors, including product liability claims, antitrust litigation and governmental investigations, including tax disputes, environmental concerns and patent disputes with branded and generic competitors, any of which could preclude commercialization of products or negatively affect the profitability of existing products.
•cyber-attacks on the company's or third-party providers' information technology systems, which could disrupt the company's operations.
•lost market opportunity resulting from delays and uncertainties in the approval process of the fda and foreign regulatory authorities.
•increased focus on privacy issues in countries around the world, including the u.s., the eu, and china. the legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect directly the company's business, including recently enacted laws in a majority of states in the u.s. requiring security breach notification.
•changes in tax laws including changes related to the taxation of foreign earnings.
•changes in accounting pronouncements promulgated by standard-setting or regulatory bodies, including the financial accounting standards board and the sec, that are adverse to the company.
•economic factors over which the company has no control, including changes in inflation, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
this list should not be considered an exhaustive statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. see "risk factors" above.
item 7.management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
description of merck's business merck & co., inc. (merck or the company) is a global health care company that delivers innovative health solutions through its prescription medicines, vaccines, biologic therapies and animal health products. the company's operations are principally managed on a products basis and include two operating segments, which are the pharmaceutical and animal health segments, both of which are reportable segments.
the pharmaceutical segment includes human health pharmaceutical and vaccine products. human health pharmaceutical products consist of therapeutic and preventive agents, generally sold by prescription, for the treatment of human disorders. the company sells these human health pharmaceutical products primarily to drug wholesalers and retailers, hospitals, government agencies and managed health care providers such as health maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefit managers and other institutions. human health vaccine products consist of preventive pediatric, adolescent and adult vaccines. the company sells these human health vaccines primarily to physicians, wholesalers, physician distributors and government entities.
the animal health segment discovers, develops, manufactures and markets a wide range of veterinary pharmaceutical and vaccine products, as well as health management solutions and services, for the prevention, treatment and control of disease in all major livestock and companion animal species. the company also offers an extensive suite of digitally connected identification, traceability and monitoring products. the company sells its products to veterinarians, distributors and animal producers.
the company previously had a healthcare services segment that provided services and solutions focused on engagement, health analytics and clinical services to improve the value of care delivered to patients. the company divested the remaining businesses in this segment during the first quarter of 2020.
spin-off of organon & co.
on june 2, 2021, merck completed the spin-off of products from its women's health, biosimilars and established brands businesses into a new, independent, publicly traded company named organon & co. (organon) through a distribution of organon's publicly traded stock to company shareholders. the distribution is expected to qualify and has been treated as tax-free to the company and its shareholders for u.s. federal income tax purposes. the established brands included in the transaction consisted of dermatology, non-opioid pain management, respiratory, select cardiovascular products, as well as the rest of merck's diversified brands franchise. merck's existing research pipeline programs continue to be owned and developed within merck as planned. the historical results of the businesses that were contributed to organon in the spin-off have been reflected as discontinued operations in the company's consolidated financial statements through the date of the spin-off (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements).

executive summary during 2021, merck delivered on its strategic priorities by executing commercially to drive strong revenue and earnings growth in the year, completing key business development transactions, accelerating its broad pipeline, and achieving notable regulatory milestones. also, on june 2, 2021, merck completed the spin-off of organon. the historical results of the businesses that were contributed to organon in the spin-off have been reflected as discontinued operations in the company's consolidated financial statements through the date of the spin-off.
worldwide sales were $48.7 billion in 2021, an increase of 17% compared with 2020, or 16% excluding the favorable effect of foreign exchange. the sales increase was driven primarily by growth in oncology, vaccines, hospital acute care and animal health. additionally, revenue in 2021 reflects the benefit of sales of molnupiravir, an investigational oral antiviral covid-19 treatment. as discussed below, covid-19-related disruptions negatively affected sales in 2021, but to a lesser extent than in 2020, which benefited year-over-year sales growth.
merck continues to execute scientifically compelling business development opportunities to augment its pipeline. in november 2021, merck acquired acceleron pharma inc. (acceleron), a publicly traded biopharmaceutical company evaluating the transforming growth factor (tgf)-beta superfamily of proteins through the development of pulmonary and hematologic therapies. in april 2021, merck acquired pandion therapeutics, inc. (pandion), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel therapeutics designed to address the unmet needs of patients living with autoimmune diseases. additionally, merck entered into a collaboration with gilead sciences, inc. (gilead) to jointly develop and commercialize long-acting treatments in hiv.
in 2021, merck received over 30 approvals and filed over 20 new drug applications (ndas) and supplemental biologics license applications (blas) across the u.s., the eu, japan and china. during 2021, the company received numerous regulatory approvals within oncology. keytruda received approval for additional indications in the u.s. and/or internationally as monotherapy in the therapeutic areas of breast, colorectal, cutaneous squamous cell, esophageal, melanoma and renal cell cancers, as well as in combination with chemotherapy in the therapeutic areas of breast, cervical, gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancers. keytruda was also approved in combination with lenvima both for the treatment of certain adult patients with endometrial cancer and for the treatment of renal cell cancer. lenvima is being developed in collaboration with eisai co., ltd. (eisai). lynparza, which is being developed in collaboration with astrazeneca plc (astrazeneca), received approval in china as monotherapy for the treatment of certain adult patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. additionally, the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) approved welireg (belzutifan), an oral hypoxia-inducible factor-2 alpha (hif-2α) inhibitor, for the treatment of adult patients with von hippel-lindau (vhl)
table of contents disease who require therapy for associated renal cell carcinoma (rcc), central nervous system hemangioblastomas, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, not requiring immediate surgery.
also in 2021, as updated in february 2022, the fda granted emergency use authorization (eua) for molnupiravir, an investigational oral antiviral covid-19 treatment being developed in a collaboration with ridgeback biotherapuetics lp (ridgeback). molnupiravir also received conditional marketing authorization in the united kingdom (uk) and special approval for emergency in japan. also in 2021, the fda and the european commission (ec) approved vaxneuvance (pneumococcal 15-valent conjugate vaccine), a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for use in adults. additionally, verquvo, a medicine to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization following a hospitalization for heart failure or need for outpatient intravenous diuretics in adults was approved in the u.s., the eu and japan. verquvo is being jointly developed with bayer ag (bayer). in january 2022, the japan ministry of health, labor and welfare (mhlw) approved lyfnua (gefapixant) for adults with refractory or unexplained chronic cough.
keytruda is under review in the u.s. and/or internationally for supplemental indications for the treatment of certain patients with triple negative breast, cervical, endometrial, melanoma, renal cell and tumor mutation burden-high (tmbh) cancers. lynparza is under review for supplemental indications for the treatment of certain patients with breast and prostate cancers. lenvima is under review in combination with keytruda for a supplemental indication for the treatment of certain patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). mk-4482, molnupiravir, is under a rolling review by the european medicines agency (ema); mk-7264, gefapixant, a selective, non-narcotic, orally-administered, investigational p2x3-receptor antagonist being developed for the treatment of refractory, chronic cough is under review in the u.s. and the eu; and vaxneuvance (v114), a 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, is under priority review by the fda for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease in pediatric patients. v114 is also under review in japan for use in adults.

•mk-4482, molnupiravir, which is reflected in phase 3 development in the u.s. as it remains investigational following eua.
the company is allocating resources to support its commercial opportunities in the near term while investing heavily in research to support future innovations and long-term growth. research and development expenses in 2021 reflect higher clinical development spending and increased investment in discovery research and early drug development.
in november 2021, merck's board of directors approved an increase to the company's quarterly dividend, raising it to $0.69 per share from $0.65 per share on the company's outstanding common stock. during 2021, the company returned $7.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
in december 2021, the company completed its inaugural issuance of a $1.0 billion sustainability bond, which was part of an $8.0 billion underwritten bond offering. the company intends to use the net proceeds from the sustainability bond offering to support projects and partnerships in the company's priority environmental, social and governance (esg) areas and contribute to the advancement of the united nations sustainable development goals.
covid-19 update during the covid-19 pandemic merck has remained focused on protecting the safety of its employees, ensuring that its supply of medicines and vaccines reaches its patients, contributing its scientific expertise to the development of an antiviral therapy, supporting efforts to expand manufacturing capacity and supply of sars-cov-2/covid-19 medicines and vaccines (see below), and supporting health care providers and merck's communities. although covid-19-related disruptions negatively affected results in 2021 and 2020, merck continues to experience strong global underlying demand across its business.
in 2021, merck's sales were unfavorably affected by covid-19-related disruptions, which resulted in an estimated negative impact to merck's pharmaceutical segment sales of approximately $1.3 billion. roughly 75% of merck's pharmaceutical segment revenue is comprised of physician-administered products, which, despite strong underlying demand, have been affected by social distancing measures and fewer well visits. merck's sales were favorably affected by the authorization of molnupiravir in several markets as discussed further below, which resulted in sales of $952 million in 2021. in 2020, the estimated negative impact of covid-19-related disruptions to merck's sales was approximately $2.1 billion, of which approximately $2.0 billion was attributable to the pharmaceutical segment and approximately $50 million was attributable to the animal health segment.
in april 2021, merck announced it was discontinuing the development of mk-7110 (formerly known as cd24fc) for the treatment of hospitalized patients with covid-19, which was obtained as part of merck's acquisition of oncoimmune (see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). this decision resulted in charges of $207 million to cost of sales in 2021. in january 2021, the company announced the discontinuation of the development programs for its covid-19 vaccine candidates, v590 and v591, following merck's review of findings from phase 1 clinical studies for the vaccines. in these studies, both v590 and v591 were generally well tolerated, but the immune responses were inferior to those seen following natural infection and those reported for other sars-cov-2/covid-19 vaccines. due to the discontinuation, the company recorded a charge of $305 million in 2020, of which $260 million was reflected in cost of sales and the remaining $45 million of costs were reflected in research and development expenses.
operating expenses reflect a minor positive effect in 2021 as investments in covid-19-related research largely offset the favorable impact of lower spending in other areas due to the covid-19 pandemic. operating expenses were positively affected in 2020 by approximately $500 million primarily due to lower promotional and selling costs, as well as lower research and development expenses, net of investments in covid-19-related antiviral and vaccine research programs. in addition, the covid-19 pandemic has caused some disruption and volatility in the company's global supply chain network, and the company may in the future experience disruptions in availability and delays in shipments of raw materials and packaging, as well as related cost inflation.
in december 2021, the fda granted eua for molnupiravir based on positive results from the phase 3 move-out clinical trial. additionally, in december 2021, japan's mhlw granted special approval for table of contents emergency for molnupiravir. in november 2021, the uk medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency granted conditional marketing authorization for molnupiravir. in addition, in october 2021, the ema initiated a rolling review for molnupiravir. merck plans to work with the committee for medicinal products for human use of the ema to complete the rolling review process to facilitate initiating the formal review of the marketing authorization application. merck is developing molnupiravir in collaboration with ridgeback. the companies are actively working with other regulatory agencies worldwide to submit applications for emergency use or marketing authorization. merck has entered into advance purchase and supply agreements for molnupiravir in more than 30 markets. see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the collaboration with ridgeback.
in march 2021, merck announced it had entered into multiple agreements to support efforts to expand manufacturing capacity and supply of sars-cov-2/covid-19 medicines and vaccines. the biomedical advanced research and development authority (barda), a division of the office of the assistant secretary for preparedness and response within the u.s. department of health and human services, is providing merck with funding to adapt and make available a number of existing manufacturing facilities for the production of sars-cov-2/covid-19 vaccines and medicines. merck has also entered into agreements to support the manufacturing and supply of johnson & johnson's sars-cov-2/covid-19 vaccine. merck is using certain of its facilities in the u.s. to produce drug substance, formulate and fill vials of johnson & johnson's vaccine.
pricing global efforts toward health care cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing and market access worldwide. changes to the u.s. health care system as part of health care reform enacted in prior years, as well as increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of medicare, medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, have contributed to pricing pressure. in several international markets, government-mandated pricing actions have reduced prices of generic and patented drugs. in addition, the company's revenue performance in 2021 was negatively affected by other cost-reduction measures taken by governments and other third parties to lower health care costs. in the u.s., the biden administration and congress continue to discuss legislation designed to control health care costs, including the cost of drugs. the company anticipates all of these actions and additional actions in the future will continue to negatively affect revenue performance.

worldwide sales grew 17% in 2021 primarily due to higher sales in the oncology franchise largely driven by strong growth of keytruda and increased alliance revenue from lynparza and lenvima, as well as higher sales in the vaccines franchise, primarily attributable to growth in gardasil/gardasil 9, varivax and proquad. also contributing to revenue growth in 2021 were higher sales in the virology franchise attributable to molnupiravir, higher sales in the hospital acute care franchise, reflecting growth in bridion and prevymis, as well as higher sales of animal health products. additionally, sales in 2021 benefited from higher third-party manufacturing sales and the achievement of milestones for an out-licensed product that triggered contingent payments to merck. as discussed above, covid-19-related disruptions unfavorably affected sales in 2021, but to a lesser extent than in 2020, which benefited year-over-year sales growth. sales growth in 2021 was partially offset by lower sales of pneumovax 23, the suspension of sales in 2020 of hospital acute care product zerbaxa, and lower sales of virology products isentress/isentress hd.
sales in the u.s. grew 14% in 2021 primarily driven by higher sales of keytruda, sales of molnupiravir, higher sales of bridion, gardasil 9, varivax and proquad, increased alliance revenue from lynparza and lenvima, table of contents as well as higher sales of animal health products. lower sales of pneumovax 23, januvia/janumet and zerbaxa partially offset revenue growth in the u.s. in 2021.
international sales increased 20% in 2021 primarily due to growth in gardasil/gardasil 9, keytruda, sales of molnupiravir, increased alliance revenue from lynparza and lenvima, as well as higher sales of januvia/janumet, bridion, prevymis and animal health products. international sales growth in 2021 was partially offset by lower sales of noxafil, zerbaxa and isentress/isentress hd. international sales represented 54% and 53% of total sales in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
worldwide sales increased 6% in 2020 primarily due to higher sales in the oncology franchise, as well as growth in certain hospital acute care products and animal health. growth in these areas was largely offset by the negative effects of the covid-19 pandemic as discussed above, competitive pressure in the virology franchise and pricing pressure in the diabetes franchise.
see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for details on sales of the company's products. a discussion of performance for select products in the franchises follows.

keytruda is an anti-pd-1 (programmed death receptor-1) therapy that has been approved as monotherapy for the treatment of certain patients with cervical cancer, classical hodgkin lymphoma (chl), cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cscc), esophageal or gastroesophageal junction (gej) carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (hnscc), hcc, nsclc, melanoma, merkel cell carcinoma, microsatellite instability-high (msi-h) or mismatch repair deficient (dmmr) cancer (solid tumors) including msi-h/dmmr colorectal cancer, primary mediastinal large b-cell lymphoma, tmb-h cancer (solid tumors), and urothelial carcinoma including non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. additionally, keytruda is approved as monotherapy for the adjuvant treatment of certain patients with rcc. keytruda is also approved for the treatment of certain patients in combination with chemotherapy for metastatic squamous and nonsquamous nsclc, in combination with chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab for cervical cancer, in combination with chemotherapy for esophageal cancer, in combination with chemotherapy for gastric cancer, in combination with chemotherapy for hnscc, in combination with chemotherapy for triple-negative-breast cancer (tnbc), in combination with axitinib for advanced rcc, and in combination with lenvima for both endometrial carcinoma and rcc. the keytruda clinical development program includes studies across a broad range of cancer types.
global sales of keytruda grew 20% in 2021 driven by higher demand as the company continues to launch keytruda with multiple new indications globally, although the covid-19 pandemic had a dampening effect on growing demand by negatively affecting the number of new patients starting treatment. sales in the u.s. continue to build across the multiple approved indications, in particular for the treatment of advanced nsclc as monotherapy, and in combination with chemotherapy for both nonsquamous and squamous metastatic nsclc, along with continued uptake in the tnbc, rcc, hnscc, msi-h cancer, and esophageal cancer indications. keytruda sales growth in international markets reflects continued uptake predominately for the nsclc, hnscc and rcc indications, particularly in europe. sales growth in 2021 was partially offset by lower pricing in europe, china and japan. global sales of keytruda grew 30% in 2020 driven by higher demand globally, particularly in the u.s. and europe, although the covid-19 pandemic had an unfavorable effect on growing demand. sales growth in 2020 was partially offset by lower pricing in japan and europe.
table of contents keytruda received numerous regulatory approvals in 2021 summarized below.

november 2021        japan's pmda approval in combination with chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil plus cisplatin) for the first-line treatment of patients with radically unresectable, advanced or recurrent esophageal carcinoma in combination with chemotherapy based on the keynote-590 trial.
december 2021        fda approval for the adjuvant treatment of adult and pediatric (12 years and older) patients with stage iib or iic melanoma following complete resection based on the keynote-716 trial; fda expanded the indication for the adjuvant treatment of stage iii melanoma following complete resection to include pediatric patients (12 years and older).
december 2021        japan's mhlw approval of keytruda in combination with lenvima for the treatment of patients with unresectable, advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma that progressed after cancer chemotherapy based on the keynote-775/study 309 trial.
in march 2021, merck announced it was voluntarily withdrawing the u.s. indication for keytruda for the treatment of patients with metastatic small-cell lung cancer with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy and at least one other prior line of therapy. the withdrawal of this indication was done in consultation with the fda and does not affect other indications for keytruda. as announced in january 2020, keynote-604, the confirmatory phase 3 trial for this indication, met one of its dual primary endpoints of progression-free survival but did not reach statistical significance for the other primary endpoint of overall survival.
in 2022, merck initiated the withdrawal of the u.s. accelerated approval indication for keytruda for the treatment of patients with recurrent locally advanced or metastatic gastric or gej adenocarcinoma whose tumors express pd-l1, with disease progression on or after two or more prior lines of therapy. the decision was made in consultation with the fda following the oncologic drugs advisory committee evaluation of this third-line gastric cancer indication for keytruda as a monotherapy because it failed to meet its post-marketing requirement of demonstrating an overall survival benefit in a phase 3 study. the withdrawal of this indication does not affect other indications for keytruda.
the company is a party to certain third-party license agreements pursuant to which the company pays royalties on sales of keytruda. under the terms of the more significant of these agreements, merck pays a royalty of 6.5% on worldwide sales of keytruda through 2023 to one third party; this royalty will decline to 2.5% for 2024 through 2026 and will terminate thereafter. the company pays an additional 2% royalty on worldwide sales of keytruda to another third party, the termination date of which varies by country; this royalty will expire in the u.s. in 2024 and in major european markets in 2025. the royalties are included in cost of sales.
lynparza is an oral poly (adp-ribose) polymerase (parp) inhibitor being developed as part of a collaboration with astrazeneca (see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements). lynparza is approved for the treatment of certain types of advanced ovarian, breast, pancreatic and prostate cancers. alliance revenue related to lynparza grew 36% in 2021 and 63% in 2020 due to continued uptake across the multiple approved indications in the u.s., europe, japan and china. in june 2021, lynparza was granted conditional approval in china as monotherapy for the treatment of certain previously treated adult patients with germline or somatic brca-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer based on the results of the profound trial.
lenvima is an oral receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor being developed as part of a collaboration with eisai (see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements). lenvima is approved for the treatment of certain types of thyroid cancer, hcc, in combination with everolimus for certain patients with rcc, and in combination with keytruda both for the treatment of certain patients with endometrial carcinoma and for the treatment of certain patients with rcc. alliance revenue related to lenvima grew 21% in 2021 and 44% in 2020 primarily due to higher demand in the u.s. and china.
global sales of emend (aprepitant), for the prevention of certain chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, declined 13% in 2021 reflecting lower volumes in europe and china. worldwide sales of emend table of contents decreased 63% in 2020 primarily due to lower demand and pricing in the u.s. due to generic competition for emend for injection following u.s. patent expiry in september 2019. also contributing to the emend sales decline in 2020 was lower demand in europe and japan as a result of generic competition for the oral formulation of emend following loss of market exclusivity in may 2019 and december 2019, respectively.
in june 2021, koselugo (selumetinib) was granted conditional approval in the eu for the treatment of pediatric patients three years of age and older with neurofibromatosis type 1 who have symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas based on positive results from the national cancer institute cancer therapy evaluation program-sponsored sprint stratum 1 trial. koselugo was approved by the fda in april 2020. koselugo is part of the same collaboration with astrazeneca referenced above that includes lynparza.
in august 2021, the fda approved welireg, an oral hif-2α inhibitor, for the treatment of adult patients with vhl disease who require therapy for associated rcc, central nervous system hemangioblastomas, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, not requiring immediate surgery. the approval was based on results from the open-label study 004 trial. welireg was obtained as part of merck's 2019 acquisition of peloton therapeutics, inc. (peloton). see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.

worldwide sales of gardasil/gardasil 9, vaccines to help prevent certain cancers and other diseases caused by certain types of human papillomavirus (hpv), grew 44% in 2021 driven primarily by strong global demand, particularly in china, as well as increased supply. higher pricing in china and the u.s. also contributed to sales growth in 2021. sales growth in 2021 was unfavorably affected by the replenishment in 2020 of doses borrowed from the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) pediatric vaccine stockpile, which favorably affected sales by $120 million in 2020. the timing of public sector purchases in the u.s. also partially offset sales growth in 2021. global sales of gardasil/gardasil 9 grew 5% in 2020 primarily due to higher volumes in china and the replenishment in 2020 of doses borrowed from the cdc pediatric vaccine stockpile in 2019. the replenishment resulted in the recognition of sales of $120 million in 2020, which, when combined with the reduction of sales of $120 million in 2019 due to the borrowing, resulted in a favorable impact to sales of $240 million in 2020 compared with 2019. lower demand in the u.s. and hong kong, sar, prc attributable to the covid-19 pandemic partially offset the increase in sales of gardasil/gardasil 9 in 2020.
the company is a party to certain third-party license agreements pursuant to which the company pays royalties on sales of gardasil/gardasil 9. under the terms of the more significant of these agreements, merck pays a 7% royalty on worldwide sales of gardasil/gardasil 9 to one third party (royalty obligations under this agreement expire in december 2023) and an additional 7% royalty on sales of gardasil/gardasil 9 in the u.s. to another third party (these royalty obligations expire in december 2028). the royalties are included in cost of sales.
global sales of proquad, a pediatric combination vaccine to help protect against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, grew 14% in 2021 due to higher sales in the u.s. reflecting higher demand driven by the ongoing covid-19 pandemic recovery, as well as higher pricing. worldwide sales of proquad declined 10% in 2020 driven primarily by lower demand in the u.s. resulting from fewer measles outbreaks in 2020 compared with 2019, coupled with the unfavorable impact of the covid-19 pandemic, partially offset by higher pricing.
worldwide sales of m-m-r ii, a vaccine to help protect against measles, mumps and rubella, grew 3% in 2021 primarily due to higher sales in the u.s. reflecting the ongoing covid-19 pandemic recovery inclusive of higher public sector mix of business. lower demand in europe partially offset m‐m‐r ii sales growth in 2021. global sales of m-m-r ii declined 31% in 2020 driven primarily by lower demand in the u.s. resulting from fewer table of contents measles outbreaks in 2020 compared with 2019, coupled with the unfavorable impact of the covid-19 pandemic. lower demand in brazil also contributed to the m-m-r ii sales decline in 2020.
global sales of varivax, a vaccine to help prevent chickenpox (varicella), grew 18% in 2021 primarily reflecting the ongoing covid-19 pandemic recovery and higher pricing in the u.s. higher government tenders in brazil also contributed to varivax sales growth in 2021. worldwide sales of varivax declined 15% in 2020 driven primarily by lower demand in the u.s. resulting from the covid-19 pandemic, partially offset by higher pricing. the varivax sales decline in 2020 was also attributable to lower government tenders in brazil.
worldwide sales of pneumovax 23, a vaccine to help prevent pneumococcal disease, declined 18% in 2021 primarily due to lower sales in the u.s. attributable to lower demand reflecting prioritization of covid-19 vaccination, partially offset by higher pricing. global sales of pneumovax 23 grew 17% in 2020 primarily due to higher volumes in europe and the u.s. attributable in part to heightened awareness of pneumococcal vaccination. higher pricing in the u.s. also contributed to pneumovax 23 sales growth in 2020.
in july 2021, the fda approved vaxneuvance for active immunization for the prevention of invasive disease caused by 15 streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes in adults 18 years of age and older. in december 2021, vaxneuvance was approved by the ec. these approvals were based on data from seven clinical studies assessing safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity in adults. in october 2021, the cdc's advisory committee on immunization practices (acip) voted to recommend vaccination either with a sequential regimen of vaxneuvance followed by pneumovax 23, or with a single dose of 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine both for adults 65 years and older and for adults ages 19 to 64 with certain underlying medical conditions. these recommendations subsequently were adopted by the director of the cdc and the u.s. department of health and human services and published in the cdc's morbidity and mortality weekly report. in september 2021, merck announced a settlement and license agreement with pfizer inc. (pfizer), resolving all worldwide patent infringement litigation related to the use of merck's investigational and licensed pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (pcv) products, including vaxneuvance. under the terms of the agreement, merck will make certain regulatory milestone payments to pfizer, as well as royalty payments on the worldwide sales of its pcv products. the company will pay royalties of 7.25% of net sales of all merck pcv products through 2026; and 2.5% of net sales of all merck pcv products from 2027 through 2035.
vaxelis (diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis, inactivated poliovirus, haemophilus b conjugate and hepatitis b vaccine), developed as part of a u.s.-based partnership between merck and sanofi pasteur, is now available in the u.s. for active immunization of children six weeks through four years of age to help prevent diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, hepatitis b, and invasive disease due to haemophilus influenzae type b. in february 2021, the cdc's acip included vaxelis as a combination vaccine option in the cdc's recommended child and adolescent immunization schedule. sales of vaxelis in the u.s. are made through the u.s.-based merck/sanofi pasteur partnership, the results of which are reflected in equity income from affiliates included in other (income) expense, net. supply sales to the partnership are recorded within sales. vaxelis is also approved in the eu where it is marketed directly by merck and sanofi pasteur.

global sales of bridion, for the reversal of two types of neuromuscular blocking agents used during surgery, grew 28% in 2021 due to higher demand globally, particularly in the u.s. and europe, attributable to the covid-19 pandemic recovery, as well as increased usage of neuromuscular blockade reversal agents and bridion's growing share within the class. bridion was also approved by the fda in june 2021 for pediatric patients aged 2 years and older undergoing surgery. worldwide sales of bridion grew 6% in 2020 due to higher demand globally, table of contents particularly in the u.s. however, fewer elective surgeries as a result of the covid-19 pandemic unfavorably affected demand in 2020.
worldwide sales of prevymis, a medicine for prophylaxis (prevention) of cytomegalovirus (cmv) infection and disease in adult cmv-seropositive recipients of an allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, grew 32% in 2021 and increased 70% in 2020 due to continued uptake since launch in several markets, particularly in europe and the u.s.
worldwide sales of noxafil, an antifungal agent for the prevention of certain invasive fungal infections, declined 21% in 2021 primarily due to generic competition in europe, partially offset by higher demand in china. the patent that provided market exclusivity for noxafil in a number of major european markets expired in december 2019. as a result, the company is experiencing lower demand for noxafil in these markets due to generic competition and expects the decline to continue. global sales of noxafil declined 50% in 2020 due to generic competition in the u.s. and in europe. the patent that provided u.s. market exclusivity for certain forms of noxafil representing the majority of u.s. noxafil sales expired in july 2019.
in december 2020, the company temporarily suspended sales of zerbaxa, a combination antibacterial and beta-lactamase inhibitor for the treatment of certain bacterial infections, and subsequently issued a product recall, following the identification of product sterility issues. as a result, the company recorded an intangible asset impairment charge in 2020 related to zerbaxa (see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements). a phased resupply of zerbaxa was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2021, which the company expects to continue during 2022.

sales of simponi, a once-monthly subcutaneous treatment for certain inflammatory diseases (marketed by the company in europe, russia and turkey), declined 2% in 2021 and were nearly flat in 2020. sales of simponi are being unfavorably affected by biosimilar competition for competing products. the company expects this competition will continue to unfavorably affect sales of simponi.
sales of remicade, a treatment for inflammatory diseases (marketed by the company in europe, russia and turkey), declined 9% in 2021 and decreased 20% in 2020 driven by ongoing biosimilar competition in the company's marketing territories in europe. the company lost market exclusivity for remicade in major european markets in 2015 and no longer has market exclusivity in any of its marketing territories. the company is experiencing pricing and volume declines in these markets as a result of biosimilar competition and expects the declines to continue.
the company's marketing rights with respect to these products will revert to janssen pharmaceuticals, inc. on october 1, 2024.

molnupiravir is an investigational oral antiviral covid-19 medicine being developed in a collaboration with ridgeback (see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements). the fda granted an eua for molnupiravir in december 2021; as updated in february 2022, to authorize molnupiravir for the treatment of mild to moderate covid-19 in high-risk adults for whom alternative fda-approved or authorized treatment options are not table of contents accessible or clinically appropriate. also in december 2021, japan's mhlw granted special approval for emergency for molnupiravir to treat infectious disease caused by sars-cov-2. in november 2021, the uk's mhra granted conditional marketing authorization for molnupiravir to treat mild to moderate covid-19 in adults at risk of developing severe illness. merck has entered into advance purchase and supply agreements for molnupiravir in more than 30 markets and merck began shipping molnupiravir in the fourth quarter of 2021 to countries where it is approved or authorized. sales of molnupiravir were $952 million in 2021 primarily consisting of sales in the u.s., the uk and japan.
worldwide sales of isentress/isentress hd, an hiv integrase inhibitor for use in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of hiv-1 infection, declined 10% in 2021 and decreased 12% in 2020 primarily due to competitive pressure particularly in europe and the u.s. the company expects competitive pressure for isentress/isentress hd to continue.
global sales of zepatier, a treatment for adult patients with chronic hepatitis c virus genotype (gt) 1 or gt4 infection, declined 23% in 2021 primarily due to lower demand from competitive pressure in the u.s. and europe. worldwide sales of zepatier declined 55% in 2020 driven by lower demand globally due to competition and declining patient volumes, coupled with the impact of the covid-19 pandemic.

cost of sales cost of sales was $13.6 billion in both 2021 and 2020 and was $12.0 billion in 2019. cost of sales includes the amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions, collaborations, and licensing arrangements, which totaled $1.6 billion in 2021, $1.8 billion in 2020 and $1.7 billion in 2019. costs in 2021 and 2020 also include charges of $225 million and $260 million, respectively, related to the discontinuation of covid-19 development programs (see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). additionally, costs in 2020 and 2019 include intangible asset impairment charges of $1.6 billion and $705 million related to marketed products and other intangibles (see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements). the company may recognize additional impairment charges in the future related to intangible assets that were measured at fair value and capitalized in connection with business combinations and such charges could be material. costs in 2020 also include inventory write-offs of $120 million related to a recall for zerbaxa (see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements). also included in cost of sales are expenses associated with restructuring activities, which amounted to $160 million in 2021, $175 million in 2020 and $251 million in 2019, primarily reflecting accelerated depreciation and asset write-offs related to the planned sale or closure of manufacturing facilities. separation costs associated with manufacturing-related headcount reductions have been incurred and are reflected in restructuring costs as discussed below.
gross margin was 72.0% in 2021 compared with 67.2% in 2020. the gross margin improvement in 2021 reflects lower impairments and amortization of intangible assets (noted above), as well as the favorable effects of product mix and lower inventory write-offs. partially offsetting the gross margin improvement in 2021 were higher manufacturing costs, the impact of molnupiravir (which has a lower gross margin due to profit sharing with ridgeback as discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements), and higher compensation and benefit costs. gross margin was 67.2% in 2020 compared with 69.3% in 2019. the gross margin decline in 2020 reflects the unfavorable effects of higher impairments and amortization of intangible assets, pricing pressure, a charge related to the discontinuation of covid-19 vaccine development programs, and higher inventory write-offs related to the recall of zerbaxa (noted above), partially offset by the favorable effects of product mix and lower restructuring costs.
table of contents selling, general and administrative selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expenses were $9.6 billion in 2021, an increase of 8% compared with 2020. the increase was primarily due to higher administrative costs, including compensation and benefits, higher promotional expenses in support of the company's key growth pillars, and higher acquisition-related costs, including costs related to the acquisition of acceleron. the covid-19 pandemic drove lower spending in 2020 which contributed to the increase in sg&a expenses in 2021. these increases were partially offset by the favorable effects of foreign exchange and a contribution in 2020 to the merck foundation. sg&a expenses were $9.0 billion in 2020, a decline of 5% compared with 2019. the decline was driven primarily by lower administrative, selling and promotional costs, including lower travel and meeting expenses, due in part to the covid-19 pandemic, and the favorable effect of foreign exchange, partially offset by a contribution to the merck foundation.
research and development research and development (r&d) expenses were $12.2 billion in 2021, a decline of 9% compared with 2020 primarily due to lower upfront payments related to acquisitions and collaborations. the decline was partially offset by higher clinical development spending and increased investment in discovery research and early drug development, net of the reimbursement of a portion of molnupiravir development costs through the partnership with ridgeback. higher compensation and benefit costs, higher in-process research and development (ipr&d) impairment charges, as well as costs related to the acquisition of acceleron also partially offset the decline in r&d expenses in 2021. r&d expenses were $13.4 billion in 2020, an increase of 38% compared with 2019. the increase was driven largely by higher upfront payments related to acquisitions and collaborations, higher clinical development spending and increased investment in discovery research and early drug development. higher restructuring costs also contributed to the increase in r&d expenses in 2020. the increase in r&d expenses in 2020 was partially offset by lower ipr&d impairment charges and lower costs resulting from the covid-19 pandemic, net of spending on covid-19-related vaccine and antiviral research programs.
r&d expenses are comprised of the costs directly incurred by merck research laboratories (mrl), the company's research and development division that focuses on human health-related activities, which were $7.1 billion in 2021, $6.5 billion in 2020 and $6.0 billion in 2019. also included in r&d expenses are animal health research costs, licensing costs and costs incurred by other divisions in support of r&d activities, including depreciation, production and general and administrative, which in the aggregate were $3.0 billion in 2021, $2.6 billion in 2020 and $2.6 billion in 2019. additionally, r&d expenses in 2021 include a $1.7 billion charge for the acquisition of pandion. r&d expenses in 2020 include a $2.7 billion charge for the acquisition of velosbio inc., a $462 million charge for the acquisition of oncoimmune and charges of $826 million related to transactions with seagen. r&d expenses in 2019 include a $993 million charge for the acquisition of peloton. see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on these transactions. r&d expenses also include ipr&d impairment charges of $275 million, $90 million and $172 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively (see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements). the company may recognize additional impairment charges in the future related to the cancellation or delay of other pipeline programs that were measured at fair value and capitalized in connection with business combinations and such charges could be material. in addition, r&d expenses in 2021 and 2020 include $28 million and $83 million, respectively, of costs associated with restructuring activities, primarily relating to accelerated depreciation. r&d expenses also include expense or income related to changes in the estimated fair value measurement of liabilities for contingent consideration recorded in connection with business combinations. the company recorded $35 million of expenses in 2021 compared with a net reduction in expenses of $95 million and $39 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to changes in these estimates.
restructuring costs in 2019, merck approved a global restructuring program (restructuring program) as part of a worldwide initiative focused on further optimizing the company's manufacturing and supply network, as well as reducing its global real estate footprint. this program is a continuation of the company's plant rationalization and builds on prior restructuring programs. the actions currently contemplated under the restructuring program are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2023, with the cumulative pretax costs to be incurred by the company to implement the program estimated to be approximately $3.5 billion. the company expects to record charges of table of contents approximately $400 million in 2022 related to the restructuring program. the company anticipates the actions under the restructuring program will result in annual net cost savings of approximately $900 million by the end of 2023.
restructuring costs, primarily representing separation and other related costs associated with these restructuring activities, were $661 million in 2021, $575 million in 2020 and $626 million in 2019. separation costs incurred were associated with actual headcount reductions, as well as estimated expenses under existing severance programs for headcount reductions that were probable and could be reasonably estimated. also included in restructuring costs are asset abandonment, facility shut-down and other related costs, as well as employee-related costs such as curtailment, settlement and termination charges associated with pension and other postretirement benefit plans and share-based compensation plan costs. for segment reporting, restructuring costs are unallocated expenses.
additional costs associated with the company's restructuring activities are included in cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development costs. the company recorded aggregate pretax costs of $868 million in 2021, $880 million in 2020 and $915 million in 2019 related to restructuring program activities (see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements).
other (income) expense, net other (income) expense, net, was $1.3 billion of income in 2021 compared with $890 million of income in 2020 primarily due to higher income from investments in equity securities, net, largely related to higher realized and unrealized gains on certain investments including the disposition in 2021 of the company's ownership interest in preventice solutions inc. (preventice) as a result of the acquisition of preventice by boston scientific, partially offset by higher foreign exchange losses and pension settlement costs. other (income) and expense, net, was $890 million of income in 2020 compared with $129 million of expense in 2019, primarily due to higher income from investments in equity securities, net, largely related to moderna, inc.

pharmaceutical segment profits are comprised of segment sales less standard costs, as well as sg&a expenses directly incurred by the segment. animal health segment profits are comprised of segment sales, less all cost of sales, as well as sg&a and r&d expenses directly incurred by the segment. for internal management reporting presented to the chief operating decision maker, merck does not allocate the remaining cost of sales not included in segment profits as described above, r&d expenses incurred by mrl, or general and administrative expenses, nor the cost of financing these activities. separate divisions maintain responsibility for monitoring and managing these costs, including depreciation related to fixed assets utilized by these divisions and, therefore, they are not included in segment profits. also excluded from the determination of segment profits are costs related to restructuring activities and acquisition and divestiture-related costs, including the amortization of intangible assets and amortization of purchase accounting adjustments, intangible asset impairment charges, and expense or income related to changes in the estimated fair value measurement of liabilities for contingent consideration. additionally, segment profits do not reflect other expenses from corporate and manufacturing cost centers and other miscellaneous income or expense. these unallocated items are reflected in "other" in the above table. also included in "other" are miscellaneous corporate profits (losses), as well as operating profits (losses) related to third-party manufacturing sales. beginning in 2021, the amortization of intangible assets previously included as part of the calculation of table of contents segment profits is now included in unallocated non-segment corporate expenses. prior period pharmaceutical and animal health segment profits have been recast to reflect this change on a comparable basis.
pharmaceutical segment profits grew 19% in 2021 primarily due to higher sales and the favorable effect of foreign exchange, partially offset by higher administrative and promotional costs. pharmaceutical segment profits increased 11% in 2020 driven primarily by higher sales, as well as lower selling and promotional costs. animal health segment profits grew 17% in 2021 reflecting higher sales, partially offset by higher promotional, selling and administrative costs. animal health segment profits increased 4% in 2020 driven primarily by higher sales and lower promotional and selling costs, partially offset by higher r&d costs and the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange.
taxes on income the effective income tax rates from continuing operations were 11.0% in 2021, 22.9% in 2020 and 21.8% in 2019. the full year effective income tax rate reflects a favorable mix of income and expense, as well as higher foreign tax credits from ordinary business operations that the company was able to credit in 2021. the effective income tax rate from continuing operations in 2021 also reflects the beneficial impact of the settlement of a foreign tax matter, as well as a net tax benefit of $207 million related to the settlement of certain federal income tax matters (see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements). the effective income tax rate from continuing operations in 2021 also reflects the unfavorable effect of a charge for the acquisition of pandion for which no tax benefit was recognized. the effective income tax rate in 2020 reflects the unfavorable impact of a charge for the acquisition of velosbio for which no tax benefit was recognized. the effective income tax rate in 2019 reflects the favorable impact of a $106 million net tax benefit related to the settlement of certain federal income tax matters (see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements) and the reversal of tax reserves established in connection with the 2014 divestiture of merck's consumer care (mcc) business due to the lapse in the statute of limitations. in addition, the effective income tax rate in 2019 reflects the unfavorable impact of a charge for the acquisition of peloton for which no tax benefit was recognized and charges of $117 million related to the finalization of treasury regulations for the transition tax associated with the 2017 enactment of u.s. tax legislation known as the tax cuts and jobs act (tcja) (see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).
net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests was $13 million in 2021, $4 million in 2020 and $(84) million in 2019. the loss in 2019 was driven primarily by the portion of goodwill impairment charges related to certain businesses in the healthcare services segment that were attributable to noncontrolling interests.
non-gaap income and non-gaap eps from continuing operations non-gaap income and non-gaap eps are alternative views of the company's performance that merck is providing because management believes this information enhances investors' understanding of the company's results as it permits investors to understand how management assesses performance. non-gaap income and non-gaap eps exclude certain items because of the nature of these items and the impact that they have on the analysis of underlying business performance and trends. the excluded items (which should not be considered non-recurring) consist of acquisition and divestiture-related costs, restructuring costs, income and losses from investments in equity securities and certain other items. these excluded items are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance.
non-gaap income and non-gaap eps are important internal measures for the company. senior management receives a monthly analysis of operating results that includes non-gaap eps. management uses these measures internally for planning and forecasting purposes and to measure the performance of the company along with other metrics. in addition, senior management's annual compensation is derived in part using non-gaap pretax income. since non-gaap income and non-gaap eps are not measures determined in accordance with gaap, they have no standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and, therefore, may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. the information on non-gaap income and non-gaap eps should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, net income and eps prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the u.s. (gaap).

table of contents restructuring costs non-gaap income and non-gaap eps exclude costs related to restructuring actions (see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements). these amounts include employee separation costs and accelerated depreciation associated with facilities to be closed or divested. accelerated depreciation costs represent the difference between the depreciation expense to be recognized over the revised useful life of the asset, based upon the anticipated date the site will be closed or divested or the equipment disposed of, and depreciation expense as determined utilizing the useful life prior to the restructuring actions. restructuring costs also include asset abandonment, facility shut-down and other related costs, as well as employee-related costs such as curtailment, settlement and termination charges associated with pension and other postretirement benefit plans and share-based compensation costs.
certain other items non-gaap income and non-gaap eps exclude certain other items. these items are adjusted for after evaluating them on an individual basis, considering their quantitative and qualitative aspects. typically, these consist of items that are unusual in nature, significant to the results of a particular period or not indicative of future operating results. excluded from non-gaap income and non-gaap eps are charges for the acquisitions of pandion, velosbio, oncoimmune and peloton, as well as charges related to collaborations, including transactions with seagen (see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). also excluded from non-gaap income and non-gaap eps are charges related to the discontinuation of covid-19 development programs (see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements). additionally, excluded from non-gaap income and non-gaap eps are certain tax items, including net tax benefits related to the settlement of certain federal income tax matters, an adjustment to tax benefits recorded in conjunction with the 2015 acquisition of cubist pharmaceuticals, inc., a tax benefit related to the reversal of tax reserves established in connection with the 2014 divestiture of mcc, and a net tax charge related to the finalization of u.s. treasury regulations related to the tcja (see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).
research and development research pipeline the company currently has several candidates under regulatory review in the u.s. and internationally, as well as in late-stage clinical development. a chart reflecting the company's current research pipeline as of february 22, 2022 and related discussion is set forth in item 1. "business - research and development" above.
acquisitions, research collaborations and license agreements merck continues to remain focused on pursuing opportunities that have the potential to drive both near- and long-term growth. certain recent transactions are summarized below; additional details are included in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. merck actively monitors the landscape for growth opportunities that meet the company's strategic criteria.
in march 2021, merck and gilead entered into an agreement to jointly develop and commercialize long-acting treatments in hiv that combine merck's investigational nrtti, islatravir, and gilead's investigational capsid inhibitor, lenacapavir. the collaboration will initially focus on long-acting oral formulations and long-acting injectable formulations of these combination products, with other formulations potentially added to the collaboration as mutually agreed. there was no upfront payment made by either party upon entering into the agreement.
in april 2021, merck acquired pandion, a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel therapeutics designed to address the unmet needs of patients living with autoimmune diseases, for total consideration of $1.9 billion. pandion is advancing a pipeline of precision immune modulators targeting critical immune control nodes.
in november 2021, merck acquired acceleron, a publicly traded biopharmaceutical company, for total consideration of $11.5 billion. acceleron is evaluating the tgf-beta superfamily of proteins that is known to play a central role in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation and repair. acceleron's lead therapeutic candidate, table of contents sotatercept (mk-7962), has a novel mechanism of action with the potential to improve short-term and/or long-term clinical outcomes in patients with pah. sotatercept is in phase 3 trials as an add-on to current standard of care for the treatment of pah. in addition to sotatercept, acceleron's portfolio includes reblozyl (luspatercept), a first-in-class erythroid maturation recombinant fusion protein that is approved in the u.s., europe, canada and australia for the treatment of anemia in certain rare blood disorders and is being evaluated in clinical trials for additional indications for hematology therapies. reblozyl is being developed and commercialized through a global collaboration with bristol myers squibb.
acquired in-process research and development in connection with business combinations, the company has recorded the fair value of in-process research projects which, at the time of acquisition, had not yet reached technological feasibility. at december 31, 2021, the balance of ipr&d was $9.3 billion (see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements).
the ipr&d projects that remain in development are subject to the inherent risks and uncertainties in drug development and it is possible that the company will not be able to successfully develop and complete the ipr&d programs and profitably commercialize the underlying product candidates. the time periods to receive approvals from the fda and other regulatory agencies are subject to uncertainty. significant delays in the approval process, or the company's failure to obtain approval at all, would delay or prevent the company from realizing revenues from these products. additionally, if the ipr&d programs require additional clinical trial data than previously anticipated, or if the programs fail or are abandoned during development, then the company will not realize the future cash flows it has estimated and recorded as ipr&d as of the acquisition date. if such circumstances were to occur, the company's future operating results could be adversely affected and the company may recognize impairment charges, which could be material.
in 2021, 2020, and 2019 the company recorded ipr&d impairment charges within research and development expenses of $275 million, $90 million and $172 million, respectively (see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements).
additional research and development will be required before any of the remaining programs reach technological feasibility. the costs to complete the research projects will depend on whether the projects are brought to their final stages of development and are ultimately submitted to the fda or other regulatory agencies for approval.
capital expenditures capital expenditures were $4.4 billion in 2021, $4.4 billion in 2020 and $3.4 billion in 2019. expenditures in the u.s. were $2.8 billion in 2021, $2.6 billion in 2020 and $1.9 billion in 2019. the company plans to invest approximately $20 billion in capital projects from 2021-2025 including expanding manufacturing capacity for oncology, vaccine and animal health products.
depreciation expense was $1.6 billion in 2021, $1.7 billion in 2020 and $1.6 billion in 2019, of which $1.1 billion in 2021, $1.2 billion in 2020 and $1.2 billion in 2019, related to locations in the u.s. total depreciation expense in 2021, 2020 and 2019 included accelerated depreciation of $91 million, $268 million and $233 million, respectively, associated with restructuring activities (see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements).

table of contents the increase in working capital in 2021 compared with 2020 is primarily related to decreased short-term debt.
cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was $13.1 billion in 2021 compared with $7.6 billion in 2020 and $8.9 billion in 2019. the higher cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations in 2021 reflects stronger operating performance. cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations includes upfront and milestone payments related to collaborations of $435 million in 2021, $2.9 billion in 2020 and $805 million in 2019. cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations continues to be the company's source of funds to finance operating needs, with excess cash serving as the primary source of funds to finance capital expenditures, treasury stock purchases and dividends paid to shareholders.
cash used in investing activities of continuing operations was $16.4 billion in 2021 compared with $9.2 billion in 2020. the higher use of cash in investing activities of continuing operations was primarily due to higher cash used for acquisitions, including for the acquisition of acceleron, and lower proceeds from sales of securities and other investments, partially offset by the 2020 purchase of seagen common stock. cash used in investing activities of continuing operations was $9.2 billion in 2020 compared with $2.5 billion in 2019. the increase was driven primarily by lower proceeds from the sales of securities and other investments, higher use of cash for acquisitions, higher capital expenditures and the purchase of seagen common stock, partially offset by lower purchases of securities and other investments.
cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations was $3.1 billion in 2021 compared with a use of cash in financing activities of continuing operations of $2.8 billion in 2020. the change was primarily driven by the cash distribution received from organon in connection with the spin-off (see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements), higher proceeds from the issuance of debt (see below) and lower purchases of treasury stock, partially offset by a net decrease in short-term borrowings in 2021 compared with a net increase in short-term borrowings in 2020, higher payments on debt (see below) and higher dividends paid to shareholders. cash used in financing activities of continuing operations was $2.8 billion in 2020 compared with $8.9 billion in 2019. the lower use of cash in financing activities of continuing operations was driven primarily by a net increase in short-term borrowings in 2020 compared with a net decrease in short-term borrowing in 2019, as well as lower purchases of treasury stock, partially offset by higher payments on debt (see below), lower proceeds from the issuance of debt (see below), higher dividends paid to shareholders and lower proceeds from the exercise of stock options.
in december 2021, the company issued $8.0 billion principal amount of senior unsecured notes consisting of $1.5 billion of 1.70% notes due 2027, $1.0 billion of 1.90% notes due 2028, $2.0 billion of 2.15% notes due 2031, $2.0 billion of 2.75% notes due 2051 and $1.5 billion of 2.90% notes due 2061. merck used the net proceeds from the offering of the 2027 notes, the 2031 notes, the 2051 notes and the 2061 notes for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings (including commercial paper borrowings in connection with merck's acquisition of acceleron), and other indebtedness. merck allocated an amount equal to the net proceeds of the offering of the notes due in 2028 to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, projects and partnerships in the company's priority esg areas.

financial instruments market risk disclosures the company manages the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on its earnings, cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities through operational means and through the use of various financial instruments, including derivative instruments.
a significant portion of the company's revenues and earnings in foreign affiliates is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. the objectives of and accounting related to the company's foreign currency risk management program, as well as its interest rate risk management activities are discussed below.
foreign currency risk management the company has established revenue hedging, balance sheet risk management, and net investment hedging programs to protect against volatility of future foreign currency cash flows and changes in fair value caused by changes in foreign exchange rates.
the objective of the revenue hedging program is to reduce the variability caused by changes in foreign exchange rates that would affect the u.s. dollar value of future cash flows derived from foreign currency denominated sales, primarily the euro, japanese yen and chinese renminbi. to achieve this objective, the company will hedge a portion of its forecasted foreign currency denominated third-party and intercompany distributor entity sales (forecasted sales) that are expected to occur over its planning cycle, typically no more than two years into the future. the company will layer in hedges over time, increasing the portion of forecasted sales hedged as it gets closer to the expected date of the forecasted sales. the portion of forecasted sales hedged is based on assessments of cost-benefit profiles that consider natural offsetting exposures, revenue and exchange rate volatilities and correlations, and the cost of hedging instruments. the company manages its anticipated transaction exposure principally with purchased local currency put options, forward contracts, and purchased collar options.
the fair values of these derivative contracts are recorded as either assets (gain positions) or liabilities (loss positions) in the consolidated balance sheet. changes in the fair value of derivative contracts are recorded each period in either current earnings or other comprehensive income (loss) (oci), depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge transaction. for derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges, the unrealized gains or losses on these contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss (aocl) and reclassified into sales when the hedged anticipated revenue is recognized. for those derivatives which are not designated as cash flow hedges, but serve as economic hedges of forecasted sales, unrealized gains or losses are recorded in sales each period. the cash flows from both designated and non-designated contracts are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. the company does not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
because merck principally sells foreign currency in its revenue hedging program, a uniform weakening of the u.s. dollar would yield the largest overall potential loss in the market value of these hedge instruments. the market value of merck's hedges would have declined by an estimated $648 million and $593 million at december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, from a uniform 10% weakening of the u.s. dollar. the market value was determined using a foreign exchange option pricing model and holding all factors except exchange rates constant. although not predictive in nature, the company believes that a 10% threshold reflects reasonably possible near-term changes in merck's major foreign currency exposures relative to the u.s. dollar.
the company manages operating activities and net asset positions at each local subsidiary in order to mitigate the effects of exchange on monetary assets and liabilities. the company also uses a balance sheet risk management program to mitigate the exposure of net monetary assets that are denominated in a currency other than a subsidiary's functional currency from the effects of volatility in foreign exchange. in these instances, merck principally utilizes forward exchange contracts to offset the effects of exchange on exposures denominated in developed country currencies, primarily the euro, japanese yen, british pound, canadian dollar and swiss franc. for exposures in developing country currencies, including the chinese renminbi, the company will enter into forward contracts to offset the effects of exchange on exposures when it is deemed economical to do so based on a cost-benefit analysis that considers the magnitude of the exposure, the volatility of the exchange rate and the cost of the table of contents hedging instrument. the cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of a given subsidiary are remeasured at spot rates in effect on the balance sheet date with the effects of changes in spot rates reported in other (income) expense, net. the forward contracts are not designated as hedges and are marked to market through other (income) expense, net. accordingly, fair value changes in the forward contracts help mitigate the changes in the value of the remeasured assets and liabilities attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, except to the extent of the spot-forward differences. these differences are not significant due to the short-term nature of the contracts, which typically have average maturities at inception of less than one year.
a sensitivity analysis to changes in the value of the u.s. dollar on foreign currency denominated derivatives, investments and monetary assets and liabilities indicated that if the u.s. dollar uniformly weakened by 10% against all currency exposures of the company at december 31, 2021 and 2020, income from continuing operations before taxes would have declined by approximately $125 million and $99 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. because the company was in a net short (payable) position relative to its major foreign currencies after consideration of forward contracts, a uniform weakening of the u.s. dollar will yield the largest overall potential net loss in earnings due to exchange. this measurement assumes that a change in one foreign currency relative to the u.s. dollar would not affect other foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar. although not predictive in nature, the company believes that a 10% threshold reflects reasonably possible near-term changes in merck's major foreign currency exposures relative to the u.s. dollar. the cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
the company also uses forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion of its net investment in foreign operations against movements in exchange rates. the forward contracts are designated as hedges of the net investment in a foreign operation. the unrealized gains or losses on these contracts are recorded in foreign currency translation adjustment within oci, and remain in aocl until either the sale or complete or substantially complete liquidation of the subsidiary. the company excludes certain portions of the change in fair value of its derivative instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness (excluded components). changes in fair value of the excluded components are recognized in oci. the company recognizes in earnings the initial value of the excluded components on a straight-line basis over the life of the derivative instrument, rather than using the mark-to-market approach. the cash flows from these contracts are reported as investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
foreign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency debt. the company's senior unsecured euro-denominated notes have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of the net investment in a foreign operation. accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments are included in foreign currency translation adjustment within oci.
interest rate risk management the company may use interest rate swap contracts on certain investing and borrowing transactions to manage its net exposure to interest rate changes and to reduce its overall cost of borrowing. the company does not use leveraged swaps and, in general, does not leverage any of its investment activities that would put principal capital at risk.
at december 31, 2021, the company was a party to nine pay-floating, receive-fixed interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges of fixed-rate notes in which the notional amounts match the amount of the hedged fixed-rate notes as detailed in the table below.
debt instrument                      par value of debt                 number of interest rate swaps held                total swap notional amount table of contents the interest rate swap contracts are designated hedges of the fair value changes in the notes attributable to changes in the benchmark london interbank offered rate (libor) swap rate. the fair value changes in the notes attributable to changes in the libor swap rate are recorded in interest expense along with the offsetting fair value changes in the swap contracts. see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the pending discontinuation of libor as part of reference rate reform. the cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
the company's investment portfolio includes cash equivalents and short-term investments, the market values of which are not significantly affected by changes in interest rates. the market value of the company's medium- to long-term fixed-rate investments is modestly affected by changes in u.s. interest rates. changes in medium- to long-term u.s. interest rates have a more significant impact on the market value of the company's fixed-rate borrowings, which generally have longer maturities. a sensitivity analysis to measure potential changes in the market value of merck's investments and debt from a change in interest rates indicated that a one percentage point increase in interest rates at december 31, 2021 and 2020 would have positively affected the net aggregate market value of these instruments by $3.2 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. a one percentage point decrease at december 31, 2021 and 2020 would have negatively affected the net aggregate market value by $3.9 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively. the fair value of merck's debt was determined using pricing models reflecting one percentage point shifts in the appropriate yield curves. the fair values of merck's investments were determined using a combination of pricing and duration models.
critical accounting estimates the company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap and, accordingly, include certain amounts that are based on management's best estimates and judgments. estimates are used when accounting for amounts recorded in connection with acquisitions, including initial fair value determinations of assets and liabilities (primarily ipr&d, other intangible assets and contingent consideration), as well as subsequent fair value measurements. additionally, estimates are used in determining such items as provisions for sales discounts and returns, depreciable and amortizable lives, recoverability of inventories, including those produced in preparation for product launches, amounts recorded for contingencies, environmental liabilities, accruals for contingent sales-based milestone payments and other reserves, pension and other postretirement benefit plan assumptions, share-based compensation assumptions, restructuring costs, impairments of long-lived assets (including intangible assets and goodwill) and investments, and taxes on income. because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. application of the following accounting policies result in accounting estimates having the potential for the most significant impact on the financial statements.
acquisitions and dispositions to determine whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses, the company makes certain judgments, which include assessment of the inputs, processes, and outputs associated with the acquired set of activities. if the company determines that substantially all of the fair value of gross assets included in a transaction is concentrated in a single asset (or a group of similar assets), the assets would not represent a business. to be considered a business, the assets in a transaction need to include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs.
in a business combination, the acquisition method of accounting requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded as of the date of the acquisition at their respective fair values with limited exceptions. the fair values of intangible assets are determined utilizing information available near the acquisition date based on expectations and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management. given the considerable judgment involved in determining fair values, the company typically obtains assistance from third-party valuation specialists for significant items. assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies are generally recognized at fair value. if fair value cannot be determined, the asset or liability is recognized if probable and reasonably estimable; if these criteria are not met, no asset or liability is recognized. fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. accordingly, the company may be required to value assets at fair value measures that do not reflect the company's intended use of those assets. any excess of the purchase price (consideration transferred)
table of contents over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. transaction costs and costs to restructure the acquired company are expensed as incurred. the operating results of the acquired business are reflected in the company's consolidated financial statements after the date of the acquisition.
the judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, as well as asset lives, can materially affect the company's results of operations.
the fair values of identifiable intangible assets related to currently marketed products and product rights are primarily determined by using an income approach through which fair value is estimated based on each asset's discounted projected net cash flows. the company's estimates of market participant net cash flows consider historical and projected pricing, margins and expense levels; the performance of competing products where applicable; relevant industry and therapeutic area growth drivers and factors; current and expected trends in technology and product life cycles; the time and investment that will be required to develop products and technologies; the ability to obtain marketing and regulatory approvals; the ability to manufacture and commercialize the products; the extent and timing of potential new product introductions by the company's competitors; and the life of each asset's underlying patent and any related patent term extension, if any. the net cash flows are then probability-adjusted where appropriate to consider the uncertainties associated with the underlying assumptions, as well as the risk profile of the net cash flows utilized in the valuation. the probability-adjusted future net cash flows of each product are then discounted to present value utilizing an appropriate discount rate.
the fair values of identifiable intangible assets related to ipr&d are also determined using an income approach, through which fair value is estimated based on each asset's probability-adjusted future net cash flows, which reflect the different stages of development of each product and the associated probability of successful completion. the net cash flows are then discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. amounts allocated to acquired ipr&d are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets, subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the projects. upon successful completion of each ipr&d project, merck will make a determination as to the then-useful life of the intangible asset, generally determined by the period in which the substantial majority of the cash flows are expected to be generated, and begin amortization.
certain of the company's business combinations involve the potential for future payment of consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of performance milestones, including product development milestones and royalty payments on future product sales. the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is determined at the acquisition date using unobservable inputs. these inputs include the estimated amount and timing of projected cash flows, the probability of success (achievement of the contingent event) and the risk-adjusted discount rate used to present value the probability-weighted cash flows. subsequent to the acquisition date, at each reporting period until the contingency is resolved, the contingent consideration liability is remeasured at current fair value with changes (either expense or income) recorded in earnings. changes in any of the inputs may result in a significantly different fair value adjustment.
if the company determines the transaction will not be accounted for as an acquisition of a business, the transaction will be accounted for as an asset acquisition rather than a business combination and, therefore, no goodwill will be recorded. in an asset acquisition, acquired ipr&d with no alternative future use is charged to expense and contingent consideration is not recognized at the acquisition date. in these instances, product development milestones are recognized upon achievement and sales-based milestones are recognized when the milestone is deemed probable by the company of being achieved.
revenue recognition recognition of revenue requires evidence of a contract, probable collection of sales proceeds and completion of substantially all performance obligations. merck acts as the principal in substantially all of its customer arrangements and therefore records revenue on a gross basis. the majority of the company's contracts related to the pharmaceutical and animal health segments have a single performance obligation - the promise to transfer goods. shipping is considered immaterial in the context of the overall customer arrangement and damages or loss of goods in transit are rare. therefore, shipping is not deemed a separately recognized performance obligation.
the vast majority of revenues from sales of products are recognized at a point in time when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which the company has determined is when title and risks and rewards of table of contents ownership transfer to the customer and the company is entitled to payment. for certain services in the animal health segment, revenue is recognized over time, generally ratably over the contract term as services are provided. these service revenues are not material.
the nature of the company's business gives rise to several types of variable consideration including discounts and returns, which are estimated at the time of sale generally using the expected value method, although the most likely amount method is used for prompt pay discounts.
in the u.s., sales discounts are issued to customers at the point-of-sale, through an intermediary wholesaler (known as chargebacks), or in the form of rebates. additionally, sales are generally made with a limited right of return under certain conditions. revenues are recorded net of provisions for sales discounts and returns, which are established at the time of sale. in addition, if collection of accounts receivable is expected to be in excess of one year, sales are recorded net of time value of money discounts, which have not been material.
the u.s. provision for aggregate customer discounts covers chargebacks and rebates. chargebacks are discounts that occur when a contracted customer purchases through an intermediary wholesaler. the contracted customer generally purchases product from the wholesaler at its contracted price plus a mark-up. the wholesaler, in turn, charges the company back for the difference between the price initially paid by the wholesaler and the contract price paid to the wholesaler by the customer. the provision for chargebacks is based on expected sell-through levels by the company's wholesale customers to contracted customers, as well as estimated wholesaler inventory levels. rebates are amounts owed based upon definitive contractual agreements or legal requirements with private sector and public sector (medicaid and medicare part d) benefit providers after the final dispensing of the product to a benefit plan participant. the provision for rebates is based on expected patient usage, as well as inventory levels in the distribution channel to determine the contractual obligation to the benefit providers. the company uses historical customer segment utilization mix, sales forecasts, changes to product mix and price, inventory levels in the distribution channel, government pricing calculations and prior payment history in order to estimate the expected provision. amounts accrued for aggregate customer discounts are evaluated on a quarterly basis through comparison of information provided by the wholesalers, health maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, federal and state agencies, and other customers to the amounts accrued.
the company continually monitors its provision for aggregate customer discounts. there were no material adjustments to estimates associated with the aggregate customer discount provision in 2021, 2020 or 2019.
summarized information about changes in the aggregate customer discount accrual related to u.s. sales is as follows:
adjustments to prior years             (110)                       (24)
outside of the u.s., variable consideration in the form of discounts and rebates are a combination of commercially-driven discounts in highly competitive product classes, discounts required to gain or maintain reimbursement, or legislatively mandated rebates. in certain european countries, legislatively mandated rebates are calculated based on an estimate of the government's total unbudgeted spending and the company's specific payback obligation. rebates may also be required based on specific product sales thresholds. the company applies an estimated factor against its actual invoiced sales to represent the expected level of future discount or rebate obligations associated with the sale.
the company maintains a returns policy that allows its u.s. pharmaceutical customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date (generally, three to six months before and 12
table of contents months after product expiration). the estimate of the provision for returns is based upon historical experience with actual returns. additionally, the company considers factors such as levels of inventory in the distribution channel, product dating and expiration period, whether products have been discontinued, entrance in the market of generic or other competition, changes in formularies or launch of over-the-counter products, among others. the product returns provision for u.s. pharmaceutical sales as a percentage of u.s. net pharmaceutical sales was 0.9% in 2021, 0.5% in 2020 and 1.0% in 2019. outside of the u.s., returns are only allowed in certain countries on a limited basis.
merck's payment terms for u.s. pharmaceutical customers are typically 36 days from receipt of invoice and for u.s. animal health customers are typically 30 days from receipt of invoice; however, certain products, including keytruda, have longer payment terms, some of which are up to 90 days. outside of the u.s., payment terms are typically 30 days to 90 days, although certain markets have longer payment terms.
through its distribution programs with u.s. wholesalers, the company encourages wholesalers to align purchases with underlying demand and maintain inventories below specified levels. the terms of the programs allow the wholesalers to earn fees upon providing visibility into their inventory levels, as well as by achieving certain performance parameters such as inventory management, customer service levels, reducing shortage claims and reducing product returns. information provided through the wholesaler distribution programs includes items such as sales trends, inventory on-hand, on-order quantity and product returns.
wholesalers generally provide only the above-mentioned data to the company, as there is no regulatory requirement to report lot level information to manufacturers, which is the level of information needed to determine the remaining shelf life and original sale date of inventory. given current wholesaler inventory levels, which are generally less than a month, the company believes that collection of order lot information across all wholesale customers would have limited use in estimating sales discounts and returns.
inventories produced in preparation for product launches the company capitalizes inventories produced in preparation for product launches sufficient to support estimated initial market demand. typically, capitalization of such inventory does not begin until the related product candidates are in phase 3 clinical trials and are considered to have a high probability of regulatory approval. the company monitors the status of each respective product within the regulatory approval process; however, the company generally does not disclose specific timing for regulatory approval. if the company is aware of any specific risks or contingencies other than the normal regulatory approval process or if there are any specific issues identified during the research process relating to safety, efficacy, manufacturing, marketing or labeling, the related inventory would generally not be capitalized. expiry dates of the inventory are affected by the stage of completion. the company manages the levels of inventory at each stage to optimize the shelf life of the inventory in relation to anticipated market demand in order to avoid product expiry issues. for inventories that are capitalized, anticipated future sales and shelf lives support the realization of the inventory value as the inventory shelf life is sufficient to meet initial product launch requirements. inventories produced in preparation for product launches capitalized at december 31, 2021 and 2020 were $256 million and $279 million, respectively.
contingencies and environmental liabilities the company is involved in various claims and legal proceedings of a nature considered normal to its business, including product liability, intellectual property and commercial litigation, as well as certain additional matters including governmental and environmental matters (see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements). the company records accruals for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. these accruals are adjusted periodically as assessments change or additional information becomes available. for product liability claims, a portion of the overall accrual is actuarially determined and considers such factors as past experience, number of claims reported and estimates of claims incurred but not yet reported. individually significant contingent losses are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable.
legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable. some of the significant factors considered in the review of these legal defense reserves are as follows: the actual costs incurred by the company; the development of the company's legal defense strategy and structure in light of the scope of its litigation; the number of cases being brought against the company; the costs and outcomes of completed trials and the most current information regarding anticipated timing, progression, and related costs of pre-trial activities and trials in the associated litigation. the amount of legal defense table of contents reserves as of december 31, 2021 and 2020 of approximately $230 million and $235 million, respectively, represents the company's best estimate of the minimum amount of defense costs to be incurred in connection with its outstanding litigation; however, events such as additional trials and other events that could arise in the course of its litigation could affect the ultimate amount of legal defense costs to be incurred by the company. the company will continue to monitor its legal defense costs and review the adequacy of the associated reserves and may determine to increase the reserves at any time in the future if, based upon the factors set forth, it believes it would be appropriate to do so.
the company and its subsidiaries are parties to a number of proceedings brought under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act, commonly known as superfund, and other federal and state equivalents. when a legitimate claim for contribution is asserted, a liability is initially accrued based upon the estimated transaction costs to manage the site. accruals are adjusted as site investigations, feasibility studies and related cost assessments of remedial techniques are completed, and as the extent to which other potentially responsible parties who may be jointly and severally liable can be expected to contribute is determined.
the company is also remediating environmental contamination resulting from past industrial activity at certain of its sites and takes an active role in identifying and accruing for these costs. in the past, merck performed a worldwide survey to assess all sites for potential contamination resulting from past industrial activities. where assessment indicated that physical investigation was warranted, such investigation was performed, providing a better evaluation of the need for remedial action. where such need was identified, remedial action was then initiated. as definitive information became available during the course of investigations and/or remedial efforts at each site, estimates were refined and accruals were established or adjusted accordingly. these estimates and related accruals continue to be refined annually.
the company believes that there are no compliance issues associated with applicable environmental laws and regulations that would have a material adverse effect on the company. expenditures for remediation and environmental liabilities were $12 million in 2021 and are estimated to be $24 million in the aggregate for the years 2022 through 2026. in management's opinion, the liabilities for all environmental matters that are probable and reasonably estimable have been accrued and totaled $40 million and $43 million at december 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. these liabilities are undiscounted, do not consider potential recoveries from other parties and will be paid out over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites, which are expected to occur primarily over the next 15 years. although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these matters, or the ultimate costs of remediation, management does not believe that any reasonably possible expenditures that may be incurred in excess of the liabilities accrued should exceed approximately $40 million in the aggregate. management also does not believe that these expenditures should result in a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity for any year.
share-based compensation the company expenses all share-based payment awards to employees, including grants of stock options, over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value of the awards. the company determines the fair value of certain share-based awards using the black-scholes option-pricing model which uses both historical and current market data to estimate the fair value. this method incorporates various assumptions such as the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, expected dividend yield and expected life of the options. total pretax share-based compensation expense from continuing operations was $479 million in 2021, $441 million in 2020 and $388 million in 2019. at december 31, 2021, there was $699 million of total pretax unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested stock option, restricted stock unit and performance share unit awards which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years. for segment reporting, share-based compensation costs are unallocated expenses.
pensions and other postretirement benefit plans net periodic benefit cost for pension plans totaled $748 million in 2021, $450 million in 2020 and $134 million in 2019. net periodic benefit credit for other postretirement benefit plans was $83 million in 2021, $59 million in 2020 and $49 million in 2019. pension and other postretirement benefit plan information for financial reporting purposes is calculated using actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan benefit obligations table of contents and an expected rate of return on plan assets. the changes in net periodic benefit cost year over year for pension plans are attributable to settlement charges incurred by certain plans, as well as changes in the discount rate.
the company reassesses its benefit plan assumptions on a regular basis. for both the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, the discount rate is evaluated on measurement dates and modified to reflect the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality fixed-income debt instruments that would provide the future cash flows needed to pay the benefits included in the benefit obligation as they come due. the discount rates for the company's u.s. pension and other postretirement benefit plans ranged from 2.60% to 3.10% at december 31, 2021, compared with a range of 2.10% to 2.80% at december 31, 2020.
the expected rate of return for both the pension and other postretirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. in developing the expected rate of return, the company considers long-term compound annualized returns of historical market data, current market conditions and actual returns on the company's plan assets. using this reference information, the company develops forward-looking return expectations for each asset category and a weighted-average expected long-term rate of return for a target portfolio allocated across these investment categories. the expected portfolio performance reflects the contribution of active management as appropriate. for 2022, the expected rate of return for the company's u.s. pension and other postretirement benefit plans will be 6.70%, compared to a range of 6.50% to 6.70% in 2021.
the company has established investment guidelines for its u.s. pension and other postretirement plans to create an asset allocation that is expected to deliver a rate of return sufficient to meet the long-term obligation of each plan, given an acceptable level of risk. the target investment portfolio of the company's u.s. pension and other postretirement benefit plans is allocated 30% to 45% in u.s. equities, 15% to 30% in international equities, 35% to 45% in fixed-income investments, and up to 5% in cash and other investments. the portfolio's equity weighting is consistent with the long-term nature of the plans' benefit obligations. the expected annual standard deviation of returns of the target portfolio, which approximates 11%, reflects both the equity allocation and the diversification benefits among the asset classes in which the portfolio invests. for international pension plans, the targeted investment portfolio varies based on the duration of pension liabilities and local government rules and regulations. although a significant percentage of plan assets are invested in u.s. equities, concentration risk is mitigated through the use of strategies that are diversified within management guidelines.
actuarial assumptions are based upon management's best estimates and judgment. a reasonably possible change of plus (minus) 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have had an estimated $85 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on the company's net periodic benefit cost in 2021. a reasonably possible change of plus (minus) 25 basis points in the expected rate of return assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have had an estimated $58 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on merck's net periodic benefit cost in 2021. required funding obligations for 2022 relating to the company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans are not expected to be material. the preceding hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected rate of return assumptions would not impact the company's funding requirements.
net loss amounts, which primarily reflect differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recorded as a component of aocl. expected returns for pension plans are based on a calculated market-related value of assets. net loss amounts in aocl in excess of certain thresholds are amortized into net periodic benefit cost over the average remaining service life of employees.
restructuring costs restructuring costs have been recorded in connection with restructuring programs designed to streamline the company's cost structure. as a result, the company has made estimates and judgments regarding its future plans, including future termination benefits and other exit costs to be incurred when the restructuring actions take place. when accruing termination costs, the company will recognize the amount within a range of costs that is the best estimate within the range. when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the company recognizes the minimum amount within the range. in connection with these actions, management also assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business. in certain instances, asset lives have been shortened based on changes in the expected useful lives of the affected assets. severance and other related costs are reflected within restructuring costs. asset-related charges are reflected within cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses depending upon the nature of the asset.
table of contents impairments of long-lived assets the company assesses changes in economic, regulatory and legal conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the company's property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets.
the company periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying values of its long-lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. if such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows of these assets, or appropriate asset groupings, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. if the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset's fair value and its carrying value. if quoted market prices are not available, the company will estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows approach.
goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired. goodwill is assigned to reporting units and evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist, by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macroeconomic conditions, conditions specific to the industry and market, cost factors which could have a significant effect on earnings or cash flows, the overall financial performance of the reporting unit, and whether there have been sustained declines in the company's share price. if the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative fair value test is performed. if the carrying value of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value, a goodwill impairment charge will be recorded for the difference (up to the carrying value of goodwill).
other acquired intangible assets (excluding ipr&d) are initially recorded at fair value, assigned an estimated useful life, and amortized primarily on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. when events or circumstances warrant a review, the company will assess recoverability from future operations using pretax undiscounted cash flows derived from the lowest appropriate asset groupings. impairments are recognized in operating results to the extent that the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, which is determined based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows.
ipr&d that the company acquires in conjunction with the acquisition of a business represents the fair value assigned to incomplete research projects which, at the time of acquisition, have not reached technological feasibility. the amounts are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets, subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the projects. the company evaluates ipr&d for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist, by performing a quantitative test that compares the fair value of the ipr&d intangible asset with its carrying value. for impairment testing purposes, the company may combine separately recorded ipr&d intangible assets into one unit of account based on the relevant facts and circumstances. generally, the company will combine ipr&d intangible assets for testing purposes if they operate as a single asset and are essentially inseparable. if the fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized in operating results.
the judgments made in evaluating impairment of long-lived intangibles can materially affect the company's results of operations.
taxes on income the company's effective tax rate is based on pretax income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates. an estimated effective tax rate for a year is applied to the company's quarterly operating results. in the event that there is a significant unusual or one-time item recognized, or expected to be recognized, in the company's quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as the unusual or one-time item. the company considers the resolution of prior year tax matters to be such items. significant judgment is required in determining the company's tax provision and in evaluating its tax positions. the recognition and measurement of a tax position is based on management's best judgment given the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. the company evaluates tax positions to determine whether the benefits of tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax table of contents position. for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the company recognizes the amount of the benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements. for tax positions that are not more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the company does not recognize any portion of the benefit in the financial statements. if the more likely than not threshold is not met in the period for which a tax position is taken, the company may subsequently recognize the benefit of that tax position if the tax matter is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires, or if the more likely than not threshold is met in a subsequent period (see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).
tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which the company has already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. the company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred or expense for which the company has already taken a deduction on the tax return, but has not yet recognized as expense in the financial statements.

cautionary factors that may affect future results this report and other written reports and oral statements made from time to time by the company may contain so-called "forward-looking statements," all of which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause results to differ materially from those set forth in the statements. one can identify these forward-looking statements by their use of words such as "anticipates," "expects," "plans," "will," "estimates," "forecasts," "projects" and other words of similar meaning, or negative variations of any of the foregoing. one can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. these statements are likely to address the company's growth strategy, financial results, product approvals, product potential, development programs, environmental or other sustainability initiatives, and include statements related to the expected impact of the covid-19 pandemic. one must carefully consider any such statement and should understand that many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the company's forward-looking statements. these factors include inaccurate assumptions and a broad variety of other risks and uncertainties, including some that are known and some that are not. no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual future results may vary materially.
the company does not assume the obligation to update any forward-looking statement. one should carefully evaluate such statements in light of factors, including risk factors, described in the company's filings with the securities and exchange commission, especially on this form 10-k and forms 10-q and 8-k. in item 1a. "risk factors" of this annual report on form 10-k the company discusses in more detail various important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historic results. the company notes these factors for investors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. one should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. consequently, the reader should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties.

risks related to our business and industry
•   consumption of tax-paid cigarettes continues to decline in many of our markets.
this decline is due to multiple factors, including increased taxes and pricing, governmental actions, the diminishing social acceptance of smoking, continuing economic and geopolitical uncertainty, and the continuing prevalence of illicit products. these factors and their potential consequences are discussed more fully below and in item 7, business environment.
•   cigarettes are subject to substantial taxes. significant increases in cigarette-related taxes have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted in numerous jurisdictions. these tax increases may disproportionately affect our profitability and make us less competitive versus certain of our competitors.
tax regimes, including excise taxes, sales taxes and import duties, can disproportionately affect the retail price of cigarettes versus other tobacco products, or disproportionately affect the relative retail price of our cigarette brands versus cigarette brands manufactured by certain of our competitors. because our portfolio is weighted toward the premium-price cigarette category, tax regimes based on sales price can place us at a competitive disadvantage in certain markets. as a result, our volume and profitability may be adversely affected in these markets.
increases in cigarette taxes are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our sales of cigarettes, due to resulting lower consumption levels, a shift in sales from manufactured cigarettes to other tobacco products and from the premium-price to the mid-price or low-price cigarette categories, where we may be under-represented, from local sales to legal cross-border purchases of lower price products, or to illicit products such as contraband, counterfeit and "illicit whites."
•   our business faces significant governmental action aimed at increasing regulatory requirements with the goal of reducing or preventing the use of tobacco products.
governmental actions, combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking, have resulted in reduced industry volume in many of our markets, and we expect that such factors will continue to reduce consumption levels and will increase down-trading and the risk of counterfeiting, contraband, "illicit whites" and legal cross-border purchases. significant regulatory developments will take place over the next few years in most of our markets, driven principally by the world health organization's framework convention on tobacco control ("fctc"). the fctc is the first international public health treaty on tobacco, and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation. the fctc has led to increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and public health organizations to promote increasingly restrictive regulatory measures on the marketing and sale of tobacco products to adult smokers. regulatory initiatives that have been proposed, introduced or enacted include:
•   restrictions on or licensing of outlets permitted to sell cigarettes;
•   the levying of substantial and increasing tax and duty charges;
•   restrictions or bans on advertising, marketing and sponsorship;
•   the display of larger health warnings, graphic health warnings and other labeling requirements;
•   restrictions on packaging design, including the use of colors, and plain packaging;
•   restrictions or bans on the display of tobacco product packaging at the point of sale and restrictions or bans on cigarette vending machines;
•   requirements regarding testing, disclosure and performance standards for tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide and other smoke constituents;
•   disclosure, restrictions, or bans of tobacco product ingredients;
•   restrictions on the sale of novel tobacco or nicotine-containing products;
•   elimination of duty free sales and duty free allowances for travelers; and our operating income could be significantly affected by regulatory initiatives resulting in a significant decrease in demand for our brands, in particular requirements that lead to a commoditization of tobacco products, as well as any significant increase in the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements.
•   litigation related to tobacco use and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke could substantially reduce our profitability and could severely impair our liquidity.
there is litigation related to tobacco products pending in certain jurisdictions. damages claimed in some tobacco-related litigation are significant and, in certain cases in brazil, canada and nigeria, range into the billions of u.s. dollars. we anticipate that new cases will continue to be filed. the fctc encourages litigation against tobacco product manufacturers. it is possible that our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation. see item 3. legal proceedings and item 8, financial statements and supplementary data, note 19. contingencies for a discussion of pending litigation.
•   we face intense competition, and our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.
we compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, innovation, packaging, service, marketing, advertising and price. we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business. the competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions, erosion of consumer confidence, competitors' introduction of lower-price products or innovative products, higher tobacco product taxes, higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories, and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products. competitors include three large international tobacco companies and several regional and local tobacco companies and, in some instances, state-owned tobacco enterprises, principally in algeria, the prc, egypt, taiwan, thailand and vietnam. industry consolidation and privatizations of state-owned enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures. some competitors have different profit and volume objectives, and some international competitors are susceptible to changes in different currency exchange rates.
•   because we have operations in numerous countries, our results may be influenced by economic, regulatory and political developments, natural disasters or conflicts.
some of the countries in which we operate face the threat of civil unrest and can be subject to regime changes. in others, nationalization, terrorism, conflict and the threat of war may have a significant impact on the business environment. economic, political, regulatory or other developments or natural disasters could disrupt our supply chain, manufacturing capabilities or distribution capabilities. in addition, such developments could lead to loss of property or equipment that are critical to our business in certain markets and difficulty in staffing and managing our operations, which could reduce our volumes, revenues and net earnings.
in certain markets, we are dependent on governmental approvals of various actions such as price changes, and failure to obtain such approvals could impair growth in our profitability.
in addition, despite our high ethical standards and rigorous control and compliance procedures aimed at preventing and detecting unlawful conduct, given the breadth and scope of our international operations, we may not be able to detect all potential improper or unlawful conduct by our employees and international partners.
•   we may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences or to respond to consumer behavior influenced by economic downturns.
our tobacco business is subject to changes in consumer preferences, which may be influenced by local economic conditions. to be successful, we must:
•   promote brand equity successfully;
•   develop new products and markets and broaden brand portfolios;
•   improve productivity;
•   ensure adequate production capacity to meet demand for our products; and in periods of economic uncertainty, consumers may tend to purchase lower-price brands, and the volume of our premium-price and mid-price brands and our profitability could suffer accordingly. such down-trading trends may be reinforced by regulation that limits branding, communication and product differentiation.
•   we lose revenues as a result of counterfeiting, contraband, cross-border purchases and non-tax-paid volume produced by local manufacturers.
large quantities of counterfeit cigarettes are sold in the international market. we believe that marlboro is the most heavily counterfeited international cigarette brand, although we cannot quantify the revenues we lose as a result of this activity. in addition, our revenues are reduced by contraband, legal cross-border purchases and non-tax-paid volume produced by local manufacturers.
•   from time to time, we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters.
investigations include allegations of contraband shipments of cigarettes, allegations of unlawful pricing activities within certain markets, allegations of underpayment of customs duties and/or excise taxes, allegations of false and misleading usage of descriptors and allegations of unlawful advertising. we cannot predict the outcome of those investigations or whether additional investigations may be commenced, and it is possible that our business could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of pending or future investigations. see item 3, legal proceedings-other litigation and item 7, business environment-governmental investigations for a description of certain governmental investigations to which we are subject.
•   we may be unsuccessful in our attempts to introduce reduced-risk products, and regulators may not permit the commercialization of these products or health-related claims.
our key strategic priorities are: to develop and commercialize products that present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to those products versus continued smoking; and to convince current adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke to switch to those rrps. for our efforts to be successful, we must: develop rrps that such adult smokers find acceptable alternatives to smoking; conduct rigorous scientific studies to substantiate that they reduce exposure to harmful and potentially harmful constituents in smoke and, ultimately, that these products present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to them versus continued smoking; and effectively advocate for the development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of rrps, including communication of scientifically substantiated information to enable adult consumers to make better health choices. we might not succeed in our efforts. if we do not succeed, but others do, we may be at a competitive disadvantage. furthermore, we cannot predict whether regulators will permit the sale and/or marketing of rrps with health-related claims. such restrictions could limit the success of our rrps.
•   our reported results could be adversely affected by unfavorable currency exchange rates, and currency devaluations could impair our competitiveness.
we conduct our business primarily in local currency and, for purposes of financial reporting the local currency results are translated into u.s. dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period. during times of a strengthening u.s. dollar, our reported net revenues and operating income will be reduced because the local currency translates into fewer u.s. dollars. during periods of local economic crises, foreign currencies may be devalued significantly against the u.s. dollar, reducing our margins. actions to recover margins may result in lower volume and a weaker competitive position.
•   the repatriation of our foreign earnings, changes in the earnings mix, and changes in tax laws may increase our effective tax rate. our ability to receive payments from foreign subsidiaries or to repatriate royalties and dividends could be restricted by local country currency exchange controls.
because we are a u.s. holding company, our most significant source of funds is distributions from our non-u.s. subsidiaries. under current u.s. tax law, in general we do not pay u.s. taxes on our foreign earnings until they are repatriated to the u.s. as distributions from our non-u.s. subsidiaries. these distributions may result in a residual u.s. tax cost. it may be advantageous to us in certain circumstances to significantly increase the amount of such distributions, which could result in a material increase in our overall effective tax rate under current u.s. tax law. furthermore, our effective tax rate could be increased due to changes in the earnings mix or applicable tax laws. in addition, certain countries in which we operate have adopted or could institute currency exchange controls that limit or prohibit our local subsidiaries' ability to convert local currency into u.s. dollars or to make payments outside the country. this could subject us to the risks of local currency devaluation and business disruption.
•   our ability to grow profitability may be limited by our inability to introduce new products, enter new markets or improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix.
our profit growth may suffer if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully, to raise prices or to improve the proportion of our sales of higher margin products and in higher margin geographies.
•   we may be unable to expand our brand portfolio through successful acquisitions or the development of strategic business relationships.
one element of our growth strategy is to strengthen our brand portfolio and market positions through selective acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships. acquisition and strategic business development opportunities are limited and present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration, strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings. there is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms, or that future acquisitions or strategic business developments will be accretive to earnings.
•   government mandated prices, production control programs, shifts in crops driven by economic conditions and the impact of climate change may increase the cost or reduce the quality of the tobacco and other agricultural products used to manufacture our products.
as with other agricultural commodities, the price of tobacco leaf and cloves can be influenced by imbalances in supply and demand, and crop quality can be influenced by variations in weather patterns, including those caused by climate change. tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls, including government mandated prices and production control programs. changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products could cause farmers to plant less tobacco. any significant change in tobacco leaf and clove prices, quality and quantity could affect our profitability and our business.
•   our ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best global talent may be impaired by the decreasing social acceptance of cigarette smoking.
•   the failure of our information systems to function as intended or their penetration by outside parties with the intent to corrupt them could result in business disruption, litigation and regulatory action, and loss of revenue, assets or personal or other sensitive data.
we use information systems to help manage business processes, collect and interpret business data and communicate internally and externally with employees, suppliers, customers and others. some of these information systems are managed by third-party service providers. we have backup systems and business continuity plans in place, and we take care to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access. nevertheless, failure of our systems to function as intended, or penetration of our systems by outside parties intent on extracting or corrupting information or otherwise disrupting business processes, could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in a loss of revenue, assets or personal or other sensitive data, litigation and regulatory action, cause damage to our reputation and that of our brands and result in significant remediation and other costs to us.
•   we may be required to replace third-party contract manufacturers or service providers with our own resources.
in certain instances, we contract with third parties to manufacture some of our products or product parts or to provide other services. we may be unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms for numerous reasons, including government regulations. accordingly, our costs may increase significantly if we must replace such third parties with our own resources.
item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on form 10-k, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in item 8, and the discussion of risks and cautionary factors that may affect future results in item 1a. risk factors.
description of our company we are a holding company whose subsidiaries and affiliates, and their licensees, are engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes, other tobacco products and other nicotine-containing products in markets outside the united states of america. we manage our business in four segments:
our products are sold in more than 180 markets, and in many of these markets they hold the number one or number two market share position. we have a wide range of premium, mid-price and low-price brands. our portfolio comprises both international and local brands. in addition to the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products, we are engaged in the development and commercialization of reduced-risk products ("rrps"). rrps is the term we use to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking.  we have a range of rrps in various stages of development, scientific assessment and commercialization.  because our rrps do not burn tobacco, they produce far lower quantities of harmful and potentially harmful compounds than found in cigarette smoke.
we use the term net revenues to refer to our operating revenues from the sale of our products, net of sales and promotion incentives. our net revenues and operating income are affected by various factors, including the volume of products we sell, the price of our products, changes in currency exchange rates and the mix of products we sell. mix is a term used to refer to the proportionate value of premium-price brands to mid-price or low-price brands in any given market (product mix). mix can also refer to the proportion of shipment volume in more profitable markets versus shipment volume in less profitable markets (geographic mix). we often collect excise taxes from our customers and then remit them to governments, and, in those circumstances, we include the excise taxes in our net revenues and in excise taxes on products. our cost of sales consists principally of tobacco leaf, non-tobacco raw materials, labor and manufacturing costs.
our marketing, administration and research costs include the costs of marketing and selling our products, other costs generally not related to the manufacture of our products (including general corporate expenses), and costs incurred to develop new products. the most significant components of our marketing, administration and research costs are marketing and sales expenses and general and administrative expenses.
philip morris international inc. is a legal entity separate and distinct from our direct and indirect subsidiaries. accordingly, our right, and thus the right of our creditors and stockholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is subject to the prior rights of creditors of such subsidiary, except to the extent that claims of our company itself as a creditor may be recognized. as a holding company, our principal sources of funds, including funds to make payment on our debt securities, are from the receipt of dividends and repayment of debt from our subsidiaries. our principal wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries currently are not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions with respect to their common stock.
•   consolidated operating results - the changes in our reported diluted earnings per share ("diluted eps") for the year ended december 31, 2016, from the comparable 2015 amounts, were as follows:
diluted eps   % growth for the year ended december 31, 2015       $4.42
2015 asset impairment and exit costs        0.03
subtotal of 2015 items                         -
2016 asset impairment and exit costs           -
subtotal of 2016 items                         -
change in tax rate                          0.03
see the discussion of events affecting the comparability of statement of earnings amounts in the consolidated operating results section of the following discussion and analysis.
•   asset impairment and exit costs - during 2015, we recorded pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs of $68 million ($52 million after tax or $0.03 per share) related to severance costs for the organizational restructuring in the european union segment. during 2016, we did not have an eps impact related to asset impairment and exit costs.
•   income taxes - our effective income tax rate for 2016 decreased by 0.1 percentage point to 27.9%. the 2015 tax items that increased our diluted eps by $0.03 per share in 2015 in the table above represents a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits of $41 million following the conclusion of the irs examinations of altria group, inc.'s ("altria") consolidated tax returns for the years 2007 and 2008 and pmi's consolidated tax returns for the years 2009 through 2011. prior to march 28, 2008, pmi was a wholly owned subsidiary of altria. the change in tax rate that increased our diluted eps by $0.03 per share in 2016 in the table above was primarily due to earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction and repatriation cost differences.
•   currency - the unfavorable currency impact during 2016 results from the strengthening of the u.s. dollar, especially against the egyptian pound, indonesian rupiah, kazakh tenge, mexican peso, russian ruble and turkish lira, partially offset by the japanese yen. this unfavorable currency movement has impacted our profitability across our primary revenue markets and local currency cost bases.
•   interest - the favorable impact of interest was due primarily to lower effective interest rates on debt and higher interest income.
•   operations - the increase in diluted eps of $0.44 from our operations in the table above was due primarily to the following segments:
•   eema: higher pricing and lower marketing, administration and research costs, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix;
•   european union: higher pricing, lower manufacturing costs and lower marketing, administration and research costs, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix;
•   asia: higher pricing and lower marketing, administration and research costs, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix; and
•   latin america &amp; canada: higher pricing, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix, higher manufacturing costs and higher marketing, administration and research costs.
for further details, see the consolidated operating results and operating results by business segment sections of the following discussion and analysis.
• 2017 forecasted results - on february 2, 2017, we announced our forecast for 2017 full-year reported diluted eps to be in a range of $4.70 to $4.85, at prevailing exchange rates at that time, versus $4.48 in 2016. excluding an unfavorable currency impact at then-prevailing exchange rates of approximately $0.18 per share for the full-year 2017, the reported diluted earnings per share range represents an increase of approximately 9% to 12% versus adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.48 in 2016. this forecast reflects net revenue growth, excluding excise taxes, in excess of our current annual growth target range of 4%-6%, excluding currency and acquisitions. this forecast does not include any share repurchases in 2017.
our 2016 reported and adjusted diluted eps was $4.48. during 2016, we did not have an eps impact related to asset impairment and exit costs, and discrete tax items.
adjusted diluted eps is not a measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america ("u.s. gaap"). we define adjusted diluted eps as reported diluted eps adjusted for asset impairment and exit costs, discrete tax items and unusual items. we believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure as it represents core earnings, improves comparability and helps investors analyze business performance and trends. adjusted diluted eps should be considered neither in isolation nor as a substitute for reported diluted eps prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap.
this 2017 guidance excludes the impact of any future acquisitions, unanticipated asset impairment and exit cost charges, future changes in currency exchange rates and any unusual events. the factors described in item 1a. risk factors represent continuing risks to this forecast.

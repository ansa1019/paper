item 1a:   risk factors the following risk factors could materially and adversely affect applied's business, financial condition or results of operations and cause reputational harm, and should be carefully considered in evaluating the company and its business, in addition to other information presented elsewhere in this report.
as a supplier to the global semiconductor and display and related industries, applied is subject to business cycles, the timing, length and volatility of which can be difficult to predict and which vary among its businesses. these industries historically have been cyclical and are subject to volatility and sudden changes in customer requirements for new manufacturing capacity and advanced technology, which depend on several factors, including general economic conditions, end-user demand, customers' capacity utilization, production volumes, access to affordable capital, consumer buying patterns, inventory levels relative to demand, and technology transitions. these changes can affect the timing and amounts of customer investments in technology and manufacturing equipment, and can have a significant impact on applied's net sales, operating expenses, gross margins and net income. the amount and mix of capital equipment spending between different products and technologies can have a significant impact on the results of operations of applied's semiconductor systems segment, which is the largest contributor to its consolidated net sales.
to meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves, applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity across its businesses, and may incur unexpected or additional costs to align its business operations. during periods of increasing demand for its products, applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand; effectively manage its supply chain; attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees; and continue to control costs. during periods of decreasing demand, applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions; effectively manage its supply chain; and motivate and retain key employees. if applied does not effectively manage these challenges during periods of changing demand, its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted. even with effective allocation of resources and management of costs, during periods of decreasing demand, applied's gross margins and earnings may be adversely impacted.
applied is exposed to risks associated with an uncertain global economy.
uncertain global economic and business conditions, along with uncertainties in the financial markets, national debt and fiscal concerns in various regions, pose challenges to the industries in which applied operates. markets for semiconductors and displays depend largely on business and consumer spending and demand for electronic products. economic uncertainty and related factors exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause certain applied customers to push out, cancel, or refrain from purchasing for equipment or services, which may have an adverse impact on applied's revenues, results of operations and financial condition. uncertain market conditions, difficulties in obtaining capital, or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, which can also result in lower sales, additional inventory or bad debt expense for applied. economic and industry uncertainty may similarly affect suppliers, which could impair their ability to deliver parts and negatively affect applied's ability to manage operations and deliver its products. these conditions may also lead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect applied's ability to compete effectively.
uncertain economic and industry conditions also make it more challenging for applied to forecast its operating results, make business decisions, and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its businesses, sources and uses of cash, financial condition and results of operations. if applied does not appropriately manage its business operations, it could have a significant negative impact on its business performance and financial condition. applied may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts, including restructuring activities, which may adversely affect applied's ability to capitalize on opportunities. even during periods of economic uncertainty or lower revenues, applied must continue to invest in research and development and maintain a global business infrastructure to compete effectively and support its customers, which can have a negative impact on its operating margins and earnings.
applied maintains an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. the risks to applied's investment portfolio may be exacerbated if financial market conditions deteriorate and, as a result, the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio, as well as returns on pension assets, could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges. applied also maintains cash balances in various bank accounts globally in order to fund normal operations. if any of these financial institutions becomes insolvent, it could limit applied's ability to access cash in the affected accounts, which could affect its ability to manage its operations.
applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the various industries in which it operates.
the global semiconductor, display and related industries in which applied operates are characterized by ongoing changes affecting some or all of these industries that impact demand for and the profitability of applied's products, including:
•   the nature, timing and degree of visibility of changes in end demand for electronic products, including those related to fluctuations in consumer buying patterns tied to seasonality or the introduction of new products, and the effects of these changes on foundry and other customers' businesses and on demand for applied's products;
•   increasing capital requirements for building and operating new fabrication plants and customers' ability to raise the necessary capital;
•   regulatory or tax policies impacting the timing of customers' investment in new or expanded fabrication plants;
•   differences in growth rates among the semiconductor, display and other industries in which applied operates;
•   the increasing importance of establishing, improving and maintaining strong relationships with customers;
•   the increasing cost and complexity for customers to move from product design to volume manufacturing, which may slow the adoption rate of new manufacturing technology;
•   the need for customers to continually reduce the total cost of manufacturing system ownership;
•   the heightened importance to customers of system reliability and productivity and the effect on demand for fabrication systems as a result of their increasing productivity, device yield and reliability;
•   manufacturers' ability to reconfigure and re-use fabrication systems which can reduce demand for new equipment;
•   the increasing importance of, and difficulties in, developing products with sufficient differentiation to influence customers' purchasing decisions;
•   requirements for shorter cycle times for the development, manufacture and installation of manufacturing equipment;
•   price and performance trends for semiconductor devices and displays, and the corresponding effect on demand for such products;
•   the increasing importance of the availability of spare parts to maximize the time that customers' systems are available for production;
•   the increasing role for and complexity of software in applied products; and
•   the increasing focus on reducing energy usage and improving the environmental impact and sustainability associated with manufacturing operations.
applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the semiconductor industry.
the largest proportion of applied's consolidated net sales and profitability is derived from sales of manufacturing equipment in the semiconductor systems segment to the global semiconductor industry. in addition, a majority of the revenues of applied global services is from sales to semiconductor manufacturers. the semiconductor industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and the profitability of applied's semiconductor equipment and service products, including:
•   the increasing cost of research and development due to many factors, including decreasing linewidths on a chip, the use of new materials, new and more complex device structures, more applications and process steps, increasing chip design costs, and the increasing cost and complexity of integrated manufacturing processes;
•   the need to reduce product development time, despite the increasing difficulty of technical challenges;
•   the growing number of types and varieties of semiconductors and number of applications across multiple substrate sizes;
•   the increasing cost and complexity for semiconductor manufacturers to move more technically advanced capability and smaller linewidths to volume manufacturing, and the resulting impact on the rates of technology transition and investment in capital equipment;
•   challenges in generating organic growth given semiconductor manufacturers' levels of capital expenditures and the allocation of capital investment to market segments that applied does not serve, such as lithography, or segments where applied's products have lower relative market presence;
•   the importance of increasing market positions in segments with growing demand;
•   semiconductor manufacturer's ability to reconfigure and re-use equipment, and the resulting effect on their need to purchase new equipment and services;
•   the increasing frequency and complexity of technology transitions and inflections, such as 3-d transistors and advanced interconnects, and applied's ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to these changes;
•   shorter cycle times between order placements by customers and product shipment require greater reliance on forecasting of customer investment, which may lead to inventory write-offs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease gross margin;
•   competitive factors that make it difficult to enhance position, including challenges in securing development-tool-of-record (dtor) and production-tool-of-record (ptor) positions with customers;
•   shifts in sourcing strategies by computer and electronics companies that impact the equipment requirements of applied's foundry customers;
•   the concentration of new wafer starts in korea and taiwan, where applied's service penetration and service-revenue-per-wafer-start have been lower than in other regions;
•   investment in semiconductor manufacturing capabilities in china, and its effect on the demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment; and
•   the increasing fragmentation of semiconductor markets, leading certain markets to become too small to support the cost of a new fabrication plant, while others require less technologically advanced products.
if applied does not accurately forecast, and allocate appropriate resources and investment towards addressing, key technology changes and inflections, successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new technologies, and effectively address industry trends, its business and results of operations may be adversely impacted.
applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the display industry.
the global display industry historically has experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment investment levels, due in part to the limited number of display manufacturers, the concentrated nature of end-use applications, production capacity relative to end-use demand, and panel manufacturer profitability. industry growth depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced tvs, and on demand for advanced smartphones and mobile device displays, which demand is highly sensitive to cost and improvements in technologies and features. the display industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and the profitability of applied's display products, including:
•   the importance of new types of display technologies, such as organic light-emitting diode (oled), low temperature polysilicon (ltps), flexible displays and metal oxide, and new touch panel films;
•   the timing and extent of an expansion of manufacturing facilities in china, which may be affected by changes in economic conditions in china;
•   the rate of transition to larger substrate sizes for tvs and to new display technologies for tvs and mobile applications, and the resulting effect on capital intensity in the industry and on applied's product differentiation, gross margin and return on investment; and
•   the variability in demand for display manufacturing equipment, and uncertainty with respect to future display technology end-use applications and growth drivers.
if applied does not successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new and emerging display technologies, or if industry demand for display manufacturing equipment and technologies slows, applied's business and its results of operations may be adversely impacted.
the industries in which applied operates are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market changes.
applied operates in a highly competitive environment in which innovation is critical, and its future success depends on many factors, including the development of new technologies and effective commercialization and customer acceptance of its equipment, services and related products. in order to successfully grow its businesses, applied must increase its position in its current markets, expand into adjacent and new markets, and optimize operational performance. the development, introduction and support of a broadening set of products in a geographically diverse and competitive environment, and that may require greater collaboration with customers and other industry participants, have grown more complex and expensive over time. furthermore, new or improved products may entail higher costs and lower profits. to compete successfully, applied must:
•   identify and address technology inflections, market changes, new applications, customer requirements and end-use demand;
•   develop new products and disruptive technologies, improve and develop new applications for existing products, and adapt products for use by customers in different applications and markets with varying technical requirements;
•   differentiate its products from those of competitors, meet customers' performance specifications, appropriately price products, and achieve market acceptance;
•   maintain operating flexibility to enable responses to changing markets, applications, customers and customer requirements;
•   enhance its worldwide operations across its businesses to reduce cycle time, enable continuous quality improvement, reduce costs, and enhance design for manufacturability and serviceability;
•   focus on product development and sales and marketing strategies that address customers' high value problems and strengthen customer relationships;
•   effectively allocate resources between its existing products and markets, the development of new products, and expanding into new and adjacent markets;
•   improve the productivity of capital invested in r&amp;d activities;
•   improve its manufacturing processes and achieve cost efficiencies across product offerings;
•   adapt to changes in value offered by companies in different parts of the supply chain;
•   qualify products for evaluation and volume manufacturing with its customers; and
•   implement changes in its design engineering methodology to reduce material costs and cycle time, increase commonality of platforms and types of parts used in different systems, and improve product life cycle management.
if applied does not successfully anticipate technology inflections, develop and commercialize new products and technologies, and respond to changes in customer requirements and market trends, its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted.
applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base.
applied's customer base is highly concentrated, and has become increasingly concentrated as a result of continued consolidation. applied's customer base is also geographically concentrated. a relatively limited number of manufacturers account for a substantial portion of applied's business. as a result, the actions of even a single customer can expose applied's business and results of operations to greater volatility. the mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year, and have a significant impact on applied's net sales, gross margins and net income. applied's products are configured to customer specifications, and changing, rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant, non-recoverable costs. if customers do not place orders, or they substantially reduce, delay or cancel orders, applied may not be able to replace the business, which may have a significant adverse impact on its results of operations and financial condition. the concentration of applied's customer base increases its risks related to the financial condition of its customers, and the deterioration in financial condition of a single customer or the failure of a single customer to perform its obligations could have a material adverse effect on applied's results of operations and cash flow. to the extent its customers experience liquidity constraints, applied may incur additional bad debt expense, which may have a significant impact on its results of operations. major customers may also seek pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that are less favorable to applied, which may have a negative impact on applied's business, revenue and gross margins.
applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business.
applied has product development, engineering, manufacturing, sales and other operations in many countries, and some of its business activities are concentrated in certain geographic areas. moreover, in fiscal 2016, approximately 89 percent of applied's net sales were to customers in regions outside the united states. as a result of the global nature of its operations, applied's business performance and results of operations may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:
•   varying regional economic and geopolitical business conditions and demands;
•   political and social attitudes, laws, rules, regulations and policies within countries that favor domestic companies over non-domestic companies, including customer- or government-supported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors;
•   customer- or government-supported efforts to influence applied to conduct more of its operations and sourcing in a particular country, such as korea and china;
•   variations among, and changes in, local, regional, national or international laws and regulations, including contract, intellectual property, labor, tax, and import/export laws, and the interpretation and application of such laws and regulations;
•   ineffective or inadequate legal protection of intellectual property rights in certain countries;
•   positions taken by governmental agencies regarding possible national commercial and/or security issues posed by international business operations;
•   geographically diverse operations and projects, which require an effective organizational structure and allocation of resources, and appropriate business processes, procedures and controls;
•   supply chain interruptions, and service interruptions from utilities, transportation, data hosting or telecommunications providers;
•   a diverse workforce with different experience levels, languages, cultures, customs, business practices and worker expectations, and differing employment practices and labor issues;
•   variations in the ability to develop relationships with local customers, suppliers and governments;
•   fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates, including the relative strength or weakness of the u.s. dollar against the japanese yen, euro, taiwanese dollar, israeli shekel, chinese yuan or singapore dollar;
•   the need to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations around the world;
•   political instability, natural disasters, pandemics, social unrest, terrorism or acts of war in locations where applied has operations, suppliers or sales, or that may influence the value chain of the industries that applied serves;
•   hiring and integration of an increasing number of workers in new countries;
•   uncertainties with respect to economic growth rates in various countries, including for the manufacture and sale of semiconductors and displays in the developing economies of certain countries.
many of these challenges are present in china and korea, which are experiencing significant growth of customers, suppliers and competitors to applied. applied further believes that china and korea present large potential markets for its products and opportunity for growth over the long term, although at lower projected levels of profitability and margins for certain products than historically have been achieved in other regions. in addition, government authorities may impose conditions that require the use of local suppliers or partnerships with local companies, require the license or other transfer of intellectual property, or engage in other efforts to promote local businesses and local competitors, which could have a significant adverse impact on applied's business.
applied is exposed to risks associated with business combinations, acquisitions and strategic investments.
applied engages in acquisitions of or investments in companies, technologies or products in existing, related or new markets for applied. business combinations, acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks to applied's business, financial condition and operating results, including but not limited to:
•   diversion of management's attention and disruption of ongoing businesses;
•   contractual restrictions on the conduct of applied's business during the pendency of a proposed transaction;
•   the failure to realize expected returns from acquired businesses;
•   requirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures and restrictions on the conduct of applied's existing business or the acquired business;
•   ineffective integration of operations, systems, technologies, products or employees, which can impact the ability to realize anticipated synergies or other benefits;
•   failure to commercialize technologies from acquired businesses or developed through strategic investments;
•   inability to capitalize on characteristics of new markets that may be significantly different from applied's existing markets and where competitors may have stronger market positions and customer relationships;
•   failure to retain and motivate key employees of acquired businesses;
•   the potential impact of the announcement or consummation of a proposed transaction on relationships with third parties;
•   potential changes in applied's credit rating, which could adversely impact the company's access to and cost of capital;
•   reductions in cash balances or increases in debt obligations to finance activities associated with a transaction, which reduce the availability of cash flow for general corporate or other purposes, including share repurchases and dividends;
•   exposure to new operational risks, rules, regulations, worker expectations, customs and practices to the extent acquired businesses are located in regions where applied has not historically conducted business;
•   inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company's internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices;
•   impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions, technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the segment;
•   the risk of litigation or claims associated with a proposed or completed transaction;
•   unknown, underestimated or undisclosed commitments or liabilities; and
•   the inappropriate scale of acquired entities' critical resources or facilities for business needs.
applied also makes strategic investments in other companies, including companies formed as joint ventures, which may decline in value or not meet desired objectives. the success of these investments depends on various factors over which applied may have limited or no control and, particularly with respect to joint ventures, requires ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic partners. the risks to applied's strategic investment portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions and, as a result, the value of the investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges.
applied's indebtedness and debt covenants could adversely affect its financial condition and business.
applied has $3.4 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding. under the indenture governing the senior unsecured notes, it may be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon a change of control of applied and a contemporaneous downgrade of the notes below investment grade. applied also has in place a $1.5 billion committed revolving credit agreement. while no amounts were outstanding under this credit agreement at october 30, 2016, applied may borrow amounts in the future under the agreement. applied may also enter into new financing arrangements. applied's ability to satisfy its debt obligations is dependent upon the results of its business operations and subject to other risks discussed in this section. significant changes in applied's credit rating or changes in the interest rate environment could have a material adverse consequence on applied's access to and cost of capital for future financings, and financial condition. if applied fails to satisfy its debt obligations, or comply with financial and other debt covenants, it may be in default and any borrowings may become immediately due and payable, and such default may also constitute a default under other of applied's obligations. there can be no assurance that applied would have sufficient financial resources or be able to arrange financing to repay any borrowings at such time.
applied is exposed to risks associated with expanding into new and related markets and industries.
as part of its growth strategy, applied must successfully expand into related or new markets and industries, either with its existing products or with new products developed internally, or those developed in collaboration with third parties, or obtained through acquisitions. applied's ability to successfully expand its business into new and related markets and industries may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:
•   the need to devote additional resources to develop new products for, and operate in, new markets;
•   the need to develop new sales and technical marketing strategies, cultivate relationships with new customers and meet different customer service requirements;
•   differing rates of profitability and growth among multiple businesses;
•   applied's ability to anticipate demand, capitalize on opportunities, and avoid or minimize risks;
•   the complexity of managing multiple businesses with variations in production planning, execution, supply chain management and logistics;
•   the adoption of new business models, business processes and systems;
•   the complexity of entering into and effectively managing strategic alliances or partnering opportunities;
•   new materials, processes and technologies;
•   the need to attract, motivate and retain employees with skills and expertise in these new areas;
•   new and more diverse customers and suppliers, including some with limited operating histories, uncertain or limited funding, evolving business models or locations in regions where applied does not have, or has limited, operations;
•   new or different competitors with potentially more financial or other resources, industry experience and established customer relationships;
•   entry into new industries and countries, with differing levels of government involvement, laws and regulations, and business, employment and safety practices;
•   the need to comply with, or work to establish, industry standards and practices.
in addition, applied from time to time receives funding from united states and other government agencies for certain strategic development programs to increase its research and development resources and address new market opportunities. as a condition to this government funding, applied may be subject to certain record-keeping, audit, intellectual property rights-sharing and/or other obligations.
manufacturing interruptions or delays could affect applied's ability to meet customer demand and lead to higher costs, while the failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete inventory.
applied's business depends on its timely supply of equipment, services and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of its customers, which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts, including components and subassemblies, from suppliers, including contract manufacturers. some key parts are subject to long lead-times or obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers, and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers located in countries other than the countries where applied conducts its manufacturing, including china and korea. variable industry conditions and the volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment increase capital, technical, operational and other risks for applied and for companies throughout its supply chain. these conditions may cause some suppliers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other companies, or file for bankruptcy protection and possibly cease operations. applied may also experience significant interruptions of its manufacturing operations, delays in its ability to deliver products or services, increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of:
•   the failure or inability of suppliers to timely deliver sufficient quantities of quality parts on a cost-effective basis;
•   volatility in the availability and cost of materials, including rare earth elements;
•   shipment delays due to transportation interruptions or capacity constraints;
•   information technology or infrastructure failures; and
•   natural disasters or other events beyond applied's control (such as earthquakes, floods or storms, regional economic downturns, pandemics, social unrest, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war), particularly where it conducts manufacturing.
if a supplier fails to meet applied's requirements concerning quality, cost, protection of intellectual property, socially-responsible business practices, or other performance factors, applied may transfer its business to alternative sources, which could entail manufacturing delays, additional costs, or other difficulties. if applied is unable to meet its customers' demand for a prolonged period due to its inability to obtain certain parts or components, it could affect its ability to manage its operations, and have an adverse impact on applied's business, results of operations and customer relationships. in addition, if applied needs to rapidly increase its business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules, this may exacerbate any interruptions in applied's manufacturing operations and supply chain and the associated effect on applied's working capital. moreover, if actual demand for applied's products is different than expected, applied may purchase more/fewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or expediting delivery of parts. if applied purchases inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize, or if customers reduce or delay orders, applied may incur excess inventory charges.
the ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital to applied's success.
applied's success, competitiveness and ability to execute on its global strategies and maintain a culture of innovation depend in large part on its ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees. achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, management changes, applied's organizational structure, global competition for talent and the availability of qualified employees, cost reduction activities (including workforce reductions and unpaid shutdowns), availability of career development opportunities, the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries, and the effectiveness of applied's compensation and benefit programs, including its share-based programs. restructuring programs present particular challenges to the extent they involve the departure of knowledgeable and experienced employees and the resulting need to identify and train existing or new workers to perform necessary functions, which may result in unexpected costs, reduced productivity, and/or difficulties with respect to internal processes and controls.
applied is exposed to various risks related to protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights.
applied's success depends in significant part on the protection of its patents, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property rights. infringement of applied's rights by a third party, such as the unauthorized manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts, could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for applied. policing any unauthorized use of intellectual property is difficult and costly and applied cannot be certain that the measures it has implemented will prevent misuse. applied's ability to enforce its intellectual property rights is subject to litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the protection and enforceability of those rights in some countries. if applied seeks to enforce its intellectual property rights, it may be subject to claims that those rights are invalid or unenforceable, and others may seek counterclaims against applied, which could have a negative impact on its business. if applied is unable to enforce and protect intellectual property rights, or if they are circumvented, invalidated, rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, it could have an adverse impact on its competitive position and business. in addition, changes in intellectual property laws or their interpretation, such as recent changes in u.s. patent laws, may impact applied's ability to protect and assert its intellectual property rights, increase costs and uncertainties in the prosecution of patent applications and enforcement or defense of issued patents, and diminish the value of applied's intellectual property.
third parties may also assert claims against applied and its products. claims that applied's products infringe the rights of others, whether or not meritorious, can be expensive and time-consuming to defend and resolve, and may divert the efforts and attention of management and personnel. the inability to obtain rights to use third party intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could have an adverse impact on applied's business. in addition, applied may face claims based on the theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets and other confidential business information. any such incidents and claims could severely harm applied's business and reputation, result in significant expenses, harm its competitive position, and prevent applied from selling certain products, all of which could have a significant adverse impact on applied's business and results of operations.
applied is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and incidents.
in the conduct of its business, applied collects, uses, transmits and stores data on information technology systems. this data includes confidential information belonging to applied or its customers or other business partners, as well as personally-identifiable information of individuals. applied has experienced, and expects to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents, ranging from employee error or misuse to individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, none of which have been material to the company to date. applied devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption and other measures to protect its systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse. however, depending on their nature and scope, cybersecurity incidents could result in business disruption; the misappropriation, corruption or loss of confidential information and critical data (applied's and that of third parties); reputational damage; litigation with third parties; diminution in the value of applied's investment in research, development and engineering; data privacy issues; and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs.
applied is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings.
applied from time to time is, and in the future may be, involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement, intellectual property rights, antitrust, environmental regulations, securities, contracts, product performance, product liability, unfair competition, misappropriation of trade secrets, employment, workplace safety, and other matters. applied also on occasion receives notification from customers who believe that applied owes them indemnification or other obligations related to claims made against such customers by third parties.
legal proceedings and claims, whether with or without merit, and associated internal investigations, may be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute, defend or conduct; divert management's attention and other applied resources; inhibit applied's ability to sell its products; result in adverse judgments for damages, injunctive relief, penalties and fines; and negatively affect applied's business. there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings, claims or investigations.
the failure to successfully implement and conduct outsourcing activities and other operational initiatives could adversely affect results of operations.
to better align its costs with market conditions, locate closer to customers, enhance productivity, and improve efficiencies, applied conducts certain engineering, software development, manufacturing, sourcing and other operations in regions outside the united states, including india, taiwan, china, and korea. applied has implemented a distributed manufacturing model, under which certain manufacturing and supply chain activities are conducted in various countries, including germany, israel, italy, singapore, taiwan, the united states and other countries in asia, and assembly of some systems is completed at customer sites. in addition, applied outsources certain functions to third parties, including companies in the united states, india, china, korea, malaysia and other countries. outsourced functions include contract manufacturing, engineering, customer support, software development, information technology support, finance and administrative activities. the expanding role of third party providers has required changes to applied's existing operations and the adoption of new procedures and processes for retaining and managing these providers, as well as redistributing responsibilities as warranted, in order to realize the potential productivity and operational efficiencies, assure quality and continuity of supply, and protect the intellectual property of applied and its customers, suppliers and other partners. if applied does not accurately forecast the amount, timing and mix of demand for products, or if contract manufacturers or other outsource providers fail to perform in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, applied's ability to meet customer requirements could suffer, particularly during a market upturn.
in addition, applied must regularly implement or update comprehensive programs and processes to better align its global organizations, including initiatives to enhance its supply chain and improve back office and information technology infrastructure for more efficient transaction processing. the implementation of new processes and information systems and additional functionality to the existing systems entails certain risks, including difficulties with changes in business processes that could disrupt applied's operations, such as its ability to track orders and timely ship products, project inventory requirements, manage its supply chain and aggregate financial and operational data. during transitions applied must continue to rely on legacy information systems, which may be costly or inefficient, while the implementation of new initiatives may not achieve the anticipated benefits and may divert management's attention from other operational activities, or have other unintended consequences.
if applied does not effectively develop and implement its outsourcing and relocation strategies, if required export and other governmental approvals are not timely obtained, if applied's third party providers do not perform as anticipated, if there are delays or difficulties in enhancing business processes or if there are delays or difficulties in implementing or enhancing information systems, applied may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies, and may experience operational difficulties, increased costs (including energy and transportation), manufacturing interruptions or delays, inefficiencies in the structure and/or operation of its supply chain, loss of its intellectual property rights, quality issues, reputational harm, increased product time-to-market, and/or inefficient allocation of human resources, all of which could adversely affect applied's business, financial condition and results of operations.
applied may incur impairment charges to goodwill or long-lived assets.
applied has a significant amount of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions. goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. the review compares the fair value for each of applied's reporting units to its associated carrying value, including goodwill. factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include adverse industry or economic trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, declines in the market price of applied common stock, changes in applied's strategies or product portfolio, and restructuring activities. applied's valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance. applied may be required to record future charges to earnings during the period in which an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets is determined to exist.
applied is exposed to risks associated with operating in jurisdictions with complex and changing tax laws.
applied is subject to income taxes in the united states and foreign jurisdictions. significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities. applied's provision for income taxes and effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in: (1) applicable tax laws; (2) amount and composition of pre-tax income in jurisdictions with differing tax rates; (3) plans to indefinitely reinvest certain funds held outside of the u.s.; and (4) valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. an increase in applied's provision for income taxes and effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on applied's results of operations and financial condition. as of october 30, 2016, applied intends to indefinitely reinvest approximately $3.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries and does not plan to repatriate these funds. applied would need to accrue and pay u.s. taxes if these funds were repatriated.
consistent with the international nature of its business, applied conducts certain manufacturing, supply chain, and other operations in asia, bringing these activities closer to customers and reducing operating costs. in certain foreign jurisdictions, conditional reduced income tax rates have been granted to applied. to obtain the benefit of these tax incentives, applied must meet requirements relating to various activities. applied's ability to realize benefits from these incentives could be materially affected if, among other things, applicable requirements are not met or applied incurs net losses in these jurisdictions.
in addition, applied is subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities, and from time to time amends previously filed tax returns. applied regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and amendments to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes, which requires estimates and judgments. although applied believes its tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the tax authorities will agree with such estimates. applied may have to engage in litigation to achieve the results reflected in the estimates, which may be time-consuming and expensive. there can be no assurance that applied will be successful or that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in applied's historical income tax provisions and effective tax rates.
applied is subject to risks associated with environmental and safety regulations.
applied is subject to environmental and safety regulations in connection with its global business operations, including but not limited to: regulations related to the development, manufacture and use of its products; handling, discharge, recycling and disposal of hazardous materials used in its products or in producing its products; the operation of its facilities; and the use of its real property. the failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental and safety regulations could result in: significant remediation or other legal liabilities; the imposition of penalties and fines; restrictions on the development, manufacture, sale or use of certain of its products; limitations on the operation of its facilities or ability to use its real property; and a decrease in the value of its real property. applied could be required to alter its manufacturing and operations and incur substantial expense in order to comply with environmental and safety regulations. any failure to comply with environmental and safety regulations could subject applied to significant costs and liabilities that could adversely affect applied's business, financial condition and results of operations.
applied is exposed to various risks related to the global regulatory environment.
as a public company with global operations, applied is subject to the laws of the united states and multiple foreign jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions, including those related to financial and other disclosures, corporate governance, intellectual property, tax, trade, anti-competition, employment, immigration, privacy, and anti-corruption. changing, inconsistent or conflicting laws, rules and regulations, and ambiguities in their interpretation and application, create uncertainty and challenges, and compliance with laws, rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive, divert management time and attention from revenue-generating activities, and otherwise adversely impact applied's business operations. violations of law, rules and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions, restrictions on applied's business, and damage to its reputation, and could have an adverse impact on its business operations, financial condition and results of operations.
item 7:   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) is intended to facilitate an understanding of applied's business and results of operations. this md&a should be read in conjunction with applied's consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k. the following discussion contains forward-looking statements and should also be read in conjunction with the cautionary statement set forth at the beginning of this form 10-k. md&a consists of the following sections:
•   overview: a summary of applied's business and measurements
•   results of operations: a discussion of operating results
•   segment information: a discussion of segment operating results
•   recent accounting pronouncements: a discussion of new accounting pronouncements and its impact to applied's consolidated financial statements
•   financial condition, liquidity and capital resources: an analysis of cash flows, sources and uses of cash
•   off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations
•   critical accounting policies and estimates: a discussion of critical accounting policies that require the exercise of judgments and estimates
•   non-gaap adjusted results: a presentation of results reconciling gaap to non-gaap adjusted measures overview applied provides manufacturing equipment, services and software to the global semiconductor, display, and related industries. applied's customers include manufacturers of semiconductor wafers and chips, liquid crystal and other displays, and other electronic devices. these customers may use what they manufacture in their own end products or sell the items to other companies for use in advanced electronic components. applied operates in three reportable segments: semiconductor systems (previously silicon systems), applied global services, and display and adjacent markets (previously display). a summary of financial information for each reportable segment is found in note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements. a discussion of factors that could affect applied's operations is set forth under "risk factors" in part i, item 1a, which is incorporated herein by reference. product development and manufacturing activities occur primarily in the united states, europe, israel, and asia. applied's broad range of equipment and service products are highly technical and are sold primarily through a direct sales force.
applied's results are driven primarily by worldwide demand for semiconductors and displays, which in turn depends on end-user demand for electronic products. each of applied's businesses is subject to variable industry conditions, as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for chips, display technologies, and other electronic devices, as well as other factors, such as global economic and market conditions, and the nature and timing of technological advances in fabrication processes. in addition, a significant driver in the semiconductor and display industries is end-demand for mobile consumer products, which is characterized by seasonality that impacts the timing of customer investments in manufacturing equipment and, in turn, applied's business. in light of these conditions, applied's results can vary significantly year-over-year, as well as quarter-over-quarter.

reconciliations of non-gaap adjusted measures are presented below under "non-gaap adjusted results." fiscal 2016 contained 53 weeks and fiscal 2015 and 2014 each contained 52 weeks.
applied's strategic priorities include developing products that help solve customers' challenges at technology inflections; expanding its served market opportunities in the semiconductor and display industries; and growing its services business.
mobility, and the increasing technological functionality of mobile devices, continues to be a strong driver of semiconductor industry spending. during fiscal 2016, memory manufacturers invested in technology upgrades and additional capacity, both of which were driven primarily by the transition from planar nand to 3d nand. foundry customers also invested in technology upgrades and new capacity to meet demand for advanced mobile chips. mobility investments, including increasing investments in new technology such as oled for mobile devices, represents a significant driver of display industry spending, which has resulted in higher manufacturing capacity expansion for mobile applications. as a result, new orders for display equipment increased in fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year. demand for larger lcd tvs is also a factor for display industry investments, although demand for tv manufacturing equipment remains susceptible to cyclical conditions.
in fiscal 2017, applied expects these trends to continue to drive demand for the semiconductor industry, and in turn for the semiconductor systems segment. applied also expects healthy spending in semiconductor spares and services, and increased spending for display manufacturing equipment in fiscal 2017.
effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, applied began to account for its flexible coating systems (previously in energy and environmental solutions) and display upgrade equipment (previously in applied global services) under the display and adjacent markets segment. as a result of the change, applied's solar business (previously in energy and environmental solutions) is included in corporate and other as it did not meet the threshold for a separate reportable segment. results for prior periods have been recast to conform to the current presentation.
results of operations new orders new orders for the periods indicated were as follows:

new orders for fiscal 2016 increased across all segments compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher demand for display and semiconductor equipment. new orders for the semiconductor systems segment continued to comprise the majority of applied's consolidated total new orders.
new orders for fiscal 2015 slightly increased from fiscal 2014 due to higher demand for semiconductor equipment, and semiconductor spares and services, partially offset by lower demand for display equipment.
new orders by geographic region for each fiscal year, determined by the product shipment destination specified by the customer, were as follows:
change the increase in new orders from customers in taiwan, europe and southeast asia in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to higher demand for semiconductor equipment, and the increase in new orders in china in fiscal 2016 reflected increased demand for semiconductor and display equipment. the increase in new orders from customers in korea in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to higher demand for display equipment. the decrease in new orders from customers in japan in fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year was primarily attributed to lower orders from memory customers, partially offset by higher demand for display equipment.
the changes in new orders from customers in korea, japan, the united states and europe in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 primarily reflected changes in customer mix for semiconductor equipment.
changes in backlog during each fiscal year were as follows:
net adjustments          (155   )            (220   )
backlog consists of: (1) orders for which written authorizations have been accepted and assigned shipment dates are within the next 12 months, or shipment has occurred but revenue has not been recognized; and (2) contractual service revenue and maintenance fees to be earned within the next 12 months. applied's backlog at any particular time is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future periods due to the potential for customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders. approximately 64 percent of backlog as of the end of fiscal 2016 is anticipated to be shipped within the next two quarters.
applied's backlog was $4.6 billion at october 30, 2016 compared to $3.1 billion at october 25, 2015. backlog adjustments were negative for fiscal 2016 and totaled $155 million, primarily due to change in expected timing of shipments, order cancellations and other adjustments, partially offset by favorable foreign currency impact. backlog adjustments were also negative for fiscal 2015 and totaled $220 million, primarily consisting of order cancellations, unfavorable foreign currency impacts and other adjustments.
backlog as of the end of the most recent two fiscal years was as follows:
2016                                                                                   2015                change semiconductor systems             $2,098              45%           $1,720              55%                   22%

net sales in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 increased primarily due to increased customer investments in semiconductor and display equipment. the semiconductor systems segment's relative share of total net sales remained flat compared to the prior year and remains the largest contributor of net sales.
net sales increased in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to greater customer investments in semiconductor spares and services, 200mm equipment systems and display and semiconductor equipment.
net sales by geographic region, determined by the location of customers' facilities to which products were shipped, were as follows:
change the changes in net sales in all regions for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 reflected increased spending on semiconductor equipment and changes in customer mix for semiconductor equipment. the changes in net sales in korea, japan and china also reflected changes in customer mix for display equipment.
the changes in net sales in korea, japan and taiwan in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily reflected changes in customer mix for semiconductor equipment. the decrease in net sales in the united states was due to lower customer spending on semiconductor equipment, partially offset by increased spending on semiconductor spares and services, and 200mm equipment.

gross profit, non-gaap adjusted gross profit, gross margin and non-gaap adjusted gross margin in fiscal 2016 increased compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher net sales, partially offset by unfavorable changes in product mix.
gross profit and non-gaap adjusted gross profit in fiscal 2015 increased compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to higher net sales, while gross margin and non-gaap adjusted gross margin decreased primarily due to unfavorable changes in product mix and the absence of a recovery of a regional customs duty assessment charge recorded in fiscal 2014.
gross profit and non-gaap adjusted gross profit during fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 included $62 million, $57 million and $53 million, respectively, of share-based compensation expense.
research, development and engineering research, development and engineering (rd&e) expenses for the periods indicated were as follows:
change research, development and engineering      $1,540              $1,451              $1,428          $89                     $23
applied's future operating results depend to a considerable extent on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the equipment and service products it provides. development cycles range from 12 to 36 months depending on whether the product is an enhancement of an existing product, which typically has a shorter development cycle, or a new product, which typically has a longer development cycle. most of applied's existing products resulted from internal development activities and innovations involving new technologies, materials and processes. in certain instances, applied acquires technologies, either in existing or new product areas, to complement its existing technology capabilities and to reduce time to market.
management believes that it is critical to continue to make substantial investments in rd&e to assure the availability of innovative technology that meets the current and projected requirements of its customers' most advanced designs. applied has maintained and intends to continue its commitment to investing in rd&e in order to continue to offer new products and technologies.
in fiscal 2016, applied increased its rd&e investments in new product growth across semiconductor systems and display and adjacent markets, including etch, e-beam inspection, new materials engineering solutions to improve transistor performance and oled displays. applied's investments in etch were focused on supporting the adoption of the producer® selectratm etch system, an extreme selectivity etch tool for enabling continued scaling of 3d logic and memory chips. the investment in e-beam inspection was in support of the provisiontm system, which helps achieve higher yields at advanced nodes by detecting the most challenging defects and monitoring process marginality. applied also invested in materials engineering solutions to improve transistor performance by lowering the contact resistance between the transistor and interconnect wiring. in display and adjacent markets, rd&e investments were focused on expanding the company's market opportunity with a new high-resolution inline e-beam review system and forthcoming solutions to improve oled and flexible display manufacturing.
rd&e expenses increased in fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year and also in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014, reflecting the impact of ongoing investments in product development initiatives. as part of its growth strategy, applied continued to reprioritize existing spend, to enable increased funding for investments in technical capabilities and critical rd&e programs in current and new markets, with a focus on semiconductor technologies. rd&e expense during fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 included $76 million, $69 million and $66 million, respectively, of share-based compensation expense.
marketing and selling marketing and selling expenses for the periods indicated were as follows:
change marketing and selling      $429              $428              $423          $1                      $5
marketing and selling expenses remained relatively flat in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 due to continued cost management efforts. marketing and selling expenses for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014 included $26 million, $26 million and $23 million, respectively, of share-based compensation expense.
change general and administrative (g&a) expenses for fiscal 2016 decreased compared to the prior year. g&a expenses were higher in fiscal 2015 primarily due to acquisition-related and integration costs related to the terminated business combination with tokyo electron limited (tel), impact of foreign currency exchange loss as a result of functional currency correction, and restructuring charges, all recorded during fiscal 2015.
g&a expenses for fiscal 2015 decreased compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to lower acquisition-related and integration costs related to the terminated business combination with tel, which was terminated in april 2015, and continued cost management efforts. g&a expenses during fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 included $37 million, $35 million and $35 million, respectively, of share-based compensation expense.
loss (gain) on derivatives associated with terminated business combination change loss (gain) on derivatives associated with terminated business combination   $-              $(89      )       $(30      )      $89                     $(59          )
changes in gain or loss on derivatives associated with the terminated business combination with tel resulted from exchange rate fluctuations and the sale of derivative contracts in fiscal 2015. for further details, see note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
change interest expenses incurred were primarily associated with the senior unsecured notes issued in june 2011 and september 2015. interest expense for fiscal 2016 increased compared to fiscal 2015 due to the issuance of senior unsecured notes in september 2015.
interest and other income, net primarily includes interest earned on cash and investments, realized gains or losses on sales of securities and impairment of strategic investments. interest and other income, net in fiscal 2016 increased compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher interest income from investments, partially offset by a $5 million loss from prepayment of $400 million debt. interest and other income, net in fiscal 2015 decreased compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to lower realized gains on sales of strategic investments in fiscal 2015.
change effective income tax rate       14.5   %          13.8   %          26.0   %               0.7 points       (12.2) points applied's provision for income taxes and effective tax rate are affected by the geographical composition of pre-tax income which includes jurisdictions with differing tax rates, conditional reduced tax rates and other income tax incentives. it is also affected by events that are not consistent from period to period, such as changes in income tax laws and the resolution of prior years' income tax filings.
applied's effective tax rates for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 were 14.5%, 13.8% and 26.0%, respectively. the effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was higher than fiscal 2015 primarily due to resolutions and changes related to income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions, partially offset by changes in the geographical composition of income.
the effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was lower than the rate for fiscal 2014 primarily due to acquisition costs that became deductible in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 as a result of the termination of the proposed business combination with tel, an adjustment in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 to correct an error in the recognition of cost of sales in the u.s. related to intercompany sales as discussed below, reinstatement of the u.s. federal research and development tax credit during the first quarter of fiscal 2015 which was retroactive to its expiration in december 2013, resolutions and changes related to income tax liabilities for prior years, and changes in the geographical composition of income.
the effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 included the effect of an adjustment primarily to correct an error in the recognition of cost of sales in the u.s. related to intercompany sales. while this error had no impact on applied's consolidated cost of sales, it resulted in overstating profitability in the u.s. and the provision for income taxes, income taxes payable and other tax balance sheet accounts in each year since fiscal 2010. the impact of the adjustment to fiscal 2015 was a decrease in provision for income taxes of $28 million which was determined to be immaterial on the originating periods and fiscal 2015. accordingly, a restatement was not considered necessary.
segment information applied reports financial results in three segments: semiconductor systems, applied global services, and display and adjacent markets. a description of the products and services, as well as financial data, for each reportable segment can be found in note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements.
the corporate and other category includes revenues from products, as well as costs of products sold, for fabricating solar photovoltaic cells and modules and certain operating expenses that are not allocated to its reportable segments and are managed separately at the corporate level. these operating expenses include costs for share-based compensation; certain management, finance, legal, human resource, and rd&e functions provided at the corporate level; and unabsorbed information technology and occupancy. in addition, applied does not allocate to its reportable segments restructuring and asset impairment charges and any associated adjustments related to restructuring actions, unless these actions pertain to a specific reportable segment.
semiconductor systems segment the semiconductor systems segment includes semiconductor capital equipment for deposition, etch, ion implantation, rapid thermal processing, chemical mechanical planarization, metrology and inspection, and wafer level packaging. development efforts are focused on solving customers' key technical challenges in transistor, interconnect, patterning and packaging performance as devices scale to advanced technology nodes. the mobility trend remains the largest influence on industry spending, as it drives semiconductor device manufacturers to continually improve their ability to deliver high-performance, low-power processors and affordable memories.

new orders for semiconductor systems by end use application for the periods indicated were as follows:
the following region accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the semiconductor systems segment for one or more of past three fiscal years:
change customers in taiwan accounted for 32 percent, 32 percent and 37 percent of total net sales for semiconductor systems in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the increase in net sales from customers in taiwan primarily reflected increased investments from foundry customers.
financial results in the semiconductor systems segment for fiscal 2016 reflected steady overall demand for semiconductor equipment, with continued investments by memory customers in technology upgrades and additional capacity, reflecting primarily the transition from planar technology to 3d architectures. foundry customers also invested in technology upgrades and new capacity to meet demand for advanced mobile chips. new orders for fiscal 2016 increased compared to the prior year primarily due to higher demand from foundry customers, partially offset by lower demand from memory customers. net sales for fiscal 2016 increased compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher spending from foundry and memory customers. the increase in the operating income, non-gaap adjusted operating income, operating margin and non-gaap adjusted operating margin for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily reflected higher net sales. three customers accounted for approximately 54 percent of this segment's new orders for fiscal 2016, each of whom represented at least 10 percent of this segment's new orders. four customers accounted for approximately 60 percent of this segment's net sales for fiscal 2016, each of whom represented at least 10 percent of this segment's net sales.
the increase in new orders and net sales in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily reflected increased demand and spending from memory customers, partially offset by lower demand and spending from foundry customers. two customers accounted for approximately 41 percent of net sales and three customers accounted for 53 percent of new orders in this segment in fiscal 2015. operating income and non-gaap adjusted operating income for fiscal 2015 increased compared to fiscal 2014, reflecting the increase in net sales, partially offset by changes in product mix and higher research and development expenses.
applied global services segment the applied global services segment provides integrated solutions to optimize equipment and fab performance and productivity, including spares, upgrades, services, certain remanufactured earlier generation equipment and factory automation software for semiconductor, display and other products. customer demand for products and services is fulfilled through a global distribution system with trained service engineers located in close proximity to customer sites.
certain significant measures for the periods indicated were as follows:

there was no single region that accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the applied global services segment for any of the past three fiscal years.
new orders and net sales for fiscal 2016 slightly increased compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher demand and spending on spares and services, partially offset by lower investments in 200mm equipment systems. operating income, non-gaap adjusted operating income, operating margin and non-gaap adjusted operating margin for fiscal 2016 increased compared to fiscal 2015, reflecting higher net sales partially offset by increased headcount to support business growth. one customer accounted for approximately 15 percent of this segment's new orders for fiscal 2016. two customers accounted for approximately 23 percent of this segment's net sales for fiscal 2016, each of whom represented at least 10 percent of this segment's net sales.
new orders and net sales for fiscal 2015 increased compared to fiscal 2014 mainly due to higher demand for semiconductor spares and services, and 200mm equipment systems. operating income, operating margin, non-gaap adjusted operating income, and non-gaap adjusted operating margin increased in fiscal 2015 compared fiscal 2014, reflecting the increase in net sales, which was partially offset by unfavorable product mix and the absence of a recovery of a regional customs duty assessment charge recorded in fiscal 2014.
display and adjacent markets segment the display and adjacent markets segment encompasses products for manufacturing liquid crystal displays (lcds), organic light-emitting diodes (oleds), upgrades and flexible coating systems and other display technologies for tvs, personal computers (pcs), tablets, smart phones and other consumer-oriented devices. the segment is focused on expanding its presence through technologically-differentiated equipment for manufacturing large-scale tvs; emerging markets such as oled, low temperature polysilicon (ltps), metal oxide, and touch panel sectors; and development of products that provide customers with improved performance and yields. display and adjacent markets industry growth depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced tvs as well as larger and higher resolution displays for next generation mobile devices, including oled.

the following regions accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the display and adjacent markets segment for one or more of the periods presented:
change in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, customers in china accounted for 37 percent, 66 percent and 69 percent, respectively, of the display and adjacent markets segment's total net sales. customers in korea accounted for 41 percent, 17 percent and 17 percent of total net sales for the display and adjacent markets segment in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the decrease in net sales from customers in china reflected lower customer investments in tv manufacturing equipment, while the increase in net sales from customers in korea related to investments in mobile display manufacturing equipment.
new orders for fiscal 2016 increased compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to increased orders for mobile display manufacturing equipment, reflecting increased demand for new technology, and tv manufacturing equipment. net sales for fiscal 2016 increased compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher customer investments in mobile display manufacturing equipment, partially offset by lower customer spending in tv manufacturing equipment. operating income and non-gaap adjusted operating income increased while operating margin and non-gaap adjusted operating margin remained essentially flat or decreased slightly for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, reflecting unfavorable product mix and higher research and new product development costs. two customers accounted for approximately 63 percent of new orders for the display and adjacent markets segment in fiscal 2016, with one customer accounting for approximately 36 percent of new orders. two customers accounted for approximately 55 percent of net sales for this segment in fiscal 2016, with one customer accounting for approximately 44 percent of net sales.
new orders for fiscal 2015 decreased compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to lower tv manufacturing equipment orders, while net sales for fiscal 2015 were higher due to the timing of shipments. operating income and non-gaap adjusted operating income increased for fiscal 2015 from fiscal 2014, reflecting higher net sales. operating margin and non-gaap adjusted operating margin decreased, despite the increase in net sales, primarily due to unfavorable product mix, increased research and development expenses and the sale of tools in fiscal 2014 for which inventory had been previously fully reserved. four customers accounted for approximately 65 percent of new orders for the display and adjacent markets segment in fiscal 2015, with two customers accounting for approximately 37 percent of new orders. four customers accounted for approximately 79 percent of net sales for this segment in fiscal 2015, with two customers accounting for approximately 46 percent of net sales.
recent accounting pronouncements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, if any, on applied's consolidated financial statements, see note 1, "summary of significant accounting policies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
financial condition, liquidity and capital resources applied's cash, cash equivalents and investments consist of the following:
sources and uses of cash a summary of cash provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities is as follows:
cash provided by operating activities             $2,466                 $1,163           $1,800
operating activities cash from operating activities for fiscal 2016 was $2.5 billion, which reflects net income adjusted for the effect of non-cash charges and changes in working capital components. non-cash charges included depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation and deferred income taxes. the primary drivers of the increase in cash from operating activities from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 included higher net income and increases in customer deposits, deferred revenue, accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially offset by higher increases in accounts receivable. the primary drivers of the decrease in cash from operating activities from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015 were the increases in inventories and deferred income taxes and decreases in accounts payable, accrued expenses, customer deposits, deferred revenue and income taxes payable, partially offset by higher net income.
applied has agreements with various financial institutions to sell accounts receivable and discount promissory notes from selected customers. applied sells its accounts receivable without recourse. applied, from time to time, also discounts letters of credit issued by customers through various financial institutions. the discounting of letters of credit depends on many factors, including the willingness of financial institutions to discount the letters of credit and the cost of such arrangements. applied sold $75 million and $45 million of accounts receivable during fiscal 2016 and 2014, respectively. applied did not sell accounts receivable during fiscal 2015. applied did not discount promissory notes or utilize programs to discount letters of credit issued by customers during fiscal 2016 or 2015. applied discounted $29 million letters of credit issued by customers during fiscal 2014.
applied's working capital was $4.7 billion at october 30, 2016 and $5.5 billion at october 25, 2015. applied's working capital at october 30, 2016 includes the effects of the adoption of the authoritative guidance requiring all deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any related valuation allowance, to be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted.
days sales, inventory and payable outstanding at the end of each of the periods indicated were:
days sales outstanding varies due to the timing of shipments and payment terms. days sales outstanding decreased at the end of fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher revenue and sale of accounts receivable, and remained flat at the end of fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. the decrease in days inventory outstanding during the current year compared to prior year reflected increased business volume, offset by higher inventory balances at the end of fiscal 2016. days inventory outstanding increased at the end of fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 reflecting higher inventory near the end of the period due to increase in deferred inventory and more builds as compared to revenue turns. days payable outstanding decreased slightly during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 reflecting higher total cost of products sold due to higher business volume, and remained relatively flat in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014.
investing activities applied used $425 million, $281 million, and $161 million of cash in investing activities in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. capital expenditures in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $253 million, $215 million and $241 million, respectively. capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 and 2015 were primarily for demonstration and test equipment and laboratory tools in north america. capital expenditures in fiscal 2014 were primarily for demonstration and test equipment and infrastructure improvements in north america, including creation of a new pilot operation facility and distribution center. purchases of investments, net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments was $156 million and $62 million for fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, net of purchases of investments totaled $67 million in fiscal 2014. investing activities also included investments in technology to allow applied to access new market opportunities or emerging technologies.
applied's investment portfolio consists principally of investment grade money market mutual funds, u.s. treasury and agency securities, municipal bonds, corporate bonds and mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, as well as equity securities. applied regularly monitors the credit risk in its investment portfolio and takes appropriate measures, which may include the sale of certain securities, to manage such risks prudently in accordance with its investment policies.
financing activities applied used $3.4 billion of cash in financing activities in fiscal 2016, consisting primarily of $1.2 billion in debt repayments, $1.9 billion in repurchases of its common stock, and $444 million in cash dividends to stockholders, offset by excess tax benefits from share-based compensation of $23 million and proceeds from common stock issuances of $88 million.
applied generated $913 million of cash from financing activities in fiscal 2015, consisting primarily of net proceeds received from the issuance of senior unsecured notes of $1.8 billion and short-term borrowings of $800 million, offset by cash used for repurchases of its common stock of $1.3 billion and payment of cash dividends of $487 million. applied used $348 million of cash in financing activities in fiscal 2014, which included payment of cash dividends to stockholders and issuances of common stock. applied made no repurchases of its common stock in fiscal 2014. on june 9, 2016, applied's board of directors approved a new common stock repurchase program authorizing up to $2.0 billion in repurchases which followed the completion of a $3.0 billion common stock repurchase program approved on april 26, 2015. at october 30, 2016, $1.8 billion remained available for future stock repurchases under this repurchase program. proceeds from stock issuances under equity compensation awards and related excess tax benefits in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $111 million, $144 million and $137 million, respectively.
during each of fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, applied's board of directors declared quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.10 per share. applied currently anticipates that cash dividends will continue to be paid on a quarterly basis, although the declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on applied's financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as a determination by the board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interests of applied's stockholders.
applied has credit facilities for unsecured borrowings in various currencies of up to $1.6 billion, of which $1.5 billion is comprised of a committed revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that is scheduled to expire in september 2020. this agreement provides for borrowings in united states dollars at interest rates keyed to one of two rates selected by applied for each advance and includes financial and other covenants with which applied was in compliance at october 30, 2016. remaining credit facilities in the amount of approximately $77 million are with japanese banks. applied's ability to borrow under these facilities is subject to bank approval at the time of the borrowing request, and any advances will be at rates indexed to the banks' prime reference rate denominated in japanese yen. no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities at both october 30, 2016 and october 25, 2015, and applied has not utilized these credit facilities.
in fiscal 2011, applied established a short-term commercial paper program of up to $1.5 billion. at october 30, 2016 and october 25, 2015, applied did not have any commercial paper outstanding, but may issue commercial paper notes under this program from time to time in the future.
applied had senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $3.4 billion outstanding as of october 30, 2016. the indentures governing these notes include covenants with which applied was in compliance at october 30, 2016. in november 2015, applied completed the redemption of the entire outstanding $400 million in principal amount of senior notes due in 2016. the redemption price was $405 million, and after adjusting for the carrying value of the debt issuance costs and discounts, applied recorded a $5 million loss on the prepayment of the $400 million debt, which is included in non-operating loss in the consolidated statement of operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. see note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of existing debt. applied may seek to refinance its existing debt and may incur additional indebtedness depending on applied's capital requirements and the availability of financing.
others during fiscal 2016, applied recorded a bad debt provision of $3 million, and released $9 million and $16 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively, of its allowance for doubtful accounts as a result of an overall lower risk profile of applied's customers. while applied believes that its allowance for doubtful accounts at october 30, 2016 is adequate, it will continue to closely monitor customer liquidity and economic conditions.
as of october 30, 2016, approximately $4.0 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries may be subject to u.s. income taxes if repatriated for u.s. operations. applied intends to indefinitely reinvest approximately $3.3 billion of these funds outside of the u.s. and does not plan to repatriate these funds. applied would need to accrue and pay u.s. taxes if these funds were repatriated. for the remaining cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries, u.s. income taxes have been provided for in the financial statements. subsequent to october 30, 2016, a foreign subsidiary of applied made an advance payment of $1.8 billion to applied. applied's provision for income taxes and effective tax rate will not be materially affected by this transaction.
although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of factors such as those discussed above, applied's management believes that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability, will be sufficient to satisfy applied's liquidity requirements for the next 12 months. for further details regarding applied's operating, investing and financing activities, see the consolidated statements of cash flows in this report.
for details on standby letters of credit and other agreements with banks, see off-balance sheet arrangements below.
off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either applied or its subsidiaries. as of october 30, 2016, the maximum potential amount of future payments that applied could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was approximately $52 million. applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee agreements beyond that required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed. applied does not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee agreements.
applied also has agreements with various banks to facilitate subsidiary banking operations worldwide, including overdraft arrangements, issuance of bank guarantees, and letters of credit. as of october 30, 2016, applied materials inc. has provided parent guarantees to banks for approximately $100 million to cover these arrangements.
applied also has operating leases for various facilities. total rent expense for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $38 million, $32 million and $37 million, respectively.
contractual obligations the following table summarizes applied's contractual obligations as of october 30, 2016:
operating lease obligations                                66                      26                    27                    7                        6
1   represents applied's agreements to purchase goods and services consisting of applied's outstanding purchase orders for goods and services.
2   other long-term liabilities in the table do not include pension, post-retirement and deferred compensation plans due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments. applied evaluates the need to make contributions to its pension and post-retirement benefit plans after considering the funded status of the plans, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. payments to the plans would be dependent on these factors and could vary across a wide range of amounts and time periods. payments for deferred compensation plans are dependent on activity by participants, making the timing of payments uncertain. information on applied's pension, post-retirement benefit and deferred compensation plans is presented in note 11, employee benefit plans, of the consolidated financial statements.
3   applied's other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets include deferred tax liabilities, gross unrecognized tax benefits and related gross interest and penalties. as of october 30, 2016, the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits that was not expected to result in payment of cash within one year was $320 million. interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions that were not expected to result in payment of cash within one year of october 30, 2016 and october 25, 2015 were $33 million and $14 million, respectively. at this time, applied is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table.
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. note 1 of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies.
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of applied's consolidated financial statements and that requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on applied's financial condition or results of operations. specifically, these policies have the following attributes: (1) applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate; and (2) different estimates applied could reasonably have used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, would have a material effect on applied's financial condition or results of operations.
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances. these estimates may change as new events occur, as additional information is obtained and as applied's operating environment changes. these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known. in addition, management is periodically faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time. these uncertainties include those discussed in part i, item 1a, "risk factors." based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies, management believes that applied's consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america, and provide a meaningful presentation of applied's financial condition and results of operations.
management believes that the following are critical accounting policies and estimates:
revenue recognition applied recognizes revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is probable. each sale arrangement may contain commercial terms that differ from other arrangements. in addition, applied frequently enters into contracts that contain multiple deliverables. judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units. moreover, judgment is used in interpreting the commercial terms and determining when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period. while changes in the allocation of the estimated sales price between the units of accounting will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular sales arrangement, any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition, which could have a material effect on applied's financial condition and results of operations.
warranty costs applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized. estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product, current and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs. applied's warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates, material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period. as applied's customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally, labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs. the quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs. unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs. if actual warranty costs differ substantially from applied's estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required, which could have a material adverse effect on applied's business, financial condition and results of operations.
allowance for doubtful accounts applied maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. this allowance is based on historical experience, credit evaluations, specific customer collection history and any customer-specific issues applied has identified. changes in circumstances, such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer's ability to meet its financial obligation to applied or its payment trends, may require applied to further adjust its estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to applied, which could have a material adverse effect on applied's business, financial condition and results of operations.
inventory valuation inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand. applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand. in addition, inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products. if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated, additional adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required, which could have a material adverse effect on applied's business, financial condition and results of operations.
goodwill and intangible assets applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable, and also annually reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives for impairment. intangible assets, such as purchased technology, are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition. the value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates, applied may be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value.
to test goodwill for impairment, applied first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. if it is concluded that this is the case, applied then performs the two-step goodwill impairment test. otherwise, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. under the two-step goodwill impairment test, applied would in the first step compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, applied would then perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. if applied determines that the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, applied would record an impairment charge equal to the difference.
applied determines the fair value of each reporting unit based on a weighting of an income and a market approach. applied bases the fair value estimates on assumptions that it believes to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. under the income approach, applied estimates the fair value based on discounted cash flow method.
the estimates used in the impairment testing are consistent with the discrete forecasts that applied uses to manage its business, and considers any significant developments during the period. under the discounted cash flow method, cash flows beyond the discrete forecasts are estimated using a terminal growth rate, which considers the long-term earnings growth rate specific to the reporting units. the estimated future cash flows are discounted to present value using each reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital. the weighted average cost of capital measures a reporting unit's cost of debt and equity financing weighted by the percentage of debt and equity in a reporting unit's target capital structure. in addition, the weighted average cost of capital is derived using both known and estimated market metrics, and is adjusted to reflect both the timing and risks associated with the estimated cash flows. the tax rate used in the discounted cash flow method is the median tax rate of comparable companies and reflects applied's current international structure, which is consistent with the market participant perspective. under the market approach, applied uses the guideline company method which applies market multiples to forecasted revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. applied uses market multiples that are consistent with comparable publicly-traded companies and considers each reporting unit's size, growth and profitability relative to its comparable companies.
management uses significant judgment when assessing goodwill for potential impairment, especially in emerging markets. indicators of potential impairment include, but are not limited to, challenging economic conditions, an unfavorable industry or economic environment or other severe decline in market conditions. such conditions could have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates used for the fair value calculation, resulting in an unexpected goodwill impairment charge, which could have a material adverse effect on applied's business, financial condition and results of operations. see note 8 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of goodwill impairment.
income taxes applied's provision for income taxes and effective tax rate are affected by the geographical composition of pre-tax income which includes jurisdictions with differing tax rates, conditional reduced tax rates and other income tax incentives. it is also affected by events that are not consistent from period to period, such as changes to income tax laws and the resolution of prior years' income tax filings.
applied recognizes a current tax liability for the estimated amount of income tax payable on tax returns for the current fiscal year. deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. deferred tax assets are also recognized for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. deferred tax assets are offset by a valuation allowance to the extent it is more likely than not that they are not expected to be realized.
applied recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized from such positions are estimated based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. any changes in judgment related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the quarter in which such change occurs. interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in applied's provision for income taxes.
the calculation of applied's provision for income taxes and effective tax rate involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with applied's expectations could have an adverse material impact on applied's results of operations and financial condition.
non-gaap adjusted financial results applied provides investors with certain non-gaap adjusted financial measures, which are adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs, expenses, gains and losses, including certain items related to mergers and acquisitions; restructuring charges and any associated adjustments; impairments of assets, or investments; gain or loss on sale of strategic investments; certain other discrete adjustments and income tax items. reconciliations of these non-gaap measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap are provided in the financial tables presented below.
management uses these non-gaap adjusted financial measures to evaluate the company's operating and financial performance and for planning purposes, and as performance measures in its executive compensation program. applied believes these measures enhance an overall understanding of our performance and investors' ability to review the company's business from the same perspective as the company's management and facilitate comparisons of this period's results with prior periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operating performance. there are limitations in using non-gaap financial measures because the non-gaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, may be different from non-gaap financial measures used by other companies, and may exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. the presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap.

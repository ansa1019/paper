item 1a. risk factors in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this form 10-k, the following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of us.
we have experienced dramatic declines in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products which have adversely affected our business.
if average selling prices for our memory products decrease faster than we can decrease per gigabit costs, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. we have experienced significant decreases in our average selling prices per gigabit in recent years as noted in the table below and may continue to experience such decreases in the future. in some prior periods, average selling prices for our memory products have been below our manufacturing costs and we may experience such circumstances in the future.
(percentage change in average selling prices)
our gross margins are dependent upon continuing decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes, including reducing the die size of our existing products. in future periods, we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to maintain or improve gross margins. factors that may limit our ability to reduce costs include, but are not limited to, strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix, the increasing complexity of manufacturing processes, difficulty in transitioning to smaller line-width process technologies, technological barriers and changes in process technologies or products that may require relatively larger die sizes. per gigabit manufacturing costs may also be affected by the relatively smaller production quantities and shorter product lifecycles of certain specialty memory products.
the semiconductor memory industry is highly competitive.
we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies, including samsung electronics co., ltd.; sandisk corporation; sk hynix inc. and toshiba corporation. some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete, invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities. consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage. in addition, some governments, such as china, may be considering providing, or have provided, significant financial assistance to some of our competitors or to new entrants. our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity, improve yields, reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs. transitions to smaller line-width process technologies and product and process improvements have resulted in significant increases in the worldwide supply of semiconductor memory. increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory also result from semiconductor memory fab capacity expansions, either by way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory production. our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply. increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory, if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand, would lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
our inotera supply agreement involves numerous risks.
we have a supply agreement with inotera (the "inotera supply agreement") under which we are obligated to purchase substantially all of inotera's dram output over an initial three-year term at a purchase price based on a discount from market prices for our comparable components, currently through december 2016. the inotera supply agreement contemplates annual negotiations with respect to potential successive one-year extensions, and if the parties do not agree to an extension, the agreement will terminate following the end of the then-existing term plus a subsequent three-year wind-down period. in the event of a wind-down, our share of inotera's capacity would decline over the wind-down period. we are currently in negotiations regarding the extension of the inotera supply agreement. there can be no assurance that we will be able to reach an agreement. our inotera supply agreement involves numerous additional risks including the following:
•   higher costs for supply obtained under the inotera supply agreement as compared to our wholly-owned facilities;
•   difficulties in coming to an agreement with nanya regarding major corporate decisions, such as capital expenditures or capital structure.
for 2014, we purchased $2.68 billion of dram products from inotera and our supply from inotera accounted for 38% of our aggregate dram gigabit production. if our supply of dram from inotera is impacted, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
debt obligations could adversely affect our financial condition.
we are engaged in a capital intensive business subject to significant changes in supply and demand and product pricing and recent periods of consolidation, any of which could result in our incurrence or assumption of indebtedness. in recent periods, our debt levels have increased. as of august 28, 2014, we had debt with a carrying value of $6.59 billion. in addition, the conversion value in excess of principal amount for our convertible notes outstanding as of august 28, 2014 was $2.99 billion. in 2014, we paid $2.30 billion to repurchase and settle conversion obligations for convertible notes with a principal amount of $1.09 billion. in the first quarter of 2015, we paid $389 million to settle conversion obligations for convertible notes with a principal amount of $114 million as of august 28, 2014. as of august 28, 2014, we had two credit facilities available that provide for up to $408 million of additional financing, subject to outstanding balances of trade receivables and other conditions. events and circumstances may occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy the applicable drawdown conditions and utilize either of these facilities. we have in the past and expect in the future to continue to incur additional debt to finance our capital investments, including debt incurred in connection with asset-backed financing.
our debt obligations could adversely impact us. for example, these obligations could:
•   require us to use a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on debt, which will reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development expenditures and other business activities;
•   continue to dilute our earnings per share as a result of the conversion provisions in our convertible notes;
•   require us to continue to pay cash amounts substantially in excess of the principal amounts upon settlement of our convertible notes to minimize dilution of our earnings per share;
•   limit our future ability to raise funds for capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities, research and development and other general corporate requirements;
•   contribute to a future downgrade of our credit rating, which could increase future borrowing costs; and
•   increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and semiconductor memory industry conditions.
our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future. this, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. there can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that additional capital will be available to us, in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs. if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. if we were unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may be unable to meet our debt payment obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations, make scheduled debt payments and make adequate capital investments.
our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory sold, average selling prices and per unit manufacturing costs. to develop new product and process technologies, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality, we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology, capital equipment, facilities, r&d and product and process technology. we estimate that capital spending for 2015 will be approximately $3.6 billion to $4.0 billion. in addition, as a result of the mmj acquisition, we believe that our future capital spending will be higher than our historical levels as we integrate our manufacturing operations and support the increase of capacity resulting from the transaction. as of august 28, 2014, we had cash and equivalents of $4.15 billion, short-term investments of $384 million and long-term marketable investments of $819 million. cash and investments included $1.60 billion held by mmj and its consolidated subsidiaries and $84 million held by imft, none of which is generally available to finance our other operations.
as a result of the corporate reorganization proceedings with the japan court under the corporate reorganization act of japan (the "japan proceedings"), for so long as such proceedings are continuing, the mmj companies and their subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions on dividends, loans and advances. the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies prohibit the mmj companies from paying dividends, including any cash dividends, to us and require that excess earnings be used in their businesses or to fund the mmj companies' installment payments. these prohibitions would also effectively prevent the subsidiaries of the mmj companies from paying cash dividends to us in respect of the shares of such subsidiaries owned by the mmj companies, as any such dividends would have to be first paid to the mmj companies which are prohibited from repaying those amounts to us as dividends under the plans of reorganization. in addition, pursuant to an order of the japan court, the mmj companies cannot make loans or advances, other than certain ordinary course advances, to us without the consent of the japan court. moreover, loans or advances by subsidiaries of the mmj companies may be considered outside of the ordinary course of business and subject to approval of the legal trustees and japan court. as a result, the assets of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries, while available to satisfy the mmj companies' installment payments and the other obligations, capital expenditures and other operating needs of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries, are not available for use by us in our other operations. furthermore, certain uses of the assets of the mmj companies, including investments in certain capital expenditures in mmt, may require consent of mmj's trustees and/or the japan court.
in the past we have utilized external sources of financing when needed. as a result of our current debt levels, expected debt amortization and general economic conditions, it may be difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us. there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows, use cash held by mmj to fund its capital expenditures, access capital markets or find other sources of financing to fund our operations, make debt amortization payments and make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency. our inability to do the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
the acquisition of our ownership interest in inotera from qimonda has been challenged by the administrator of the insolvency proceedings for qimonda.
on january 20, 2011, dr. michael jaffé, administrator for qimonda insolvency proceedings, filed suit against mti and micron semiconductor b.v., our netherlands subsidiary ("micron b.v."), in the district court of munich, civil chamber. the complaint seeks to void under section 133 of the german insolvency act a share purchase agreement between micron b.v. and qimonda signed in fall 2008 pursuant to which micron b.v. purchased substantially all of qimonda's shares of inotera memories, inc. (the "inotera shares"), representing approximately 55% of our total shares in inotera, and seeks an order requiring us to retransfer those shares to the qimonda estate. the complaint also seeks, among other things, to recover damages for the alleged value of the joint venture relationship with inotera and to terminate under sections 103 or 133 of the german insolvency code a patent cross-license between us and qimonda entered into at the same time as the share purchase agreement.
following a series of hearings with pleadings, arguments and witnesses on behalf of the qimonda estate, on march 13, 2014, the court issued judgments:  (1) ordering micron b.v. to pay approximately $1 million in respect of certain inotera shares sold in connection with the original share purchase; (2) ordering micron b.v. to disclose certain information with respect to any inotera shares sold by it to third parties; (3) ordering micron b.v. to disclose the benefits derived by it from ownership of the inotera shares, including in particular, any profits distributed on such shares and all other benefits; (4) denying qimonda's claims against micron technology for any damages relating to the joint venture relationship with inotera; and (5) determining that qimonda's obligations under the patent cross-license agreement are cancelled. in addition, the court issued interlocutory judgments ordering, among other things:  (1) that micron b.v. transfer to the qimonda estate the inotera shares still owned by it and pay to the qimonda estate compensation in an amount to be specified for any inotera shares sold to third parties; and (2) that micron b.v. pay the qimonda estate as compensation an amount to be specified for benefits derived by it from ownership of the inotera shares. the interlocutory judgments have no immediate, enforceable effect on us, and, accordingly, we expect to be able to continue to operate with full control of the inotera shares subject to further developments in the case. we have filed a notice of appeal, and the parties have submitted briefs to the appeals court. a hearing on the matter is scheduled for february 2, 2015.
we are unable to predict the outcome of the matter and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss. the final resolution of this lawsuit could result in the loss of the inotera shares or equivalent monetary damages, unspecified damages based on the benefits derived by micron b.v. from the ownership of the inotera shares, and/or the termination of the patent cross-license, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation or financial condition.  as of august 28, 2014, the inotera shares had a carrying value for purposes of our financial reporting of $505 million and a market value of $2.06 billion.
our future success depends on our ability to develop and produce competitive new memory technologies.
our key semiconductor memory technologies of dram, nand flash and nor flash face technological barriers to continue to meet long-term customer needs. these barriers include potential limitations on the ability to shrink products in order to reduce costs, meet higher density requirements and improve power consumption and reliability. to meet these requirements, we expect that new memory technologies will be developed by the semiconductor memory industry. our competitors are working to develop new memory technologies that may offer performance and/or cost advantages to our existing memory technologies and render existing technologies obsolete. accordingly, our future success may depend on our ability to develop and produce viable and competitive new memory technologies. there can be no assurance of the following:
•   that we will be successful in developing competitive new semiconductor memory technologies;
•   that we will be able to successfully market these technologies; and
•   that margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts.
if our efforts to develop new semiconductor memory technologies are unsuccessful, our business, results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected.
new product development may be unsuccessful.
we are developing new products that complement our traditional memory products or leverage their underlying design or process technology. we have made significant investments in product and process technologies and anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product development, including system-level memory products, over the next several years. the process to develop dram, nand flash, nor flash and certain specialty memory products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality and performance, many times well in advance of a planned ramp of production, in order to secure design wins with our customers. there can be no assurance that our product development efforts will be successful, that we will be able to cost-effectively manufacture new products, that we will be able to successfully market these products or that margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts.
products that do not meet specifications or that contain, or are perceived by our customers to contain, defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. from time to time we experience problems with nonconforming, defective or incompatible products after we have shipped such products. in recent periods we have further diversified and expanded our product offerings which could potentially increase the chance that one or more of our products could fail to meet specifications in a particular application. as a result of these problems we could be adversely affected in several ways, including the following:
•   we may be required to compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or incompatible product or replace products;
•   we could incur a decrease in revenue or adjustment to pricing commensurate with the reimbursement of such costs or alleged damages; and
•   we may encounter adverse publicity, which could cause a decrease in sales of our products.
a determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others or entering into a license agreement covering such intellectual property could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
as is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries, from time to time others have asserted, and may in the future assert, that our products or manufacturing processes infringe their intellectual property rights. we are unable to predict the outcome of assertions of infringement made against us. a court determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could result in significant liability and/or require us to make material changes to our products and/or manufacturing processes. any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. (see "item 1. legal proceedings.")
we have a number of intellectual property license agreements. some of these license agreements require us to make one time or periodic payments. we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future. we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms.
our joint ventures and strategic relationships involve numerous risks.
we have entered into strategic relationships to manufacture products and develop new manufacturing process technologies and products. these relationships include our imft nand flash joint venture with intel, our inotera dram joint venture with nanya and our mp mask joint venture with photronics. these joint ventures and strategic relationships are subject to various risks that could adversely affect the value of our investments and our results of operations. these risks include the following:
•   our interests could diverge from our partners or we may not be able to agree with partners on ongoing manufacturing and operational activities, or on the amount, timing or nature of further investments in our joint venture;
•   we may experience difficulties in transferring technology to joint ventures;
•   we may experience difficulties and delays in ramping production at joint ventures;
•   our control over the operations of our joint ventures is limited;
•   we may recognize losses from our equity method investments in future periods;
•   due to financial constraints, our joint venture partners may be unable to meet their commitments to us or our joint ventures and may pose credit risks for our transactions with them;
•   due to differing business models or long-term business goals, our partners may decide not to join us in funding capital investment by our joint ventures, which may result in higher levels of cash expenditures by us;
•   cash flows may be inadequate to fund increased capital requirements;
•   we may experience difficulties or delays in collecting amounts due to us from our joint ventures and partners;
•   the terms of our partnering arrangements may turn out to be unfavorable; and
•   changes in tax, legal or regulatory requirements may necessitate changes in the agreements with our partners.
if our joint ventures and strategic relationships are unsuccessful, our business, results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected.
the operations of the mmj companies will be subject to continued oversight by the japan court during the pendency of the corporate reorganization proceedings.
because the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies provide for ongoing payments to creditors following the closing of our acquisition of mmj, the japan proceedings are continuing, and the mmj companies remain subject to the oversight of the japan court and of the trustees (including a trustee designated by us, who we refer to as the business trustee, and a trustee designated by the japan court, who we refer to as the legal trustee), pending completion of the japan proceedings. the japan proceedings and oversight of the japan court are expected to continue until the final creditor payment is made under the mmj companies' plans of reorganization, which is scheduled to occur in december 2019, but may occur on a later date to the extent any claims of creditors remain unfixed on the final scheduled installment payment date. although we may be able to petition the court to terminate the japan proceedings once two-thirds of all payments under the plans of reorganization are made, there can be no assurance that the japan court will grant any such petition.
during the pendency of the japan proceedings, the mmj companies are obligated to provide periodic financial reports to the japan court and may be required to obtain the consent of the japan court prior to taking a number of significant actions relating to their businesses, including transferring or disposing of, or acquiring, certain material assets, incurring or guaranteeing material indebtedness, settling disputes or entering into certain material agreements. the consent of the legal trustee may also be required for matters that would likely have a material impact on the operations or assets of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries or for transfers of material assets, to the extent the matters or transfers would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect execution of the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies. accordingly, during the pendency of the japan proceedings, our ability to effectively integrate the mmj companies as part of our global operations or to cause the mmj companies to take certain actions that we deem advisable for their businesses could be adversely affected if the japan court or the legal trustee is unwilling to consent to various actions that we may wish to take with respect to the mmj companies.
if our manufacturing process is disrupted, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
we manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance. difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs. we maintain operations and continuously implement new product and process technology at our manufacturing operations which are widely dispersed in multiple locations in several countries including the u.s., singapore, taiwan, japan and china. additionally, our control over operations at our imft, inotera, mp mask and tera probe joint ventures is limited by our agreements with our partners. from time to time, we have experienced disruptions in our manufacturing process as a result of power outages, improperly functioning equipment, equipment failures, earthquakes or other environmental acts. if production at a fabrication facility is disrupted for any reason, manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers' requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers. this could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs or loss of revenues or damage to customer relationships, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
we may incur additional restructure or other charges in future periods.
in recent periods, we have implemented restructure activities and may implement restructure initiatives in future periods. as a result, we could incur restructure charges (including but not limited to severance and other termination benefits, losses on disposition or impairment of equipment or other long-lived assets and inventory write downs), lose production output, lose key personnel and experience disruptions in our operations and difficulties in the timely delivery of products. in connection with these actions, we recorded charges of $40 million for 2014 and $126 million for 2013. we do not anticipate incurring any significant additional costs for these prior restructure activities. we may incur additional restructure charges or other losses associated with other initiatives in future periods.
changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
across our multi-national operations, there are transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar (our reporting currency), primarily the euro, the singapore dollar, the new taiwan dollar, the yen and the yuan. we recorded net losses from changes in currency exchange rates of $28 million for 2014 and $229 million for 2013. based on our foreign currency exposures from monetary assets and liabilities, offset by balance sheet hedges, we estimate that a 10% adverse change in exchange rates versus the u.s. dollar would result in losses of approximately $7 million as of august 28, 2014. in addition, a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in foreign currencies. exchange rates for some of these currencies against the u.s. dollar, particularly the yen, have been volatile in recent periods. if these currencies strengthen against the u.s. dollar, our manufacturing costs could significantly increase. in the event that the exchange rates for u.s. dollar adversely change against our foreign currency exposures in the euro, singapore dollar, new taiwan dollar, the yen and the yuan, our results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected.
we may make future acquisitions and/or alliances, which involve numerous risks.
acquisitions and the formation or operation of alliances, such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements, involve numerous risks including the following:
•   integrating the operations, technologies and products of acquired or newly formed entities into our operations;
•   increasing capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain facilities;
•   increased debt levels;
•   the assumption of unknown or underestimated liabilities;
•   the use of cash to finance a transaction, which may reduce the availability of cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and other business activities;
•   diverting management's attention from normal daily operations;
•   managing larger or more complex operations and facilities and employees in separate and diverse geographic areas;
•   requirements imposed by governmental authorities in connection with the regulatory review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures or restrictions on the conduct of our business or the acquired business;
•   inability to realize synergies or other expected benefits;
•   failure to maintain customer, vendor and other relationships;
•   inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company's internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and/or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices; and
•   impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions, technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the acquired business.
in recent years, supply of memory products has significantly exceeded customer demand resulting in significant declines in average selling prices for dram, nand flash and nor flash products. resulting operating losses have led to the deterioration in the financial condition of a number of industry participants, including the liquidation of qimonda and the 2012 bankruptcy filing by elpida (now known as mmj). these types of proceedings often lead to court-directed processes involving the sale of related businesses or assets. we believe the global memory industry is experiencing a period of consolidation as a result of these market conditions and other factors, and we may engage in discussions regarding potential acquisitions and similar opportunities arising out of these industry conditions. to the extent we are successful in completing any such transactions, we could be subject to some or all of the risks described above, including the risks pertaining to funding, assumption of liabilities, integration challenges and increases in debt that may accompany such transactions. acquisitions of, or alliances with, high-technology companies are inherently risky and may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
the limited availability of raw materials, supplies or capital equipment could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
our operations require raw materials, and in certain cases, third party services, that meet exacting standards. we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and services. however, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials and services that meet our standards. in some cases, materials, components or services are provided by a single supplier. various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials or components such as silicon wafers, controllers, photomasks, chemicals, gases, photoresist, lead frames and molding compound. shortages may occur from time to time in the future. we and/or our suppliers could be affected by laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change, which could increase the cost and limit the supply of our raw materials. in addition, disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials. lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past. if our supply of raw materials or services is disrupted or our lead times extended, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
our operations are dependent on our ability to procure advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment that enables the transition to lower cost manufacturing processes. for certain key types of equipment, including photolithography tools, we are sometimes dependent on a single supplier. from time to time we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to the supplier's limited capacity. our inability to timely obtain this equipment could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing processes and reduce costs. delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production at new facilities and increase our overall costs of the ramp. if we are unable to timely obtain advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including among others, singapore, where we currently have arrangements that allow us to compute our tax provision at rates below the local statutory rates. our domestic and international taxes are dependent upon the distribution of our earnings among these different jurisdictions. our provision for income taxes and cash tax liabilities in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including challenges by tax authorities to our tax structure, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws and regulations. we and our subsidiaries file income tax returns with the u.s. federal government, various u.s. states and various foreign jurisdictions throughout the world.  our u.s. federal and state tax returns remain open to examination for 2010 through 2014.  in addition, tax returns open to examination in multiple foreign taxing jurisdictions range from the years 2005 to 2014. the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability.
we may not utilize all of our net deferred tax assets.
we have substantial deferred tax assets, which include, among others, net operating loss and credit carryforwards. as of august 28, 2014, our u.s. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, including uncertain tax benefits, were $3.89 billion and $1.71 billion, respectively, which, if not utilized, will expire at various dates from 2015 through 2033. as of august 28, 2014, our foreign net operating loss carryforwards were $5.37 billion, including $3.95 billion pertaining to japan, which, if not utilized, substantially all will expire at various dates from 2018 through 2023. as of august 28, 2014, we had valuation allowances of $1.29 billion and $979 million against our net deferred tax assets in the u.s. and japan, respectively.
a downturn in the worldwide economy may harm our business.
downturns in the worldwide economy have harmed our business in the past and future downturns could also adversely affect our business. adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that incorporate our products, such as personal computers, mobile devices, solid-state drives and servers. reduced demand for these products could result in significant decreases in our average selling prices and product sales. a deterioration of current conditions in worldwide credit markets could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures. in addition, we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties. difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of loss on our accounts receivables due to credit defaults. as a result, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
our results of operations could be affected by natural disasters and other events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate.
we have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and geological events including earthquakes or tsunamis that could disrupt operations.  in addition, our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations.  a natural disaster, fire, explosion or other event that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations, or the operations of our customers or suppliers, may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
we face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
sales to customers outside the united states approximated 84% of our consolidated net sales for 2014. in addition, a substantial portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside the united states. in particular, a significant portion of our manufacturing operations are concentrated in taiwan, singapore and japan. our international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks, including:
•   export and import duties, changes to import and export regulations, customs regulations and processes and restrictions on the transfer of funds;
•   compliance with u.s. and international laws involving international operations, including the foreign corrupt practices act, export control laws and similar rules and regulations;
•   political and economic instability;
•   problems with the transportation or delivery of our products;
•   compliance with trade, technical standards and other laws in a variety of jurisdictions;
•   contractual and regulatory limitations on our ability to maintain flexibility with our staffing levels;
•   disruptions to our manufacturing operations as a result of actions imposed by foreign governments;
•   changes in economic policies of foreign governments; and these factors may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.
breaches of our network security could expose us to losses.
we manage and store on our network systems various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations. we also process, store, and transmit large amounts of data relating to our customers and employees, including sensitive personal information. computer programmers and hackers may be able to gain unauthorized access to our network system and steal proprietary information, compromise confidential information, create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. these parties may also be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that disrupt our operations and create security vulnerabilities. attacks on our network systems could result in significant losses and damage our reputation with customers.
we are subject to counterparty default risks.
we have numerous arrangements with financial institutions that subject us to counterparty default risks, including cash deposits, investments, capped-call contracts on our stock and derivative instruments. as a result, we are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these arrangements will default on its performance obligations. a counterparty may not comply with their contractual commitments which could then lead to their defaulting on their obligations with little or no notice to us, which could limit our ability to take action to mitigate our exposure. additionally, our ability to mitigate our exposures may be constrained by the terms of our contractual arrangements or because market conditions prevent us from taking effective action. if one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy, our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterparty's default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable laws governing the bankruptcy proceeding. in the event of such default, we could incur significant losses, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations or financial condition.
compliance with new regulations regarding the use of conflict minerals could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.
increased focus on environmental protection and social responsibility initiatives led to the passage of section 1502 of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 (the "dodd-frank act") and its implementing sec regulations.  the dodd-frank act imposes new supply chain diligence and disclosure requirements for certain manufacturers of products containing specific minerals that may originate in or near the democratic republic of the congo (the "drc") and finance or benefit local armed groups. these "conflict minerals" are commonly found in materials used in the manufacture of semiconductors. the implementation of these new regulations may limit the sourcing and availability of some of these materials. this in turn may affect our ability to obtain materials necessary for the manufacture of our products in sufficient quantities and may affect related material pricing. some of our customers may elect to disqualify us as a supplier if we are unable to verify that our products are drc conflict free.

overview for an overview of our business, see "item 1 - business - overview." our results of operations for 2014 were affected by the following key transaction.
acquisition of micron memory japan, inc.
on july 31, 2013, we completed the mmj acquisition, in which we acquired elpida, now known as mmj, and a controlling interest in rexchip, now known as mmt. in 2014, we purchased additional interests in mmt, increasing our ownership interest to 99.5%. in connection with the mmj acquisition, we recorded net assets of $2.60 billion, noncontrolling interests of $168 million and a gain on the transaction of $1.48 billion in 2013. in the second quarter of 2014, the provisional amounts recorded in connection with the mmj acquisition were adjusted, primarily for pre-petition liabilities. as a result, other non-operating expense for 2014 included these measurement period adjustments of $33 million. (see "item 8. financial statements - notes to consolidated financial statements - micron memory japan, inc." note.)
the mmj acquisition included a 300mm dram wafer fabrication facility located in hiroshima, japan, a 300mm dram wafer fabrication facility in taichung city, taiwan and an assembly and test facility located in akita, japan. these wafer fabrication facilities together represented approximately 30% of our total wafer capacity for 2014. the mmj group's products include mobile dram targeted to mobile phones and tablets, and computing dram targeted to desktop pcs, servers, notebooks and workstations. the operations from the mmj acquisition are included primarily in the mbu and cnbu segments.

business segments we have the following four business units, which are our reportable segments:
compute and networking business unit ("cnbu"):  includes dram and nor flash products sold to the compute, networking, graphics and cloud server markets.
mobile business unit ("mbu"):  includes dram, nand flash and nor flash products sold to the smartphone, feature phone and tablet mobile-device market.
storage business unit ("sbu"):  includes nand flash components and ssds sold into enterprise and client storage, cloud and removable storage markets. sbu also includes nand flash products sold to intel through our imft joint venture.
embedded business unit ("ebu"):  includes dram, nand flash and nor flash products sold into automotive and industrial applications, as well as the connected home and consumer electronics markets.
our other operations do not meet the thresholds of a reportable segment and are reported under all other. in the third quarter of 2014, we reorganized our business units. all prior period amounts reflect this reorganization.
total net sales for 2014 increased 80% as compared to 2013 primarily due to higher cnbu and mbu sales resulting from the mmj acquisition. net sales for all segments in 2014 also benefitted, as compared to 2013, from increases in dram and nand flash sales volumes driven primarily by higher manufacturing output as a result of improvements in product and process technology and an increased share of output from inotera.
total net sales for 2013 increased 10% as compared to 2012 reflecting increases in cnbu, ebu and mbu sales primarily due to higher levels of dram and nand flash gigabit sales volumes partially offset by declines in average selling prices. the increases in gigabit sales volumes for 2013 were primarily attributable to manufacturing efficiencies driven by improvements in product and process technologies, increased dram supply from inotera due to the restructuring of our supply agreement and $355 million of dram sales from the mmj acquisition after its acquisition on july 31, 2013.
gross margin our overall gross margin percentage improved to 33% for 2014 from 20% for 2013 primarily due to improvements in the gross margin percentage for cnbu and mbu as a result of higher margins for dram products. the gross margin improvements for cnbu and mbu for 2014 as compared to 2013 resulted primarily from the mmj acquisition, manufacturing cost reductions and higher average selling prices for cnbu.
through december 2012, we purchased 50% of inotera's wafer production capacity based on a margin-sharing formula among nanya, inotera and us. since january 2013, we have purchased substantially all of inotera's dram output at a discount from market prices for our comparable components under a new supply agreement (the "inotera supply agreement"). our costs for supply from inotera increased in 2014 from 2013 due to increases in average selling prices for our dram products and the changes in the pricing terms. the inotera supply agreement has a three-year term (currently through december 2016) that contemplates annual negotiations with respect to potential successive one-year extensions. if the parties do not agree to an extension, the agreement will terminate following the end of the then-existing term plus a subsequent three-year wind-down period. in the event of a wind-down, our share of inotera's capacity would decline over the wind-down period. in 2014, our cost of products purchased from inotera was significantly higher than our cost of similar products manufactured in our wholly-owned facilities. we are currently in negotiations regarding the extension of the inotera supply agreement. there can be no assurance that we will be able to reach an agreement. under the inotera supply agreements, we purchased $2.68 billion, $1.26 billion, and $646 million of dram products in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
our gross margin percentage on sales of dram products for 2014 improved from 2013 primarily due to reductions in costs and increases in average selling prices. cost reductions for 2014 primarily reflected improvements in product and process technologies and the comparatively lower manufacturing costs of the mmj group, partially offset by higher costs for product obtained under the inotera supply agreements. for 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2013, our costs of goods sold for dram products included the sale of the mmj group's inventories recorded at fair value in the mmj acquisition, which was higher than the manufacturing cost of such inventories. this increased our costs of goods sold by approximately $153 million for 2014 and $41 million for 2013.
our overall gross margin percentage improved to 20% for 2013 from 12% for 2012 due to improvements in the gross margin percentage for cnbu, and to a lesser extent ebu, sbu and mbu, primarily due to manufacturing cost reductions partially offset by declines in average selling prices. manufacturing cost reductions for 2013 primarily resulted from improvements in product and process technologies.

operating income (loss)           1,957                 160                (458   )
cnbu sales and operating results track closely with our average selling prices, gigabit sales volumes and cost per gigabit for our consolidated sales of dram products. (see "operating results by product - dram" for further detail.) cnbu sales for 2014 increased 112% as compared to 2013 primarily due to (1) the mmj acquisition, (2) higher average selling prices, (3) increased dram supply from inotera as a result of the restructuring of our supply agreement and (4) higher output due to improvements in product and process technologies. cnbu sales for 2014 as compared to 2013 were adversely impacted by the transition of production at one of our singapore wafer fabrication facilities from dram to nand flash. cnbu operating income for 2014 improved from 2013 primarily due to the mmj acquisition, higher average selling prices and manufacturing cost reductions.
cnbu sales for 2013 increased 30% as compared to 2012 primarily due to increases in gigabits sold partially offset by declines in average selling prices. cnbu operating margin for 2013 improved from 2012 primarily due to manufacturing cost reductions as a result of improved product and process technologies partially offset by declines in average selling prices. cnbu results of operations for 2013 included sales of $153 million and operating income of $21 million from the acquired mmj group. cnbu sales and operating margins for 2012 were adversely impacted by a $58 million charge for a settlement with a customer.
operating income (loss)             683                (265   )            (371   )
in 2014, mbu sales were comprised primarily of dram, nand flash and nor flash, in decreasing order of revenue, with mobile dram products accounting for a significant majority of the sales. mbu sales for 2014 increased 199% as compared to 2013 primarily due significant increases in mobile dram sales as a result of the mmj acquisition. mbu operating margin for 2014 also improved from 2013 primarily due to the mmj acquisition and manufacturing cost reductions, which significantly outpaced declines in average selling prices.
mbu sales increased 3% for 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily due to higher sales of mobile dram products as a result of the mmj acquisition partially offset by declines in sales of wireless nor flash products. mbu results of operations for 2013 included sales of $192 million and operating income of $22 million from the mmj group. sales of wireless nor flash products declined in 2014 as a result of weakness in market demand and our customer group in particular, as well as a continued transition by customers to nand flash. the improvement in mbu operating margin for 2013 from 2012 was primarily due to reductions in manufacturing, sg&a and r&d costs.
operating income               255                 173                 199
sbu sales and operating results track closely with our average selling prices, gigabit sales volumes and cost per gigabit for our sales of nand flash products. (see "operating results by product - nand flash" for further detail.) sbu sales for 2014 increased 23% from 2013 primarily due to increases in gigabits sold partially offset by declines in average selling prices. increases in gigabits sold for 2014 were primarily due to the transition in 2014 of production at one of our wafer fabrication facilities in singapore from dram to nand flash and improvements in product and process technologies. sbu sells a portion of its products to intel through our imft joint venture at long-term negotiated prices approximating cost. sbu sales of nand flash products to intel under this arrangement were $423 million, $387 million and $718 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. all other sbu products are sold to oems, resellers, retailers and other customers (including intel), which we collectively refer to as "trade customers."
sbu sales of nand flash products to trade customers for 2014 increased 26% as compared to 2013 primarily due to an increase in gigabits sold partially offset by declines in average selling prices. sbu operating income for 2014 improved from 2013 primarily due to higher gigabit sales volumes as manufacturing cost reductions were essentially offset by declines in average selling prices.
sbu sales for 2013 were relatively unchanged from 2012 as increases in gigabits sold were partially offset by declines in average selling prices. increases in gigabits sold for 2013 were primarily due to improvements in product and process technologies. sbu sales of nand flash products to trade customers for 2013 increased 22% as compared to 2012 primarily due to increases in gigabits sold partially offset by declines in average selling prices. on april 6, 2012, we acquired intel's interests and supply rights from im flash wafer fabrication facilities in singapore and virginia, resulting in subsequent increases in our sales to trade customers. sbu operating income for 2013 declined from 2012 primarily due to decreases in average selling prices and increases in r&d costs mitigated by manufacturing cost reductions. manufacturing cost reductions resulted primarily from improvements in product and process technologies.
operating income               331                 227                 129
in 2014, ebu sales were comprised of dram, nand flash and nor flash in decreasing order of revenue. ebu sales for 2014 increased 39% as compared to 2013 primarily due to increased sales volumes of dram and nand flash products partially offset by declines in average selling prices. ebu operating income for 2014 improved as compared to 2013 primarily due to higher margins on sales of dram and nand flash products as a result of the increase in sales and cost reductions.
in 2013, ebu sales were comprised of dram, nor flash and nand flash in decreasing order of revenue. ebu sales increased 16% for 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily due to increased sales volumes of dram, nand flash and nor flash products as ebu continued to expand its customer base, partially offset by declines in average selling prices. ebu operating income for 2013 improved from 2012 primarily due to manufacturing cost reductions and higher sales volumes partially offset by declines in average selling prices.
operating results by product net sales by product for the year ended                           2014                           2013                           2012
in order to balance our future product mix in anticipation of the closing of the mmj acquisition, in the fourth quarter of 2013, we began to transition production at one of our wafer fabrication facilities in singapore from dram to nand flash. this transition to nand flash production is substantially complete. during this period of transition, there was a marginal reduction in wafer production.
(percentage change from prior period)
the increase in gigabit sales of dram products for 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to higher production volumes resulting from the mmj acquisition, increased supply under the new inotera supply agreement and improved product and process technologies, partially offset by the transition of one of our wafer fabrication facilities in singapore from dram to nand flash. in 2014, dram products produced by our mmj group facilities constituted 54% of our aggregate dram gigabit production as compared to 9% in 2013.
in 2014, our cost of products purchased from inotera was significantly higher than our cost of similar products manufactured in our wholly-owned facilities and were higher than our costs in 2013. dram products acquired from inotera accounted for 38% of our dram gigabit production for 2014 as compared to 54% for 2013 and 46% for 2012.
our gross margin percentage on sales of dram products for 2014 improved from 2013 primarily due to reductions in costs and increases in average selling prices. cost reductions for 2014 primarily reflected improvements in product and process technologies and the comparatively lower manufacturing costs of the mmj group, partially offset by higher costs for product obtained under the inotera supply agreement and the sale of the mmj group's inventories recorded in the mmj acquisition.
the increase in gigabit sales of dram products for 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily due to increased output obtained from our inotera joint venture under the new supply agreement, improved product and process technologies and the mmj acquisition on july 31, 2013. our gross margin percentage on sales of dram products for 2013 improved from 2012 primarily due to manufacturing cost reductions as a result of improvements in product and process technologies partially offset by declines in average selling prices. dram sales and gross margins for 2012 were adversely impacted by the effects of a $58 million charge to revenue for a settlement with a customer.
nand flash we sell a portion of our output of nand flash products to intel through imft at long-term negotiated prices approximating cost. (see "operating results by business segments - storage business unit" for further detail.) we sell the remainder of our nand flash products to trade customers.
(percentage change from prior period)
sales to trade customers:
increases in nand flash gigabits sold to trade customers for 2014 as compared to 2013 were primarily due to the transition of one of our wafer fabrication facilities in singapore from dram to nand flash production and improved product and process technologies. our gross margin percentage on sales of trade nand flash products for 2014 was relatively unchanged from 2013 as manufacturing cost reductions offset declines in average selling prices. manufacturing cost reductions for 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily resulted from improvements in product and process technologies.
increases in nand flash gigabits sold to trade customers for 2013 as compared to 2012 were primarily due to improved product and process technologies, increased output available for sale to trade customers due to the restructure of our im flash agreement with intel in april 2012 and the ramp-up of our fabrication facility in singapore throughout 2012. our gross margin percentage on sales of nand flash products for 2013 improved from 2012 as manufacturing cost reductions outpaced declines in average selling prices. manufacturing cost reductions for 2013 as compared to 2012 reflect improvements in product and process technologies.
nor flash sales of nor flash products for 2014 declined as compared to 2013 primarily due to decreases in sales of wireless nor flash products as a result of the continued transition of wireless applications to nand flash products. our gross margin percentage on sales of nor flash products for 2014 declined as compared to 2013 primarily due to costs of underutilized capacity in connection with the decrease in production of wireless products and decreases in average selling prices.
sales of nor flash products for 2013 declined as compared to 2012 primarily due to decreases in sales of wireless nor flash products as a result of weakness in demand from certain customers and the continued transition of wireless applications to nand flash products, which led to significant declines in average selling prices. our gross margin percentage on sales of nor flash products for 2013 improved as compared to 2012 primarily due to cost reductions.
operating expenses and other selling, general and administrative sg&a expenses for 2014 increased 26% as compared to 2013 primarily due to the incremental costs resulting from the mmj acquisition and higher payroll costs resulting primarily from the reinstatement of variable pay plans. we expect that sg&a expenses will approximate $195 million to $205 million for the first quarter of 2015.
sg&a expenses for 2013 decreased 9% as compared to 2012 primarily due to a reduction in legal costs and lower variable pay costs partially offset by $50 million of consulting and other costs incurred in connection with the mmj acquisition.
research and development r&d expenses for 2014 increased 47% from 2013 primarily due to the incremental costs resulting from the mmj acquisition, higher payroll costs resulting primarily from the reinstatement of variable pay plans and increased resources dedicated to development efforts. we expect that r&d expenses, net of amounts reimbursable from our r&d partners, will be approximately $395 million to $405 million for the first quarter of 2015.
r&d expenses for 2013 increased 1% from 2012 primarily due to lower reimbursements from nanya under partnering arrangements offset by lower payroll costs primarily resulting from the suspension of variable pay plans and a lower volume of development wafers processed.
as a result of amounts reimbursable from intel under a joint development program for nand flash and certain emerging memory technologies, r&d expenses were reduced by $137 million, $127 million and $87 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. as a result of amounts reimbursable from nanya under a dram r&d joint development program, r&d expenses were reduced by $19 million and $138 million for 2013 and 2012, respectively. effective january 1, 2013, nanya ceased participating in the dram joint development program.
our process technology r&d efforts are focused primarily on development of successively smaller line-width process technologies which are designed to facilitate our transition to next generation memory products. additional process technology r&d efforts focus on the enablement of advanced computing and mobile memory architectures, the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise and the development of new manufacturing materials. product design and development efforts include our high density ddr3 and ddr4 dram, mobile lpdram products, high density nand flash memory (including 3d nand and mlc and tlc technologies), ssds, hybrid memory cubes, specialty memory, nor flash memory, and other memory technologies and systems.

in order to optimize operations, improve efficiency and increase our focus on our core memory operations, we have entered into various restructure activities. for 2014 and 2013, other restructure included charges associated with our efforts to wind down our 200mm operations primarily in agrate, italy and kiryat gat, israel and charges associated with workforce optimization activities, primarily related to our mbu and ebu operating segments. as of august 28, 2014, we had accrued $14 million for unpaid other restructure activities related to our workforce optimization activity. as of august 28, 2014, we do not anticipate incurring any significant additional costs for these restructure activities. (see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - restructure and asset impairments.")
net interest expense for 2014, 2013 and 2012, included aggregate amounts of amortization of debt discount and other costs of $167 million, $122 million and $81 million, respectively.
income taxes income tax provision (benefit) for 2014 included $249 million of expenses related to the utilization of deferred tax assets by the mmj group partially offset by a $190 million benefit from increases in amount of mmj group's deferred tax assets expected to be realized based on our forecasted utilization of net operating losses. the remaining tax provision for 2014 primarily reflects taxes on our other non-u.s. operations. the provision (benefit) for taxes on u.s. operations for 2014 was substantially offset by changes in the valuation allowance. as of august 28, 2014, we had valuation allowances of $1.29 billion against substantially all u.s. net deferred tax assets and $1.15 billion related to our foreign subsidiaries, primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards. our valuation allowance decreased $712 million for 2014 primarily due to the utilization of u.s. and foreign net operating losses and due to the $190 million benefit to deferred tax assets of the mmj group. the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted if significant positive evidence increases. management continues to evaluate future financial performance to determine whether such performance is sufficient evidence to support reversal of the valuation allowances. our unrecognized tax benefits increased $150 million in 2014, primarily due to transfer pricing and other matters, which was substantially offset by changes in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance.
we currently operate in several tax jurisdictions where we have arrangements that allow us to compute our tax provision at rates below the local statutory rates that expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2026.  these arrangements benefitted our tax provision in 2014, 2013 and 2012 by $286 million, $141 million and $52 million, respectively.
income taxes for 2013 and 2012 primarily reflect taxes on our non-u.s. operations offset by benefits of $19 million and $56 million, respectively, from the favorable resolution of prior year tax matters and a change in tax laws applicable to prior years.
(see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - income taxes.")
equity in net income (loss) of equity method investees we recognize our share of earnings or losses from the entities listed below under the equity method, generally on a two-month lag.  equity in net income (loss) of equity method investees, net of tax, included the following:
our equity in net income (loss) of inotera improved for 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to inotera's improved operating results as a result of higher selling prices and lower manufacturing costs. higher selling prices resulted from the new inotera supply agreement coupled with an improved market.
losses in 2012 for our other equity method investments were primarily attributable to transform solar pty ltd. as of august 30, 2012, transform's operations were substantially discontinued. (see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - equity method investments.")
other operating and non-operating in 2014, we settled all pending litigation between us and rambus, including all antitrust and patent matters, and entered into a patent cross-license agreement.  as a result, other operating expense for 2014 included a $233 million charge to accrue a liability, which reflects the discounted value of amounts due under this arrangement. (see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - contingencies" note.)
other non-operating expense for 2014 included losses from the restructure of our debt of $184 million. other non-operating expense for 2013 included losses of $31 million from the restructure of our debt. (see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - debt" note.)
other non-operating expense included losses from changes in currency exchange rates of $28 million, $229 million and $6 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. the loss for 2013 includes a $228 million loss for currency contracts to hedge our yen-denominated obligations in connection with the mmj acquisition. (see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - derivative instruments" note.)
on august 15, 2014, on semiconductor corporation acquired aptina for approximately $433 million and we recognized a non-operating gain of $119 million on the sale of our shares based on our diluted ownership interest of approximately 27%.
on may 15, 2014, inotera issued 400 million common shares in a public offering at a price equal to 31.50 new taiwan dollars per share, which was in excess of our carrying value per share. as a result of the issuance, our ownership interest decreased from 35% to 33% and we recognized a non-operating gain of $93 million in 2014.
further discussion of other operating and non-operating income and expenses can be found in the following notes contained in "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements":
•   other operating (income) expense, net
•   other non-operating income (expense), net liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and financing obtained from capital markets. specifically, in 2014, we generated cash from operations of $5.70 billion and obtained $2.21 billion of proceeds from issuance of debt. cash generated from operations is highly dependent on selling prices for our products, which can vary significantly from period to period. we are continuously evaluating alternatives for efficiently financing our capital expenditures, dilution-management activities (including repurchases of convertible notes or equity) and ongoing operations. we expect, from time to time in the future, to engage in a variety of transactions for such purposes, including the issuance or incurrence of secured and unsecured debt and the refinancing and restructuring of existing debt.
on october 27, 2014, we announced that our board of directors authorized the discretionary repurchase of up to
$1.00 billion of our outstanding common stock. any repurchases under the new authorization may be made in open market purchases, block trades, privately negotiated transactions and/or derivative transactions, subject to market conditions and our ongoing determination that it is the best use of available cash. we expect to use cash on hand to fund any repurchases. the repurchase authorization does not obligate us to acquire any common stock.
as of                                                           2014                2013
money market funds                                         1,281               1,188
certificates of deposit                                      410                  47
long-term marketable investments                            $819                $499
as of august 28, 2014, $2.80 billion of our cash and equivalents and short-term investments was held by foreign subsidiaries, of which $758 million was denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. to mitigate credit risk, we invest through high-credit-quality financial institutions and, by policy, generally limit the concentration of credit exposure by restricting the amount of investments with any single obligor.
limitations on the use of cash and investments mmj group:  cash and equivalents and short-term investments in the table above included an aggregate of $1.60 billion held by the mmj group as of august 28, 2014. as a result of the corporate reorganization proceedings of the mmj companies entered into in march 2012 and for so long as such proceedings are continuing, the mmj companies and their subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions on dividends, loans and advances. the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies prohibit the mmj companies from paying dividends, including any cash dividends, to us and require that excess earnings be used in their businesses or to fund the mmj companies' installment payments. these prohibitions also effectively prevent the subsidiaries of the mmj companies from paying cash dividends to us as any such dividends would have to be first paid to the mmj companies which are prohibited from repaying those amounts to us as dividends under the plans of reorganization. in addition, pursuant to an order of the japan court, the mmj companies cannot make loans or advances, other than certain ordinary course advances, to us without the consent of the japan court. moreover, loans or advances by subsidiaries of the mmj companies may be considered outside of the ordinary course of business and subject to approval of the legal trustee and japan court. as a result, the assets of the mmj group, while available to satisfy the mmj companies' installment payments and the other obligations, capital expenditures and other operating needs of the mmj group, are not available for use by us in our other operations. moreover, certain uses of the assets of the mmj group, including investments in certain capital expenditures and in mmt, may require consent of mmj's trustees and/or the japan court.
imft: cash and equivalents and short-term investments in the table above included $84 million held by imft as of august 28, 2014. our ability to access funds held by imft to finance our other operations is subject to agreement by intel and contractual limitations. amounts held by imft are not anticipated to be available to finance our other operations.
indefinitely reinvested: as of august 28, 2014, we had $2.70 billion of cash and equivalents and short-term investments that were held by foreign subsidiaries whose earnings were considered to be indefinitely reinvested and repatriation of these funds to the u.s. would subject these funds to u.s. federal income taxes. determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities related to investments in these foreign subsidiaries is not practicable.
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was $5.70 billion for 2014, due primarily to a strong market for our products and our continued focus on cost-efficient operations.  operating cash flows in 2014 also benefitted by a $671 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses offset by a $518 million increase in receivables.
investing activities net cash used for investing activities was $2.45 billion for 2014, which consisted primarily of cash expenditures of $2.66 billion for property plant and equipment and $506 million for the acquisition of available-for-sale securities (net of proceeds from sales and maturities of $557 million) offset by the use of $534 million of restricted cash in connection with the first mmj creditor installment payment.
we believe that to develop new product and process technologies, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality, we must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies, facilities and capital equipment, and r&d. we estimate that capital spending for 2015 will be approximately $3.6 billion to $4.0 billion. the actual amounts for 2015 will vary depending on market conditions. as of august 28, 2014, we had commitments of approximately $1.18 billion for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment, substantially all of which is expected to be paid within one year.
financing activities net cash used by financing activities was $1.95 billion for 2014, which included $3.84 billion for repayments of debt (including $1.20 billion for the amount in excess of principal of our convertible notes), $479 million of payments on equipment purchase contracts and $92 million of net cash received from noncontrolling interests offset by $2.21 billion of proceeds from issuance of debt and by $265 million of proceeds from issuance of common stock under our equity plans.
2014 debt restructure throughout 2014, we reduced the dilutive effects of our convertible notes by exchanging, converting or repurchasing a portion of these notes using cash generated from operations and proceeds from issuing non-convertible debt with near investment-grade covenants. approximately 90% of our free cash flow (cash flows from operating activities less expenditures for property, plant and equipment less payments on equipment purchase contracts) generated during 2014 was used for these dilution-management activities. as a result, we eliminated convertible notes that would have been converted into 118 million shares of our common stock.
in 2014, we initiated a series of actions to restructure our debt, including exchanges, conversions and settlements, repurchases, issuances and early repayments. the following table presents the net effect of each of the actions:
exchanges                                           $585                                       $282                                     $-               $(238             )                $49
(1)   the loss on 2014 debt restructure activities was recorded as $184 million in other non-operating expense and $21 million in interest expense in 2014.
(2) the change in carrying value includes an increase of $275 million for the reclassification of the fair value of the equity component to debt in connection with our election to settle the conversions of the 2031b notes in cash.
•   exchanges: exchanged $440 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2027 notes, 2031a notes and 2031b notes into $1.03 billion principal amount at maturity of 2043g notes.
•   conversions and settlement: holders of substantially all of our remaining 2014 notes, 2027 notes and 2031a notes (with an aggregate principal amount of $770 million) converted their notes and we settled the conversions in cash for $1.45 billion.
•   repurchases: repurchased $320 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2031b notes, 2032c notes and 2032d notes in privately-negotiated transactions for an aggregate of $857 million in cash.
•   issuances: issued $600 million in principal amount of 5.875% senior notes due february 2022 and $1.15 billion in principal amount of 5.500% senior notes due february 2025. issued $462 million in principal amount of 1.258% senior notes due 2019 notes, payable in 10 semi-annual installments commencing in july 2014.
•   early repayments: repaid $334 million of notes and capital leases prior to their scheduled maturities.
subsequent to 2014, we settled an aggregate principal amount of $114 million of our remaining 2031b notes for $389 million and repaid a $120 million note prior to its scheduled maturity.
available credit facilities: as of august 28, 2014, we had credit facilities available that provide for up to $408 million of additional financing, subject to outstanding balances of trade receivables and other conditions.
(see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - debt" note.)
potential settlement obligations of convertible notes since the closing price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days in the 30 trading day periods ended on june 30, 2014 and september 30, 2014 exceeded 130% of the initial conversion price per share of our 2032 notes and 2033 notes, holders of those notes have the right to convert their notes at any time through december 31, 2014. for our convertible notes, we have: (1) the requirement to pay cash for the principal amount and the option to pay either cash, shares of our common stock or any combination thereof for any remaining conversion obligation, or (2) the option to pay cash, issue shares of common stock or any combination thereof for the aggregate amount due upon conversion.
the following table summarizes the potential settlements, as of august 28, 2014, that we could be required to make if all holders converted their 2032 notes and 2033 notes:
(1)   we are required to settle the principal amount of the 2033 notes in cash. the remaining conversion obligation paid in shares is based on our closing share price of $32.81 as of august 28, 2014.
(2)   based on our closing share price of $32.81 as of august 28, 2014. assumes we elect cash settlement for the entire obligation.
contractual obligations payments due by period as of august 28, 2014                           total            less than 1 year         1-3 years             3-5 years               more than 5 years notes payable(1)(2)                        $7,959                    $976                    $1,001                $1,601                  $4,381
capital lease obligations(2)                  998                     356                       404                   115                     123
operating leases(3)                           116                      22                        32                    25                      37
(1) amounts include mmj creditor installment payments, convertible notes and other notes. any future redemption or conversion of convertible debt could impact the amount and timing of our cash payments.
(4) amounts represent future cash payments to satisfy other long-term liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, including $335 million for the current portion of these long-term liabilities.
(5) we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities; therefore, $255 million in aggregate of long-term income taxes payable and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities has been excluded from the preceding table. however, other noncurrent liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet included these uncertain tax positions and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities.
the obligations disclosed above do not include current liabilities, except for the current portion of long-term debt. the expected timing of payment amounts of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information. timing and actual amounts paid may differ depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services, market prices, changes to agreed-upon amounts or timing of certain events for some obligations.
purchase obligations include all commitments to purchase goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity that meet any of the following criteria: (1) they are noncancellable, (2) we would incur a penalty if the agreement was canceled, or (3) we must make specified minimum payments even if we do not take delivery of the contracted products or services ("take-or-pay"). if the obligation to purchase goods or services is noncancellable, the entire value of the contract was included in the above table. if the obligation is cancellable, but we would incur a penalty if canceled, the dollar amount of the penalty was included as a purchase obligation. contracted minimum amounts specified in take-or-pay contracts are also included in the above table as they represent the portion of each contract that is a firm commitment.
under the inotera supply agreement, effective on january 1, 2013, we are obligated to purchase for a three-year term (currently through december 2016) substantially all of inotera's output at a purchase price based on a discount from market prices for our comparable components. the inotera supply agreement contemplates annual negotiations with respect to potential successive one-year extensions, and if the parties do not agree to an extension, the agreement will terminate following the end of the then-existing term plus a subsequent three-year wind-down period. in the event of a wind-down, our share of inotera's capacity would decline over the three year wind-down period. we purchased $2.68 billion of dram products from inotera in 2014 under the inotera supply agreement. the inotera supply agreement does not contain a fixed or minimum purchase quantity as quantities are based on qualified production output and pricing fluctuates as it is based on market prices. therefore, we did not include our obligations under the inotera supply agreement in the contractual obligations table above.
off-balance sheet arrangements we have entered into capped calls, which are intended to reduce the effect of potential dilution from our convertible notes.  the capped calls provide for our receipt of cash or shares, at our election, from our counterparties if the trading price of our stock is above a specified initial strike price at the expiration dates. the amounts receivable varies based on the trading price of our stock, up to specified cap prices. the dollar value of the cash or shares that we would receive from the capped calls on their expiration dates ranges from $0 if the trading price of our stock is below the initial strike price for all of the capped calls to $864 million if the trading price of our stock is at or above the cap price for all of the capped calls. to purchase the capped calls, we paid $57 million in 2011, $103 million in 2012 and $48 million in 2013, respectively. the amounts paid were recorded as charges to additional capital. for further details of our capped call arrangements, see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data - notes to consolidated financial statements - equity - micron shareholders' equity - capped calls" note.
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with u.s. gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures.  estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, forecasted events and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.  estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions.  we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis.  our management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments.
business acquisitions: accounting for acquisitions requires us to estimate the fair value of consideration paid and the individual assets and liabilities acquired, which involves a number of judgments, assumptions and estimates that could materially affect the amount and timing of costs recognized.  accounting for acquisitions can also involve significant judgment to determine when control of the acquired entity is transferred. we typically obtain independent third party valuation studies to assist in determining fair values, including assistance in determining future cash flows, appropriate discount rates and comparable market values. the items involving the most significant assumptions, estimates and judgments included determining the fair value of the following:
•   property, plant and equipment, including determination of values in a continued-use model;
•   deferred tax assets, including projections of future taxable income and tax rates;
•   inventory, including estimated future selling prices, timing of product sales and completion costs for work in process; and
•   debt, including discount rate and timing of payments.
consolidations: we have interests in joint venture entities that are vies.  determining whether to consolidate a vie requires judgment in assessing (1) whether an entity is a vie and (2) if we are the entity's primary beneficiary.  to determine if we are the primary beneficiary of a vie, we evaluate whether we have (a) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vie's economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie.  our evaluation includes identification of significant activities and an assessment of our ability to direct those activities based on governance provisions and arrangements to provide or receive product and process technology, product supply, operations services, equity funding and financing and other applicable agreements and circumstances.  our assessment of whether we are the primary beneficiary of our vies requires significant assumptions and judgment.
contingencies: we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies.  considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies.  an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.  we accrue a liability and charge operations for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date. in accounting for the resolution of contingencies, considerable judgment is necessary to estimate amounts pertaining to periods prior to the resolution, which are charged to operations in the period of resolution, and amounts related to future periods.
income taxes: we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world.  these estimates involve judgment and interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex.  resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year.  we are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with u.s. gaap, which requires the assessment of our performance and other relevant factors.  realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income. in recent periods, our results of operations have benefitted from increases in the amount of deferred taxes we expect to realize, primarily from the levels of capital spending and increases in the amount of taxable income we expect to realize in japan and taiwan. our income tax provision or benefit is dependent, in part, on our ability to forecast future taxable income in these and other jurisdictions. such forecasts are inherently difficult and involve numerous judgments including, among others, projecting future average selling prices and sales volumes, manufacturing and overhead costs, levels of capital spending and other factors that significantly impact our analyses of the amount of net deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized.
inventories: inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market value.  cost includes labor, material and overhead costs, including product and process technology costs.  determining market value of inventories involves numerous judgments, including projecting average selling prices and sales volumes for future periods and costs to complete products in work in process inventories.  to project average selling prices and sales volumes, we review recent sales volumes, existing customer orders, current contract prices, industry analyses of supply and demand, seasonal factors, general economic trends and other information.  when these analyses reflect estimated market values below our manufacturing costs, we record a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when the inventory is actually sold.  differences in forecasted average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or market adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of product inventories and accordingly the amount of write-down recorded.  for example, a 5% variance in the estimated selling prices would have changed the estimated market value of our memory inventory by approximately $254 million as of august 28, 2014.  due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory industry, actual selling prices and volumes often vary significantly from projected prices and volumes and, as a result, the timing of when product costs are charged to operations can vary significantly.
u.s. gaap provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to market values.  the amount of any inventory write-down can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories.   inventories are primarily categorized as memory (including dram, nand flash and nor flash) for purposes of determining lower of average cost or market. the major characteristics we consider in determining inventory categories are product type and markets.
property, plant and equipment: we review the carrying value of property, plant and equipment for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and/or disposition.  in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets.  the estimation of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require judgment by us, including, but not limited to, future use of the assets for our operations versus sale or disposal of the assets, future selling prices for our products and future production and sales volumes.  in addition, judgment is required in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performed.
research and development: costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as r&d as incurred.  determining when product development is complete requires judgment by us.  we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability.  subsequent to product qualification, product costs are valued in inventory.
stock-based compensation: stock-based compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense using the straight-line amortization method over the requisite service period.  for performance-based stock awards, the expense recognized is dependent on the probability of the performance measure being achieved.  we utilize forecasts of future performance to assess these probabilities and this assessment requires considerable judgment.
determining the appropriate fair-value model and calculating the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment, including estimating stock price volatility, expected option life and forfeiture rates.  we develop these estimates based on historical data and market information which can change significantly over time.  a small change in the estimates used can result in a relatively large change in the estimated valuation.  we use the black-scholes option valuation model to value employee stock awards.  we estimate stock price volatility based on an average of its historical volatility and the implied volatility derived from traded options on our stock.
